suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts . " currently there 's a tendency to be pessimistic in germany , " the government 's economic advisory council wrote in its last annual report .
but despite bleak growth outlooks , the situation in germany apparently is n't quite as desolate as commonly thought . for example , real wages in germany dropped by 0.9 percent over the last few years while they rose by 7.4 percent on average in the 15 old eu states , according to a report by the institute for economic and social sciences of the hans böckler foundation -lrb- wsi -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's apparently not getting too much money though that may sound bleak for wage-earners , it 's good for business , and the reason why germany leads the world in terms of exports , according to wsi 's thorsten schulten .
he added that a sound export market is also a good indicator for international competitiveness . " as these numbers show , it makes no sense to say that germany 's trade unions have too much power or that wages are too high , " he said . apples and oranges comparing germany to countries with lower wages such as poland and the czech republic is also futile , according to rolf kroker of german economic institute in cologne -lrb- iw -rrb- . productivity is much higher in germany , which can also rely on well-trained and well-qualified workers despite talk about the country 's faltering educational system , kroker added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german researchers are doing well " we 're really doing well in the field of mathematics and natural sciences as well as engineering , " he said , adding that germany 's ageing population will create problems in the long run . foreign investors do notice the current advantages of setting up shop in germany .
according to a report by ernst & young , the country takes the no. 5 spot - behind china , the us , india and poland - in a global ranking of favorite places to do business .
germany got best grades for research in development in the survey . awash with innovation with 23,000 new registrations at the european patent office , germans came in third behind the us and japan last year .
most entries came from the country 's automotive , electronic , machine construction , medical and environmental technology sectors .
in terms of the government 's support for innovation , germany comes in at the european average with 2.5 percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state 's still taking too much money from companies , according to some the area where changes are most needed is the country 's fiscal policies : german corporate taxes can not compete internationally , but the government 's reform plans have been put on hold because of likely early elections in the fall . " that 's the first thing the new government needs to deal with , " kroker said . bad bureaucracy bureaucracy is another problem . " the high degree of regulation , an inflexible labor market and high social standards all deter investors , " ernst & young 's peter englisch said , adding that other countries such as china , india and the eastern european states were benefiting from this . but access to financial investors , a good infrastructure and germany 's central location within europe were big advantages , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future 's bright ?
kroker also listed the country 's rule of law and political stability as further positive factors . " you should n't underestimate the importance of a functioning society : germany 's might be complex , but it is n't corrupt , " he added .
" that creates reliability . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .

lufthansa is also barred from offering more flights on the affected routes so that any new entrant would have a fair chance to establish itself as a credible competitor . lufthansa said the decision to give up the slots at several european airports would not significantly change its competitive position or hit its earnings .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .

lufthansa is also barred from offering more flights on the affected routes so that any new entrant would have a fair chance to establish itself as a credible competitor . lufthansa said the decision to give up the slots at several european airports would not significantly change its competitive position or hit its earnings .
" it will not greatly impact on our competitive position , " a spokeswoman said and added that the company is still maintaining its full-year profit targets . lufthansa said previously that it expects operating profit for 2005 to be on a par with the 383 million euros it recorded last year . lufthansa group last year had revenue of nearly 17 billion euros , with its more than 90,000 staff members transporting 50.9 million passengers and 1.75 million tons of cargo .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 05.07.2005 spd presents election manifesto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has " trust in germany , " but do germans trust the spd ?
germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .
the party 's leader said that the spd would wage its campaign under the motto " trust in germany . " in an attempt to win back traditional working class voters , germany 's social democrats have veered to the left in their election manifesto which includes higher taxes for the rich and minimum wages for the poor . but spd leader franz müntefering also said that the party leadership agreed to support gerhard schröder as the spd 's choice for chancellor and that the sweeping welfare cuts and labor market reforms known as agenda 2010 are here to stay . bildunterschrift : der spd-vorsitzende franz muentefering stellt auf einer pressekonferenz im willy-brandt-haus in berlin am montag , 4.juli 2005 , das wahlmanifest seiner partei fuer die geplante bundestagswahl im september vor .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz muentefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections , on monday july 4 , 2005 in berlin .
word in background reads " germany " .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- " we want to shape german policies together with chancellor schröder over the next four years , " müntefering said .
" our prime focus for these years will be on employment , security and a life with dignity for all . " courting middle class voters with the reformist agenda 2010 platform , the social democrats are aiming at middle class voters who guaranteed the spd 's success in general elections in 1998 and 2002 .
in addition the new manifesto now also includes tax cuts for medium-sized businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mädchen malen im gruppenraum der kindertagesstätte " landmäuse " im mecklenburgischen pokrent , während die jungen in der spielecke mit autos spielen -lrb- archivfoto vom 28.11.2003 -rrb- .

foto : jens büttner dpa + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + in an effort to tackle germany 's demographic problems , the spd plans to improve pre-school child care and is seeking to raise maternity leave benefits to near-wage levels .
the party also wants to solve a chronic cash shortage in the german public health service by broadening the basis of contributions to include for the first time civil servants and self-employed people . the social democrats vowed to leave the system of sector-wide collective bargaining for wages untouched , but said they were planning to introduce minimum wages in industries not covered by the system . a tax for the rich most controversial of all , however , are proposals to slap a 3-percent extra tax on incomes above 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 296,700 -rrb- a year .
they are a concession to the spd 's left fringe which had been on the verge of open revolt following the loss of the spd 's traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia in a regional election in may . now leftist social democrats like andrea nahles seem reconciled with schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein archivbild vom 10 .
november 1997 zeigt die spd-linke andrea nahles in bonn .
nahles hat den reformkurs von bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder erneut kritisiert , reformen grundsaetzlich aber befuerwortet .
" es waere fatal , jetzt zu sagen , wir sollten den ganzen reformprozess abbrechen " , sagte nahles am dienstag , 30 .
september 2003 , im zdf- " morgenmagazin " .
ihre kritik an schroeder sei der gegenwaertigen ausnahmesituation geschuldet .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- * * zu apd8819 * * " we do not take back the reforms of the past few years , but our campaign will have a new thrust , " she said .
" we say that domestic consumption in germany urgently needs a boost to be able to create jobs and economic growth .
chancellor schröder and the spd 's leftwing share this view so that the entire party stands united behind this manifesto . " come-back kid ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will schröder end up beating merkel after all ?
germans , however , seem to want political change .
currently they give the opposition christian democrats a commanding 18-point lead over the spd .
but after putting early elections on track by losing a confidence vote last friday , gerhard schröder appeared rejuvenated . at a weekend campaign appearance he urged cheering social democrats to ignore the polls and take confidence in another " come from behind " win as in 2002 . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election campaign starts , but hurdles remain the race towards early general elections in germany has begun in earnest , although many experts warn it is by no means certain that polls will take place in the autumn .
-lrb- july 3 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's not so gloomy economy suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts .
-lrb- july 5 , 2005 -rrb- what next for schröder 's government ?
when the german parliament defeated the confidence vote brought by chancellor gerhard schröder on friday , it set in motion a procedure designed to end in a general election in the fall .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 05.07.2005 spd presents election manifesto großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has " trust in germany , " but do germans trust the spd ?
germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .
the party 's leader said that the spd would wage its campaign under the motto " trust in germany . " in an attempt to win back traditional working class voters , germany 's social democrats have veered to the left in their election manifesto which includes higher taxes for the rich and minimum wages for the poor . but spd leader franz müntefering also said that the party leadership agreed to support gerhard schröder as the spd 's choice for chancellor and that the sweeping welfare cuts and labor market reforms known as agenda 2010 are here to stay . bildunterschrift : der spd-vorsitzende franz muentefering stellt auf einer pressekonferenz im willy-brandt-haus in berlin am montag , 4.juli 2005 , das wahlmanifest seiner partei fuer die geplante bundestagswahl im september vor .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- - german social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- chairman franz muentefering presents the party 's election program for the upcoming federal elections , on monday july 4 , 2005 in berlin .
word in background reads " germany " .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- " we want to shape german policies together with chancellor schröder over the next four years , " müntefering said .
" our prime focus for these years will be on employment , security and a life with dignity for all . " courting middle class voters with the reformist agenda 2010 platform , the social democrats are aiming at middle class voters who guaranteed the spd 's success in general elections in 1998 and 2002 .
in addition the new manifesto now also includes tax cuts for medium-sized businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mädchen malen im gruppenraum der kindertagesstätte " landmäuse " im mecklenburgischen pokrent , während die jungen in der spielecke mit autos spielen -lrb- archivfoto vom 28.11.2003 -rrb- .

the party also wants to solve a chronic cash shortage in the german public health service by broadening the basis of contributions to include for the first time civil servants and self-employed people . the social democrats vowed to leave the system of sector-wide collective bargaining for wages untouched , but said they were planning to introduce minimum wages in industries not covered by the system . a tax for the rich most controversial of all , however , are proposals to slap a 3-percent extra tax on incomes above 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 296,700 -rrb- a year .
they are a concession to the spd 's left fringe which had been on the verge of open revolt following the loss of the spd 's traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia in a regional election in may . now leftist social democrats like andrea nahles seem reconciled with schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein archivbild vom 10 .

nahles hat den reformkurs von bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder erneut kritisiert , reformen grundsaetzlich aber befuerwortet .
" es waere fatal , jetzt zu sagen , wir sollten den ganzen reformprozess abbrechen " , sagte nahles am dienstag , 30 .
september 2003 , im zdf- " morgenmagazin " .
ihre kritik an schroeder sei der gegenwaertigen ausnahmesituation geschuldet .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- * * zu apd8819 * * " we do not take back the reforms of the past few years , but our campaign will have a new thrust , " she said .
" we say that domestic consumption in germany urgently needs a boost to be able to create jobs and economic growth .
chancellor schröder and the spd 's leftwing share this view so that the entire party stands united behind this manifesto . " come-back kid ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will schröder end up beating merkel after all ?
germans , however , seem to want political change .
currently they give the opposition christian democrats a commanding 18-point lead over the spd .
but after putting early elections on track by losing a confidence vote last friday , gerhard schröder appeared rejuvenated . at a weekend campaign appearance he urged cheering social democrats to ignore the polls and take confidence in another " come from behind " win as in 2002 . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election campaign starts , but hurdles remain the race towards early general elections in germany has begun in earnest , although many experts warn it is by no means certain that polls will take place in the autumn .
-lrb- july 3 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's not so gloomy economy suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts .

the city 's tourism head had also voiced his concern that removal would not help the city as thousands of tourists visited the site each day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the removal was reminiscent of 1989 but the city 's government , which consists of social democrats and the party of democratic socialism , the successor party to the former east german communist party , never saw the privately organized memorial as part of berlin 's concept to remember the wall . city officials plan to build a cold war museum near the site while an official wall memorial already exists on berlin 's bernauerstrasse . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin wall memorial faces final fury a controversial berlin wall memorial near the famed checkpoint charlie museum is set to be razed .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .

opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .
damage to pipelines or supply facilities can quickly lead to shortages and price hikes . no threat yet there 's no threat to international supply yet .
but most countries are pumping to capacity , leaving little room to maneuver .
opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .
german weekly wirtschaftswoche claimed that volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg , " and that more resignations - including that of vw 's head of personnel and overseer of the german government 's economic reforms , peter hartz - would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz so far , hartz has the full backing of vw 's supervisory board .
and even german chancellor gerhard schröder lauded hartz 's " innovative " achievements on tuesday , while insisting he would not allow himself to be drawn into what were ultimately vw 's internal affairs . role of unions under scrutiny the scandal at volkswagen has sparked a much wider debate about the overall power of the unions , already battling a decline in grassroots support in germany . some observers suggest management could try to use the affair to loosen the union grip on europe 's biggest carmaker and push through anti-union reforms . while the full scale of the bribe-taking scandal is still far from clear , it does appear that the affair is a product of the intricate network of power connections and interdependencies between politicians , management and unions that sets vw apart from other german companies . a top politician from the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , saw the events at vw as symptomatic of the shortcomings of the german system whereby both shareholders and employee representatives hold a similar number of seats on the supervisory board . volkert 's successor , bernd osterloh , lashed back at such attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall flags wave in front of a vw production facility " there are forces that are trying to weaken employees ' representation within vw , where the strength of the works council and of the ig metall union has long been a thorn in the flesh to them , " osterloh was quoted by the business daily handelsblatt as saying in a letter to shareholders . osterloh warned against allowing the solidarity between the works council , ig metall and the unions from being destroyed either from the inside or the outside . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 eu gives lufthansa-swiss merger go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airlines will have to scale back in several european airports german carrier lufthansa and swiss international air lines are set to merge after the european commission on tuesday approved lufthansa 's acquisition of swiss , in a further consolidation of european airlines . but the commission said that the purchase was dependent on the parties surrendering take-off and landing slots , in particular at zurich and frankfurt airports , and other concessions . " in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the commitments given by lufthansa ensure that competitors will be able to offer new services in competition with the merged company . " " this is a partnership for all our customers , " said wolfgang mayrhuber , chairman and ceo of lufthansa , in a statement .
" in just a few weeks time , the customers of our two airlines will be feeling the first benefits that our partnership will bring . " for his part , christoph franz , ceo and president of swiss said " the green light from brussels and washington gives us the opportunity to ensure the long-term future of the air transport connections that are so crucial to switzerland and its economy . " lufthansa quickly changed the home page of its aviation group internet site displaying pictures of lufthansa and swiss employees , the tailfins of the two companies and the words " grüezi mitenand -lrb- ' hello to all of you ' in swiss german dialect -rrb- and welcome aboard . " field open for competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa at frankfurt airport apart from zurich and frankfurt , the eu commission said the parties had agreed to surrender slots at munich , düsseldorf , berlin , vienna , stockholm and copenhagen , making 41 round trips per day potentially available to competitors .
lufthansa is also barred from offering more flights on the affected routes so that any new entrant would have a fair chance to establish itself as a credible competitor . lufthansa said the decision to give up the slots at several european airports would not significantly change its competitive position or hit its earnings .
" it will not greatly impact on our competitive position , " a spokeswoman said and added that the company is still maintaining its full-year profit targets . lufthansa said previously that it expects operating profit for 2005 to be on a par with the 383 million euros it recorded last year . lufthansa group last year had revenue of nearly 17 billion euros , with its more than 90,000 staff members transporting 50.9 million passengers and 1.75 million tons of cargo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .
german weekly wirtschaftswoche claimed that volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg , " and that more resignations - including that of vw 's head of personnel and overseer of the german government 's economic reforms , peter hartz - would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz so far , hartz has the full backing of vw 's supervisory board .
and even german chancellor gerhard schröder lauded hartz 's " innovative " achievements on tuesday , while insisting he would not allow himself to be drawn into what were ultimately vw 's internal affairs . role of unions under scrutiny the scandal at volkswagen has sparked a much wider debate about the overall power of the unions , already battling a decline in grassroots support in germany . some observers suggest management could try to use the affair to loosen the union grip on europe 's biggest carmaker and push through anti-union reforms . while the full scale of the bribe-taking scandal is still far from clear , it does appear that the affair is a product of the intricate network of power connections and interdependencies between politicians , management and unions that sets vw apart from other german companies . a top politician from the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , saw the events at vw as symptomatic of the shortcomings of the german system whereby both shareholders and employee representatives hold a similar number of seats on the supervisory board . volkert 's successor , bernd osterloh , lashed back at such attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall flags wave in front of a vw production facility " there are forces that are trying to weaken employees ' representation within vw , where the strength of the works council and of the ig metall union has long been a thorn in the flesh to them , " osterloh was quoted by the business daily handelsblatt as saying in a letter to shareholders . osterloh warned against allowing the solidarity between the works council , ig metall and the unions from being destroyed either from the inside or the outside . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .
-lrb- july 1 , 2005 -rrb- eu takes germany to court over vw law the european commission decided wednesday to take germany to the european court of justice for not having modified its so-called volkswagen law , which shields the carmaker from hostile takeovers , an eu source said .

singapore time will give a clue to the billion-dollar question of which city will host the 2012 olympic games . just 24 hours before the announcement , the frenzy has caused people to consult lip-reading experts to get a split-second advantage over others in terms of knowing where the world 's athletes will gather seven years from now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tight-lipped rogge would point to paris should rogge close his lips after the phrase " and the host city is , " paris will party , francois grosjean , a professor of psycholionguistics at the university of neuchatel in switzerland , told afp .
if the mouth stays open , it 's london 's lucky day . clear front-runners while madrid , moscow and new york are also still in the running , insiders have said that most ioc members have lined up behind the british and french capitals - a rumor confirmed by german ioc member walter tröger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner with the logo of paris ' olympic bid " there are favorites in the opinion of my colleagues , " he said .
" paris and london are definitely at the front , but everything 's possible .
paris clearly has a chance , because its bid is a good one and because it 's probably time for paris again .
but that 's purely speculative . " the british prime minister did n't seem to take any chances and arrived at the ioc meeting place in singapore monday for an intense two-day lobbying effort in support of london 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium dome in london 's greenwich , wednesday , may 29 , 2002 .

-lrb- ap photo / richard lewis -rrb- " the spirit of london 2012 will be the best of the spirit of the olympic movement , " said blair , who met with dozens of ioc members in private talks .
" we will build something that does n't just last for the few weeks of the games , but lasts for a generation to come . " british food blair refused to comment on remarks by french president jacques chirac , who had reportedly labeled british food the worst in europe apart from that of finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has probably never tasted blair 's food " you ca n't trust people who have such lousy cooking , " chirac had said during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin in kaliningrad on sunday , according to french newspaper liberation . blair countered that he did n't want to get " tempted down that path " of returning in kind , saying that olympic competitors should approach the race with " the right diplomatic spirit . " his view was obviously not shared by british tabloid the sun , whose editors denounced chirac as a " nasty , petty racist creep " and someone who " has lost his marbles " on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees in paris on april 5 , 2004 another paper hoped britain 's queen elizabeth ii would serve chirac beans on toast - " on his head " - when he attends a dinner party hosted by her in scotland wednesday to welcome g8 leaders for their summit . " i may be staying in singapore for the rest of the week now , " blair told reporters jokingly when asked whether the bickering between paris and london would cloud his meeting with chirac in scotland . france 's stadium but the british team also took a jibe at paris , indirectly calling the city 's stade de france stadium unsuitable for the olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for the 1998 soccer world cup , the stade de france seemed to be doing pretty well when it hosted the world athletics championships in 2003 " the one thing you do have with an existing stadium is that it has been built for -lrb- soccer -rrb- , it has n't been built for athletics , " said jim sloman , the chief operating officer for the sydney 2000 games and now an advisor to the london bid . the remark , which some saw as violating ioc rules that bidders are not allowed to criticize each other , caused paris mayor bertrand delanoe to accuse his rivals of unfairness . " i think that to deserve victory you have to respect the olympic spirit and demonstrate fair play , " he said . only time and rogge 's lips will tell . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain , france lock horns over budget not since britain 's joining of the us-led invasion of iraq has the country seemed so isolated in the eu as tony blair remains at loggerheads with france and germany over eu spending plans ahead of a crucial summit .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .

lufthansa is also barred from offering more flights on the affected routes so that any new entrant would have a fair chance to establish itself as a credible competitor . lufthansa said the decision to give up the slots at several european airports would not significantly change its competitive position or hit its earnings .
" it will not greatly impact on our competitive position , " a spokeswoman said and added that the company is still maintaining its full-year profit targets . lufthansa said previously that it expects operating profit for 2005 to be on a par with the 383 million euros it recorded last year . lufthansa group last year had revenue of nearly 17 billion euros , with its more than 90,000 staff members transporting 50.9 million passengers and 1.75 million tons of cargo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .

the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 eu gives lufthansa-swiss merger go-ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airlines will have to scale back in several european airports german carrier lufthansa and swiss international air lines are set to merge after the european commission on tuesday approved lufthansa 's acquisition of swiss , in a further consolidation of european airlines . but the commission said that the purchase was dependent on the parties surrendering take-off and landing slots , in particular at zurich and frankfurt airports , and other concessions . " in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the commitments given by lufthansa ensure that competitors will be able to offer new services in competition with the merged company . " " this is a partnership for all our customers , " said wolfgang mayrhuber , chairman and ceo of lufthansa , in a statement .
" in just a few weeks time , the customers of our two airlines will be feeling the first benefits that our partnership will bring . " for his part , christoph franz , ceo and president of swiss said " the green light from brussels and washington gives us the opportunity to ensure the long-term future of the air transport connections that are so crucial to switzerland and its economy . " lufthansa quickly changed the home page of its aviation group internet site displaying pictures of lufthansa and swiss employees , the tailfins of the two companies and the words " grüezi mitenand -lrb- ' hello to all of you ' in swiss german dialect -rrb- and welcome aboard . " field open for competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa at frankfurt airport apart from zurich and frankfurt , the eu commission said the parties had agreed to surrender slots at munich , düsseldorf , berlin , vienna , stockholm and copenhagen , making 41 round trips per day potentially available to competitors .
lufthansa is also barred from offering more flights on the affected routes so that any new entrant would have a fair chance to establish itself as a credible competitor . lufthansa said the decision to give up the slots at several european airports would not significantly change its competitive position or hit its earnings .
" it will not greatly impact on our competitive position , " a spokeswoman said and added that the company is still maintaining its full-year profit targets . lufthansa said previously that it expects operating profit for 2005 to be on a par with the 383 million euros it recorded last year . lufthansa group last year had revenue of nearly 17 billion euros , with its more than 90,000 staff members transporting 50.9 million passengers and 1.75 million tons of cargo .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the commitments given by lufthansa ensure that competitors will be able to offer new services in competition with the merged company . " " this is a partnership for all our customers , " said wolfgang mayrhuber , chairman and ceo of lufthansa , in a statement .
" in just a few weeks time , the customers of our two airlines will be feeling the first benefits that our partnership will bring . " for his part , christoph franz , ceo and president of swiss said " the green light from brussels and washington gives us the opportunity to ensure the long-term future of the air transport connections that are so crucial to switzerland and its economy . " lufthansa quickly changed the home page of its aviation group internet site displaying pictures of lufthansa and swiss employees , the tailfins of the two companies and the words " grüezi mitenand -lrb- ' hello to all of you ' in swiss german dialect -rrb- and welcome aboard .

lufthansa is also barred from offering more flights on the affected routes so that any new entrant would have a fair chance to establish itself as a credible competitor . lufthansa said the decision to give up the slots at several european airports would not significantly change its competitive position or hit its earnings .
" it will not greatly impact on our competitive position , " a spokeswoman said and added that the company is still maintaining its full-year profit targets . lufthansa said previously that it expects operating profit for 2005 to be on a par with the 383 million euros it recorded last year . lufthansa group last year had revenue of nearly 17 billion euros , with its more than 90,000 staff members transporting 50.9 million passengers and 1.75 million tons of cargo .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .
damage to pipelines or supply facilities can quickly lead to shortages and price hikes . no threat yet there 's no threat to international supply yet .
but most countries are pumping to capacity , leaving little room to maneuver .
opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .
with early elections likely in the autumn , he wants to be seen doing something about high oil prices now even if he has little leverage against supplier countries like saudi arabia , say experts . florian nusch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .
damage to pipelines or supply facilities can quickly lead to shortages and price hikes . no threat yet there 's no threat to international supply yet .
but most countries are pumping to capacity , leaving little room to maneuver .
opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .
with early elections likely in the autumn , he wants to be seen doing something about high oil prices now even if he has little leverage against supplier countries like saudi arabia , say experts . florian nusch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .
leaders will arrive at the gleneagles venue in scotland throughout the day on wednesday before dining with queen elizabeth .
on thursday , the g8 will invite its counterparts from brazil , china , india and others for talks on climate change , while african issues will top the agenda on friday . robert mudge -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin live 8 concert attracts over 200,000 more than 200,000 spectators attended berlin 's live 8 concert .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .

suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts . " currently there 's a tendency to be pessimistic in germany , " the government 's economic advisory council wrote in its last annual report .
but despite bleak growth outlooks , the situation in germany apparently is n't quite as desolate as commonly thought . for example , real wages in germany dropped by 0.9 percent over the last few years while they rose by 7.4 percent on average in the 15 old eu states , according to a report by the institute for economic and social sciences of the hans böckler foundation -lrb- wsi -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's apparently not getting too much money though that may sound bleak for wage-earners , it 's good for business , and the reason why germany leads the world in terms of exports , according to wsi 's thorsten schulten .
he added that a sound export market is also a good indicator for international competitiveness . " as these numbers show , it makes no sense to say that germany 's trade unions have too much power or that wages are too high , " he said . apples and oranges comparing germany to countries with lower wages such as poland and the czech republic is also futile , according to rolf kroker of german economic institute in cologne -lrb- iw -rrb- . productivity is much higher in germany , which can also rely on well-trained and well-qualified workers despite talk about the country 's faltering educational system , kroker added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german researchers are doing well " we 're really doing well in the field of mathematics and natural sciences as well as engineering , " he said , adding that germany 's ageing population will create problems in the long run . foreign investors do notice the current advantages of setting up shop in germany .
according to a report by ernst & young , the country takes the no. 5 spot - behind china , the us , india and poland - in a global ranking of favorite places to do business .
germany got best grades for research in development in the survey . awash with innovation with 23,000 new registrations at the european patent office , germans came in third behind the us and japan last year .
most entries came from the country 's automotive , electronic , machine construction , medical and environmental technology sectors .
in terms of the government 's support for innovation , germany comes in at the european average with 2.5 percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state 's still taking too much money from companies , according to some the area where changes are most needed is the country 's fiscal policies : german corporate taxes can not compete internationally , but the government 's reform plans have been put on hold because of likely early elections in the fall . " that 's the first thing the new government needs to deal with , " kroker said . bad bureaucracy bureaucracy is another problem . " the high degree of regulation , an inflexible labor market and high social standards all deter investors , " ernst & young 's peter englisch said , adding that other countries such as china , india and the eastern european states were benefiting from this . but access to financial investors , a good infrastructure and germany 's central location within europe were big advantages , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future 's bright ?
kroker also listed the country 's rule of law and political stability as further positive factors . " you should n't underestimate the importance of a functioning society : germany 's might be complex , but it is n't corrupt , " he added .
" that creates reliability . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .
damage to pipelines or supply facilities can quickly lead to shortages and price hikes . no threat yet there 's no threat to international supply yet .
but most countries are pumping to capacity , leaving little room to maneuver .
opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .
with early elections likely in the autumn , he wants to be seen doing something about high oil prices now even if he has little leverage against supplier countries like saudi arabia , say experts . florian nusch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

small tech companies , however , want patents to cover only the invention running the program , allowing the idea and the functionality of the software to be used by others . until now , only the underlying programming code has been subject to copyright in europe .
that means that programmers could not reuse the code from other copyrighted software products , but could easily write their own code , which would imitate or improve the functionality of other programs . licensing ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer running linux , a free-source operating system the prospect of patents covering the underlying programming code is particularly worrying to backers of the so-called ' open source ' movement , who are staunch supporters of the free exchange of ideas in software development . the proposed eu bill would be similar to the us model of providing patent protection to software products .
of the 17,000 software patents , which are registered in the states each year , more than 3,000 are owned by the computer giant microsoft . the online reseller amazon , for example , holds a patent to the so-called " 1-click " checkout system , which enables users to shop online without repeatedly having to enter their passwords or credit card information .
because the 1-click-purchase is a patented technology , amazon is entitled to impose licensing fees to anybody who wants to implement such a system on their website . protecting or stifling the software industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the european patent office opponents of the software patents believe that legal restrictions of this kind will increase the number of trivial patents , stifle creativity and harm the information technology industry in the long run . " an agreement among all actors that software should not be patented , so providing an unequivocal definition in the directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- that guarantees this is clearly in the general interest , " said hans-werner müller , head of the ueapme association representing small companies . " the cacophony of misinformation and misleading spin from the large industry lobby in the run up to this vote has obscured the general consensus on preventing the patenting of pure software , " he added . the wind , however , appears to be blowing in favor of the big groups after a parliamentary committee rejected last month proposed amendments to the bill which would have restricted patents to the invention underlying a computer program . those in favor of patents for programs , on the other hand , acknowledge that victory is not a foregone conclusion . " the game is not over .
the defeated amendments could find a second wind on the 6th of july , " said former parliament president pat cox . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu deadline for microsoft expires the european union on wednesday began studying proposals from microsoft to end an antitrust row that has seen the us software giant threatened with heavy fines .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .

but as affordable foreign cars offer consumers an attractive alternative , how long will this still be the case ? stroll down a german street these days and it becomes clear that car-buying habits - just like population trends - are edging toward the multicultural .
nestled among the mercedes , bmws and volkswagens are numerous toyotas , renaults and hyundais .
the german association of motor vehicle importers -lrb- vdik -rrb- reports that the market share for foreign carmakers in germany is around 35 percent , with a slight increase in new registrations predicted for 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw logos - still covetable are germans suddenly less interested in buying german cars ?
could it be that premium brands such as mercedes benz are losing their shine ?
not necessarily .
" the situation has changed a bit , " peter brietsche of the german market research institute gfk group said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" mercedes was always a dream that we grew up with .
it symbolizes a car that 's big , safe and has cachet .
it 's the car your boss drives .
being able to buy such a car was a sign that you 'd made it . "
that still holds true in germany , despite the fact that mercedes ' image has taken a bashing following daimler benz 's disappointing merger with us carmaker chrysler and a series of embarrassing technical and quality problems , brietsche said .
" we remember how the a-class rolled over while swerving during the so-called ' elk test , ' or how there were quality problems with the m-class at the beginning , " said brietsche .
" despite the technical problems , the image of the brand wins out in the end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in a mercedes is easy in germany - just take a taxi his theory is validated on the street .
taxi driver jens kretschmer spends a lot of time in his mercedes , and says he would never even consider a foreign car .
" not for a taxi , at least , " he said .
" german cars have a much longer life , they 're more reliable . "
when asked if reports about the quality problems at mercedes had changed his view at all , he simply shrugged .
" foreign cars have problems , too , " he said .
price point but foreign cars tend to be much cheaper than german cars .
tough economic times and a general trend towards thriftiness have made foreign cars more appealing - something that has not escaped foreign importers ' notice .
their target group ?
cost-conscious private consumers .
" germans still prefer to buy german quality , " brietsche said .
" but these days , people are prepared to make compromises .
it 's that sense of rationality that is opening the door for other brands . "
in order to compete , german carmakers find themselves entering the kind of price wars typically seen in the united states .
now , it 's not uncommon to get a discount of up to 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- on a new german car .
customers feel less bound to a particular brand than they did in the past , and are eager to reap the benefits of shopping around .
corporate equals german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor leonardo dicaprio might think it 's cool to drive a toyota prius , but in germany , he 'd get more mileage out of a benz still , not everyone can afford to follow their wallet when choosing a vehicle .
in most societies , clothes make the man .
in germany , clothes - while important - are secondary to the car you drive .
the business executive who pulls into his reserved company parking spot in a lexus , for example , is bound to attract questioning stares .
markus h. is a salesman who , due to the nature of his job , spends a lot of time in his car - an audi .
while personally interested in toyota 's hybrid car , the prius , he knew that would n't jive with the image his company was trying to present .
" you have to bear in mind what your customers might think if you pull up outside their business in a foreign car , " he said .
" some of them might think you 're not earning enough to be able to afford a quality german car , and that reflects badly on your employer . "
the pull of a shiny new benz or bmw is still strong enough in germany to have firmly planted itself in the minds of the country 's immigrant communities .
reza , an iranian who works part-time as a taxi driver , has gotten used to the comfort and road-handling of the mercedes he drives while on the job .
privately , he does n't yet own a car , but when asked what he would buy given the choice , he does n't even have to think about it : " a mercedes , " he says with a smile .
in germany 's turkish community , it 's not uncommon for four or five young men to pool their savings in order to buy a single mercedes or bmw which they then have to share , rather than to each individually purchase a foreign car they could call their own .
but then , ford fiestas tend not to turn quite so many heads when cruising the main drag , bass booming , on a saturday night . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers optimistic about china some german carmakers showing their wares at the auto shanghai 2005 motor show are hoping flashy presentations and new models will boost sales .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .
leaders will arrive at the gleneagles venue in scotland throughout the day on wednesday before dining with queen elizabeth .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .
leaders will arrive at the gleneagles venue in scotland throughout the day on wednesday before dining with queen elizabeth .

singapore time will give a clue to the billion-dollar question of which city will host the 2012 olympic games . just 24 hours before the announcement , the frenzy has caused people to consult lip-reading experts to get a split-second advantage over others in terms of knowing where the world 's athletes will gather seven years from now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tight-lipped rogge would point to paris should rogge close his lips after the phrase " and the host city is , " paris will party , francois grosjean , a professor of psycholionguistics at the university of neuchatel in switzerland , told afp .
if the mouth stays open , it 's london 's lucky day . clear front-runners while madrid , moscow and new york are also still in the running , insiders have said that most ioc members have lined up behind the british and french capitals - a rumor confirmed by german ioc member walter tröger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner with the logo of paris ' olympic bid " there are favorites in the opinion of my colleagues , " he said .
" paris and london are definitely at the front , but everything 's possible .
paris clearly has a chance , because its bid is a good one and because it 's probably time for paris again .
but that 's purely speculative . " the british prime minister did n't seem to take any chances and arrived at the ioc meeting place in singapore monday for an intense two-day lobbying effort in support of london 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium dome in london 's greenwich , wednesday , may 29 , 2002 .
dome minister lord falconer made a statment to the house of lords in which he announced that the building will be taken over by the meridian delta consortium for nothing .
they will be turning the structure into a 20,000 seat arena for sports and concerts .
-lrb- ap photo / richard lewis -rrb- " the spirit of london 2012 will be the best of the spirit of the olympic movement , " said blair , who met with dozens of ioc members in private talks .
" we will build something that does n't just last for the few weeks of the games , but lasts for a generation to come . " british food blair refused to comment on remarks by french president jacques chirac , who had reportedly labeled british food the worst in europe apart from that of finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has probably never tasted blair 's food " you ca n't trust people who have such lousy cooking , " chirac had said during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin in kaliningrad on sunday , according to french newspaper liberation . blair countered that he did n't want to get " tempted down that path " of returning in kind , saying that olympic competitors should approach the race with " the right diplomatic spirit . " his view was obviously not shared by british tabloid the sun , whose editors denounced chirac as a " nasty , petty racist creep " and someone who " has lost his marbles " on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees in paris on april 5 , 2004 another paper hoped britain 's queen elizabeth ii would serve chirac beans on toast - " on his head " - when he attends a dinner party hosted by her in scotland wednesday to welcome g8 leaders for their summit .

the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .

lufthansa is also barred from offering more flights on the affected routes so that any new entrant would have a fair chance to establish itself as a credible competitor . lufthansa said the decision to give up the slots at several european airports would not significantly change its competitive position or hit its earnings .
" it will not greatly impact on our competitive position , " a spokeswoman said and added that the company is still maintaining its full-year profit targets . lufthansa said previously that it expects operating profit for 2005 to be on a par with the 383 million euros it recorded last year . lufthansa group last year had revenue of nearly 17 billion euros , with its more than 90,000 staff members transporting 50.9 million passengers and 1.75 million tons of cargo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 germany 's not so gloomy economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time for germans to smile again ?
suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts . " currently there 's a tendency to be pessimistic in germany , " the government 's economic advisory council wrote in its last annual report .
but despite bleak growth outlooks , the situation in germany apparently is n't quite as desolate as commonly thought . for example , real wages in germany dropped by 0.9 percent over the last few years while they rose by 7.4 percent on average in the 15 old eu states , according to a report by the institute for economic and social sciences of the hans böckler foundation -lrb- wsi -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's apparently not getting too much money though that may sound bleak for wage-earners , it 's good for business , and the reason why germany leads the world in terms of exports , according to wsi 's thorsten schulten .
he added that a sound export market is also a good indicator for international competitiveness . " as these numbers show , it makes no sense to say that germany 's trade unions have too much power or that wages are too high , " he said . apples and oranges comparing germany to countries with lower wages such as poland and the czech republic is also futile , according to rolf kroker of german economic institute in cologne -lrb- iw -rrb- . productivity is much higher in germany , which can also rely on well-trained and well-qualified workers despite talk about the country 's faltering educational system , kroker added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german researchers are doing well " we 're really doing well in the field of mathematics and natural sciences as well as engineering , " he said , adding that germany 's ageing population will create problems in the long run . foreign investors do notice the current advantages of setting up shop in germany .
according to a report by ernst & young , the country takes the no. 5 spot - behind china , the us , india and poland - in a global ranking of favorite places to do business .
germany got best grades for research in development in the survey . awash with innovation with 23,000 new registrations at the european patent office , germans came in third behind the us and japan last year .
most entries came from the country 's automotive , electronic , machine construction , medical and environmental technology sectors .
in terms of the government 's support for innovation , germany comes in at the european average with 2.5 percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state 's still taking too much money from companies , according to some the area where changes are most needed is the country 's fiscal policies : german corporate taxes can not compete internationally , but the government 's reform plans have been put on hold because of likely early elections in the fall . " that 's the first thing the new government needs to deal with , " kroker said . bad bureaucracy bureaucracy is another problem . " the high degree of regulation , an inflexible labor market and high social standards all deter investors , " ernst & young 's peter englisch said , adding that other countries such as china , india and the eastern european states were benefiting from this . but access to financial investors , a good infrastructure and germany 's central location within europe were big advantages , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future 's bright ?
kroker also listed the country 's rule of law and political stability as further positive factors . " you should n't underestimate the importance of a functioning society : germany 's might be complex , but it is n't corrupt , " he added .
" that creates reliability . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- gloomy news again for german economy instead of building on last year 's recovery , the german economy appears to be heading downhill again .
on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 .

vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .

suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts . " currently there 's a tendency to be pessimistic in germany , " the government 's economic advisory council wrote in its last annual report .
but despite bleak growth outlooks , the situation in germany apparently is n't quite as desolate as commonly thought . for example , real wages in germany dropped by 0.9 percent over the last few years while they rose by 7.4 percent on average in the 15 old eu states , according to a report by the institute for economic and social sciences of the hans böckler foundation -lrb- wsi -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's apparently not getting too much money though that may sound bleak for wage-earners , it 's good for business , and the reason why germany leads the world in terms of exports , according to wsi 's thorsten schulten .
he added that a sound export market is also a good indicator for international competitiveness . " as these numbers show , it makes no sense to say that germany 's trade unions have too much power or that wages are too high , " he said . apples and oranges comparing germany to countries with lower wages such as poland and the czech republic is also futile , according to rolf kroker of german economic institute in cologne -lrb- iw -rrb- . productivity is much higher in germany , which can also rely on well-trained and well-qualified workers despite talk about the country 's faltering educational system , kroker added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german researchers are doing well " we 're really doing well in the field of mathematics and natural sciences as well as engineering , " he said , adding that germany 's ageing population will create problems in the long run . foreign investors do notice the current advantages of setting up shop in germany .
according to a report by ernst & young , the country takes the no. 5 spot - behind china , the us , india and poland - in a global ranking of favorite places to do business .
germany got best grades for research in development in the survey . awash with innovation with 23,000 new registrations at the european patent office , germans came in third behind the us and japan last year .
most entries came from the country 's automotive , electronic , machine construction , medical and environmental technology sectors .
in terms of the government 's support for innovation , germany comes in at the european average with 2.5 percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state 's still taking too much money from companies , according to some the area where changes are most needed is the country 's fiscal policies : german corporate taxes can not compete internationally , but the government 's reform plans have been put on hold because of likely early elections in the fall . " that 's the first thing the new government needs to deal with , " kroker said . bad bureaucracy bureaucracy is another problem . " the high degree of regulation , an inflexible labor market and high social standards all deter investors , " ernst & young 's peter englisch said , adding that other countries such as china , india and the eastern european states were benefiting from this . but access to financial investors , a good infrastructure and germany 's central location within europe were big advantages , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future 's bright ?
kroker also listed the country 's rule of law and political stability as further positive factors . " you should n't underestimate the importance of a functioning society : germany 's might be complex , but it is n't corrupt , " he added .
" that creates reliability . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .

singapore time will give a clue to the billion-dollar question of which city will host the 2012 olympic games . just 24 hours before the announcement , the frenzy has caused people to consult lip-reading experts to get a split-second advantage over others in terms of knowing where the world 's athletes will gather seven years from now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tight-lipped rogge would point to paris should rogge close his lips after the phrase " and the host city is , " paris will party , francois grosjean , a professor of psycholionguistics at the university of neuchatel in switzerland , told afp .
if the mouth stays open , it 's london 's lucky day . clear front-runners while madrid , moscow and new york are also still in the running , insiders have said that most ioc members have lined up behind the british and french capitals - a rumor confirmed by german ioc member walter tröger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner with the logo of paris ' olympic bid " there are favorites in the opinion of my colleagues , " he said .
" paris and london are definitely at the front , but everything 's possible .
paris clearly has a chance , because its bid is a good one and because it 's probably time for paris again .
but that 's purely speculative . " the british prime minister did n't seem to take any chances and arrived at the ioc meeting place in singapore monday for an intense two-day lobbying effort in support of london 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium dome in london 's greenwich , wednesday , may 29 , 2002 .
dome minister lord falconer made a statment to the house of lords in which he announced that the building will be taken over by the meridian delta consortium for nothing .
they will be turning the structure into a 20,000 seat arena for sports and concerts .
-lrb- ap photo / richard lewis -rrb- " the spirit of london 2012 will be the best of the spirit of the olympic movement , " said blair , who met with dozens of ioc members in private talks .
" we will build something that does n't just last for the few weeks of the games , but lasts for a generation to come . " british food blair refused to comment on remarks by french president jacques chirac , who had reportedly labeled british food the worst in europe apart from that of finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has probably never tasted blair 's food " you ca n't trust people who have such lousy cooking , " chirac had said during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin in kaliningrad on sunday , according to french newspaper liberation . blair countered that he did n't want to get " tempted down that path " of returning in kind , saying that olympic competitors should approach the race with " the right diplomatic spirit . " his view was obviously not shared by british tabloid the sun , whose editors denounced chirac as a " nasty , petty racist creep " and someone who " has lost his marbles " on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees in paris on april 5 , 2004 another paper hoped britain 's queen elizabeth ii would serve chirac beans on toast - " on his head " - when he attends a dinner party hosted by her in scotland wednesday to welcome g8 leaders for their summit . " i may be staying in singapore for the rest of the week now , " blair told reporters jokingly when asked whether the bickering between paris and london would cloud his meeting with chirac in scotland . france 's stadium but the british team also took a jibe at paris , indirectly calling the city 's stade de france stadium unsuitable for the olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for the 1998 soccer world cup , the stade de france seemed to be doing pretty well when it hosted the world athletics championships in 2003 " the one thing you do have with an existing stadium is that it has been built for -lrb- soccer -rrb- , it has n't been built for athletics , " said jim sloman , the chief operating officer for the sydney 2000 games and now an advisor to the london bid . the remark , which some saw as violating ioc rules that bidders are not allowed to criticize each other , caused paris mayor bertrand delanoe to accuse his rivals of unfairness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2005 schröder takes on oil speculators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is not the only factor keeping oil prices high record oil prices are worrying politicians , who fear they could throttle economic growth .
in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .
damage to pipelines or supply facilities can quickly lead to shortages and price hikes . no threat yet there 's no threat to international supply yet .
but most countries are pumping to capacity , leaving little room to maneuver .
opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .
with early elections likely in the autumn , he wants to be seen doing something about high oil prices now even if he has little leverage against supplier countries like saudi arabia , say experts . florian nusch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2005 schröder takes on oil speculators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is not the only factor keeping oil prices high record oil prices are worrying politicians , who fear they could throttle economic growth .
in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .
damage to pipelines or supply facilities can quickly lead to shortages and price hikes . no threat yet there 's no threat to international supply yet .
but most countries are pumping to capacity , leaving little room to maneuver .
opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .
with early elections likely in the autumn , he wants to be seen doing something about high oil prices now even if he has little leverage against supplier countries like saudi arabia , say experts . florian nusch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .

analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .

he faces charges of computer sabotage , data manipulation and disruption of public systems . the spokeswoman for the tribunal hearing sven jaschan 's trial said the 19-year-old admitted during the first day of the closed-door hearing to having unleashed the destructive program in the spring of 2004 . the sasser worm didn ’ t require users to receive an email or open a file to be infected - just having a vulnerable windows machine connected to the internet was enough . the it departments of many organizations were caught unawares , and the worm spread further .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers shut down .
in the united states , delta airlines was forced to cancel several flights . in the german city of hanover , staff at the postbank took a step back in time and recorded transactions on paper .
and in seattle , microsoft promised a reward of $ 250,000 -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- for information leading to the responsible hacker . they left their doors wide open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windows open to the word -lrb- and viruses , too -rrb- by exploiting a known hole in the local security component of windows operating system , the worm spread quickly , infecting hundreds of thousands of computers in just a few days , overloading processors and forcing systems into an unstoppable pattern of shutting down , then rebooting .
it apparently did no lasting harm . microsoft had issued a security bulletin and a patch to correct the problem two weeks earlier , but only the companies and individuals who installed the update were protected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house in which sasser was born : it 's estimated that the economic cost of the sasser worm attack ran into millions of dollars , and it was all caused by jaschan , a then 18-year-old school student working from his basement in the small north german village of waffensen . attracted by the reward , two of the hacker ’ s schoolmates tipped off microsoft , who then informed the police . a job instead of jail seven days after the worm was released , police arrested the hacker and seized his computer as evidence .
after confessing , the youth was released , and within five months was employed as an it trainee at securepoint , a german software security company .
but now it ’ s time for the young man to face the music - more or less . german public prosecutors have put the youth on trial for damages of 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 155,000 -rrb- , an amount some argue doesn ’ t reflect the scale of the crime at all . but it ’ s all prosecutors can do .
any party wanting to sue for damages needs to file a civil lawsuit against the alleged perpetrator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers often host uninvited guests though 143 claims have been made - not surprisingly - very few large , publicly-listed companies are willing to admit their systems were defeated by a lone teenager using publicly available information . he 's just a kid if the hacker had been an adult , the court could sentence him to a fine or up to five years imprisonment .
but as a juvenile , he ’ s likely to receive a much more lenient sentence . jaschan was known as a mild-mannered and friendly teenager , a spokeswoman for the court in the northern city of verden said . " the court must hand down a sentence that can have an educational effect on the young man . " defense lawyer jens möwe says his client has learned his lesson and won ’ t re-offend .
he expects the trial to be over within three days . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world class computer worms a german teenager created some of the most harmful worms to hit computers around the world during the first half of 2004 , according to experts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.07.2005 paris , london bicker over olympic bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " one more word about british food and you 'll sleep hungry in scotland " as members of the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- prepare to announce their choice for the 2012 host city wednesday , backers for front-runners paris and london have begun to take shots at each other . slightly open or pressed together tightly : the state of ioc president jacques rogge 's lips on wednesday around 8 p.m.
singapore time will give a clue to the billion-dollar question of which city will host the 2012 olympic games . just 24 hours before the announcement , the frenzy has caused people to consult lip-reading experts to get a split-second advantage over others in terms of knowing where the world 's athletes will gather seven years from now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tight-lipped rogge would point to paris should rogge close his lips after the phrase " and the host city is , " paris will party , francois grosjean , a professor of psycholionguistics at the university of neuchatel in switzerland , told afp .
if the mouth stays open , it 's london 's lucky day . clear front-runners while madrid , moscow and new york are also still in the running , insiders have said that most ioc members have lined up behind the british and french capitals - a rumor confirmed by german ioc member walter tröger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner with the logo of paris ' olympic bid " there are favorites in the opinion of my colleagues , " he said .
" paris and london are definitely at the front , but everything 's possible .
paris clearly has a chance , because its bid is a good one and because it 's probably time for paris again .
but that 's purely speculative . " the british prime minister did n't seem to take any chances and arrived at the ioc meeting place in singapore monday for an intense two-day lobbying effort in support of london 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium dome in london 's greenwich , wednesday , may 29 , 2002 .
dome minister lord falconer made a statment to the house of lords in which he announced that the building will be taken over by the meridian delta consortium for nothing .

-lrb- ap photo / richard lewis -rrb- " the spirit of london 2012 will be the best of the spirit of the olympic movement , " said blair , who met with dozens of ioc members in private talks .
" we will build something that does n't just last for the few weeks of the games , but lasts for a generation to come . " british food blair refused to comment on remarks by french president jacques chirac , who had reportedly labeled british food the worst in europe apart from that of finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has probably never tasted blair 's food " you ca n't trust people who have such lousy cooking , " chirac had said during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin in kaliningrad on sunday , according to french newspaper liberation . blair countered that he did n't want to get " tempted down that path " of returning in kind , saying that olympic competitors should approach the race with " the right diplomatic spirit . " his view was obviously not shared by british tabloid the sun , whose editors denounced chirac as a " nasty , petty racist creep " and someone who " has lost his marbles " on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees in paris on april 5 , 2004 another paper hoped britain 's queen elizabeth ii would serve chirac beans on toast - " on his head " - when he attends a dinner party hosted by her in scotland wednesday to welcome g8 leaders for their summit . " i may be staying in singapore for the rest of the week now , " blair told reporters jokingly when asked whether the bickering between paris and london would cloud his meeting with chirac in scotland . france 's stadium but the british team also took a jibe at paris , indirectly calling the city 's stade de france stadium unsuitable for the olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for the 1998 soccer world cup , the stade de france seemed to be doing pretty well when it hosted the world athletics championships in 2003 " the one thing you do have with an existing stadium is that it has been built for -lrb- soccer -rrb- , it has n't been built for athletics , " said jim sloman , the chief operating officer for the sydney 2000 games and now an advisor to the london bid . the remark , which some saw as violating ioc rules that bidders are not allowed to criticize each other , caused paris mayor bertrand delanoe to accuse his rivals of unfairness .

singapore time will give a clue to the billion-dollar question of which city will host the 2012 olympic games . just 24 hours before the announcement , the frenzy has caused people to consult lip-reading experts to get a split-second advantage over others in terms of knowing where the world 's athletes will gather seven years from now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tight-lipped rogge would point to paris should rogge close his lips after the phrase " and the host city is , " paris will party , francois grosjean , a professor of psycholionguistics at the university of neuchatel in switzerland , told afp .
if the mouth stays open , it 's london 's lucky day . clear front-runners while madrid , moscow and new york are also still in the running , insiders have said that most ioc members have lined up behind the british and french capitals - a rumor confirmed by german ioc member walter tröger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner with the logo of paris ' olympic bid " there are favorites in the opinion of my colleagues , " he said .

suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts . " currently there 's a tendency to be pessimistic in germany , " the government 's economic advisory council wrote in its last annual report .
but despite bleak growth outlooks , the situation in germany apparently is n't quite as desolate as commonly thought . for example , real wages in germany dropped by 0.9 percent over the last few years while they rose by 7.4 percent on average in the 15 old eu states , according to a report by the institute for economic and social sciences of the hans böckler foundation -lrb- wsi -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's apparently not getting too much money though that may sound bleak for wage-earners , it 's good for business , and the reason why germany leads the world in terms of exports , according to wsi 's thorsten schulten .
he added that a sound export market is also a good indicator for international competitiveness . " as these numbers show , it makes no sense to say that germany 's trade unions have too much power or that wages are too high , " he said . apples and oranges comparing germany to countries with lower wages such as poland and the czech republic is also futile , according to rolf kroker of german economic institute in cologne -lrb- iw -rrb- . productivity is much higher in germany , which can also rely on well-trained and well-qualified workers despite talk about the country 's faltering educational system , kroker added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german researchers are doing well " we 're really doing well in the field of mathematics and natural sciences as well as engineering , " he said , adding that germany 's ageing population will create problems in the long run . foreign investors do notice the current advantages of setting up shop in germany .
according to a report by ernst & young , the country takes the no. 5 spot - behind china , the us , india and poland - in a global ranking of favorite places to do business .
germany got best grades for research in development in the survey . awash with innovation with 23,000 new registrations at the european patent office , germans came in third behind the us and japan last year .
most entries came from the country 's automotive , electronic , machine construction , medical and environmental technology sectors .
in terms of the government 's support for innovation , germany comes in at the european average with 2.5 percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state 's still taking too much money from companies , according to some the area where changes are most needed is the country 's fiscal policies : german corporate taxes can not compete internationally , but the government 's reform plans have been put on hold because of likely early elections in the fall . " that 's the first thing the new government needs to deal with , " kroker said . bad bureaucracy bureaucracy is another problem . " the high degree of regulation , an inflexible labor market and high social standards all deter investors , " ernst & young 's peter englisch said , adding that other countries such as china , india and the eastern european states were benefiting from this . but access to financial investors , a good infrastructure and germany 's central location within europe were big advantages , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future 's bright ?
kroker also listed the country 's rule of law and political stability as further positive factors . " you should n't underestimate the importance of a functioning society : germany 's might be complex , but it is n't corrupt , " he added .
" that creates reliability . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- gloomy news again for german economy instead of building on last year 's recovery , the german economy appears to be heading downhill again .
on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 .
-lrb- april 26 , 2005 -rrb- reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .
but inventors are crying out for a chance to give the country a cutting-edge status .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .
leaders will arrive at the gleneagles venue in scotland throughout the day on wednesday before dining with queen elizabeth .

however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .
leaders will arrive at the gleneagles venue in scotland throughout the day on wednesday before dining with queen elizabeth .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .
leaders will arrive at the gleneagles venue in scotland throughout the day on wednesday before dining with queen elizabeth .

when asked if reports about the quality problems at mercedes had changed his view at all , he simply shrugged .
" foreign cars have problems , too , " he said .
price point but foreign cars tend to be much cheaper than german cars .
tough economic times and a general trend towards thriftiness have made foreign cars more appealing - something that has not escaped foreign importers ' notice .
their target group ?
cost-conscious private consumers .
" germans still prefer to buy german quality , " brietsche said .
" but these days , people are prepared to make compromises .
it 's that sense of rationality that is opening the door for other brands . "
in order to compete , german carmakers find themselves entering the kind of price wars typically seen in the united states .
now , it 's not uncommon to get a discount of up to 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- on a new german car .
customers feel less bound to a particular brand than they did in the past , and are eager to reap the benefits of shopping around .

in most societies , clothes make the man .
in germany , clothes - while important - are secondary to the car you drive .
the business executive who pulls into his reserved company parking spot in a lexus , for example , is bound to attract questioning stares .
markus h. is a salesman who , due to the nature of his job , spends a lot of time in his car - an audi .
while personally interested in toyota 's hybrid car , the prius , he knew that would n't jive with the image his company was trying to present .
" you have to bear in mind what your customers might think if you pull up outside their business in a foreign car , " he said .
" some of them might think you 're not earning enough to be able to afford a quality german car , and that reflects badly on your employer . "
the pull of a shiny new benz or bmw is still strong enough in germany to have firmly planted itself in the minds of the country 's immigrant communities .
reza , an iranian who works part-time as a taxi driver , has gotten used to the comfort and road-handling of the mercedes he drives while on the job .
privately , he does n't yet own a car , but when asked what he would buy given the choice , he does n't even have to think about it : " a mercedes , " he says with a smile .
in germany 's turkish community , it 's not uncommon for four or five young men to pool their savings in order to buy a single mercedes or bmw which they then have to share , rather than to each individually purchase a foreign car they could call their own .

suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts . " currently there 's a tendency to be pessimistic in germany , " the government 's economic advisory council wrote in its last annual report .
but despite bleak growth outlooks , the situation in germany apparently is n't quite as desolate as commonly thought . for example , real wages in germany dropped by 0.9 percent over the last few years while they rose by 7.4 percent on average in the 15 old eu states , according to a report by the institute for economic and social sciences of the hans böckler foundation -lrb- wsi -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's apparently not getting too much money though that may sound bleak for wage-earners , it 's good for business , and the reason why germany leads the world in terms of exports , according to wsi 's thorsten schulten .
he added that a sound export market is also a good indicator for international competitiveness . " as these numbers show , it makes no sense to say that germany 's trade unions have too much power or that wages are too high , " he said . apples and oranges comparing germany to countries with lower wages such as poland and the czech republic is also futile , according to rolf kroker of german economic institute in cologne -lrb- iw -rrb- . productivity is much higher in germany , which can also rely on well-trained and well-qualified workers despite talk about the country 's faltering educational system , kroker added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german researchers are doing well " we 're really doing well in the field of mathematics and natural sciences as well as engineering , " he said , adding that germany 's ageing population will create problems in the long run . foreign investors do notice the current advantages of setting up shop in germany .
according to a report by ernst & young , the country takes the no. 5 spot - behind china , the us , india and poland - in a global ranking of favorite places to do business .
germany got best grades for research in development in the survey . awash with innovation with 23,000 new registrations at the european patent office , germans came in third behind the us and japan last year .
most entries came from the country 's automotive , electronic , machine construction , medical and environmental technology sectors .
in terms of the government 's support for innovation , germany comes in at the european average with 2.5 percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state 's still taking too much money from companies , according to some the area where changes are most needed is the country 's fiscal policies : german corporate taxes can not compete internationally , but the government 's reform plans have been put on hold because of likely early elections in the fall . " that 's the first thing the new government needs to deal with , " kroker said . bad bureaucracy bureaucracy is another problem . " the high degree of regulation , an inflexible labor market and high social standards all deter investors , " ernst & young 's peter englisch said , adding that other countries such as china , india and the eastern european states were benefiting from this . but access to financial investors , a good infrastructure and germany 's central location within europe were big advantages , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future 's bright ?
kroker also listed the country 's rule of law and political stability as further positive factors . " you should n't underestimate the importance of a functioning society : germany 's might be complex , but it is n't corrupt , " he added .
" that creates reliability . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- gloomy news again for german economy instead of building on last year 's recovery , the german economy appears to be heading downhill again .
on tuesday , the country 's top economic institutes slashed their growth forecast for 2005 .
-lrb- april 26 , 2005 -rrb- reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .

swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .

lufthansa is also barred from offering more flights on the affected routes so that any new entrant would have a fair chance to establish itself as a credible competitor . lufthansa said the decision to give up the slots at several european airports would not significantly change its competitive position or hit its earnings .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .

the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .

" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .
german weekly wirtschaftswoche claimed that volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg , " and that more resignations - including that of vw 's head of personnel and overseer of the german government 's economic reforms , peter hartz - would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz so far , hartz has the full backing of vw 's supervisory board .
and even german chancellor gerhard schröder lauded hartz 's " innovative " achievements on tuesday , while insisting he would not allow himself to be drawn into what were ultimately vw 's internal affairs . role of unions under scrutiny the scandal at volkswagen has sparked a much wider debate about the overall power of the unions , already battling a decline in grassroots support in germany . some observers suggest management could try to use the affair to loosen the union grip on europe 's biggest carmaker and push through anti-union reforms . while the full scale of the bribe-taking scandal is still far from clear , it does appear that the affair is a product of the intricate network of power connections and interdependencies between politicians , management and unions that sets vw apart from other german companies . a top politician from the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , saw the events at vw as symptomatic of the shortcomings of the german system whereby both shareholders and employee representatives hold a similar number of seats on the supervisory board . volkert 's successor , bernd osterloh , lashed back at such attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall flags wave in front of a vw production facility " there are forces that are trying to weaken employees ' representation within vw , where the strength of the works council and of the ig metall union has long been a thorn in the flesh to them , " osterloh was quoted by the business daily handelsblatt as saying in a letter to shareholders . osterloh warned against allowing the solidarity between the works council , ig metall and the unions from being destroyed either from the inside or the outside . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

small tech companies , however , want patents to cover only the invention running the program , allowing the idea and the functionality of the software to be used by others . until now , only the underlying programming code has been subject to copyright in europe .
that means that programmers could not reuse the code from other copyrighted software products , but could easily write their own code , which would imitate or improve the functionality of other programs . licensing ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer running linux , a free-source operating system the prospect of patents covering the underlying programming code is particularly worrying to backers of the so-called ' open source ' movement , who are staunch supporters of the free exchange of ideas in software development . the proposed eu bill would be similar to the us model of providing patent protection to software products .
of the 17,000 software patents , which are registered in the states each year , more than 3,000 are owned by the computer giant microsoft . the online reseller amazon , for example , holds a patent to the so-called " 1-click " checkout system , which enables users to shop online without repeatedly having to enter their passwords or credit card information .
because the 1-click-purchase is a patented technology , amazon is entitled to impose licensing fees to anybody who wants to implement such a system on their website . protecting or stifling the software industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the european patent office opponents of the software patents believe that legal restrictions of this kind will increase the number of trivial patents , stifle creativity and harm the information technology industry in the long run . " an agreement among all actors that software should not be patented , so providing an unequivocal definition in the directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- that guarantees this is clearly in the general interest , " said hans-werner müller , head of the ueapme association representing small companies . " the cacophony of misinformation and misleading spin from the large industry lobby in the run up to this vote has obscured the general consensus on preventing the patenting of pure software , " he added . the wind , however , appears to be blowing in favor of the big groups after a parliamentary committee rejected last month proposed amendments to the bill which would have restricted patents to the invention underlying a computer program . those in favor of patents for programs , on the other hand , acknowledge that victory is not a foregone conclusion . " the game is not over .
the defeated amendments could find a second wind on the 6th of july , " said former parliament president pat cox . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu deadline for microsoft expires the european union on wednesday began studying proposals from microsoft to end an antitrust row that has seen the us software giant threatened with heavy fines .

in a sign of a softening stance towards a call by british prime minister tony blair to reform europe 's generous system of farm subsidies under the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , fischer told the bbc late monday , " i think we can make progress but we should avoid confrontation .
we have different interests and europe needs compromise . "
blair , whose government took on the rotating , six-month presidency of the 25-nation bloc last friday , has said he wants to turn a crisis over the eu 's budget and fledgling constitution into an opportunity for reform .
he has promised to support a review of a controversial budget rebate granted to britain provided this forms part of a sweeping shake-up of the european union 's long-term financing .
fischer noted that the group had worked hard in recent years to reduce the amount of its budget that is spent on subsidies from 80 percent to 40 percent and predicted the ratio would fall further .
" i think moving forward with the reforms , agriculture policy , i think a further decrease is manageable if you can reach a consensus , " he said .
" you need a consensus for that and it would be very helpful if the british presidency will take the lead and give also a signal with the rebate . "
in practical terms with the eu now comprising 25 member states , the german diplomat said it was vital to agree on the 2007-2013 budget .

singapore time will give a clue to the billion-dollar question of which city will host the 2012 olympic games . just 24 hours before the announcement , the frenzy has caused people to consult lip-reading experts to get a split-second advantage over others in terms of knowing where the world 's athletes will gather seven years from now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tight-lipped rogge would point to paris should rogge close his lips after the phrase " and the host city is , " paris will party , francois grosjean , a professor of psycholionguistics at the university of neuchatel in switzerland , told afp .
if the mouth stays open , it 's london 's lucky day . clear front-runners while madrid , moscow and new york are also still in the running , insiders have said that most ioc members have lined up behind the british and french capitals - a rumor confirmed by german ioc member walter tröger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner with the logo of paris ' olympic bid " there are favorites in the opinion of my colleagues , " he said .
" paris and london are definitely at the front , but everything 's possible .
paris clearly has a chance , because its bid is a good one and because it 's probably time for paris again .
but that 's purely speculative . " the british prime minister did n't seem to take any chances and arrived at the ioc meeting place in singapore monday for an intense two-day lobbying effort in support of london 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium dome in london 's greenwich , wednesday , may 29 , 2002 .
dome minister lord falconer made a statment to the house of lords in which he announced that the building will be taken over by the meridian delta consortium for nothing .
they will be turning the structure into a 20,000 seat arena for sports and concerts .
-lrb- ap photo / richard lewis -rrb- " the spirit of london 2012 will be the best of the spirit of the olympic movement , " said blair , who met with dozens of ioc members in private talks .
" we will build something that does n't just last for the few weeks of the games , but lasts for a generation to come . " british food blair refused to comment on remarks by french president jacques chirac , who had reportedly labeled british food the worst in europe apart from that of finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has probably never tasted blair 's food " you ca n't trust people who have such lousy cooking , " chirac had said during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin in kaliningrad on sunday , according to french newspaper liberation . blair countered that he did n't want to get " tempted down that path " of returning in kind , saying that olympic competitors should approach the race with " the right diplomatic spirit . " his view was obviously not shared by british tabloid the sun , whose editors denounced chirac as a " nasty , petty racist creep " and someone who " has lost his marbles " on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees in paris on april 5 , 2004 another paper hoped britain 's queen elizabeth ii would serve chirac beans on toast - " on his head " - when he attends a dinner party hosted by her in scotland wednesday to welcome g8 leaders for their summit . " i may be staying in singapore for the rest of the week now , " blair told reporters jokingly when asked whether the bickering between paris and london would cloud his meeting with chirac in scotland . france 's stadium but the british team also took a jibe at paris , indirectly calling the city 's stade de france stadium unsuitable for the olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for the 1998 soccer world cup , the stade de france seemed to be doing pretty well when it hosted the world athletics championships in 2003 " the one thing you do have with an existing stadium is that it has been built for -lrb- soccer -rrb- , it has n't been built for athletics , " said jim sloman , the chief operating officer for the sydney 2000 games and now an advisor to the london bid . the remark , which some saw as violating ioc rules that bidders are not allowed to criticize each other , caused paris mayor bertrand delanoe to accuse his rivals of unfairness .

singapore time will give a clue to the billion-dollar question of which city will host the 2012 olympic games . just 24 hours before the announcement , the frenzy has caused people to consult lip-reading experts to get a split-second advantage over others in terms of knowing where the world 's athletes will gather seven years from now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tight-lipped rogge would point to paris should rogge close his lips after the phrase " and the host city is , " paris will party , francois grosjean , a professor of psycholionguistics at the university of neuchatel in switzerland , told afp .
if the mouth stays open , it 's london 's lucky day . clear front-runners while madrid , moscow and new york are also still in the running , insiders have said that most ioc members have lined up behind the british and french capitals - a rumor confirmed by german ioc member walter tröger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner with the logo of paris ' olympic bid " there are favorites in the opinion of my colleagues , " he said .
" paris and london are definitely at the front , but everything 's possible .
paris clearly has a chance , because its bid is a good one and because it 's probably time for paris again .
but that 's purely speculative . " the british prime minister did n't seem to take any chances and arrived at the ioc meeting place in singapore monday for an intense two-day lobbying effort in support of london 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium dome in london 's greenwich , wednesday , may 29 , 2002 .
dome minister lord falconer made a statment to the house of lords in which he announced that the building will be taken over by the meridian delta consortium for nothing .
they will be turning the structure into a 20,000 seat arena for sports and concerts .
-lrb- ap photo / richard lewis -rrb- " the spirit of london 2012 will be the best of the spirit of the olympic movement , " said blair , who met with dozens of ioc members in private talks .
" we will build something that does n't just last for the few weeks of the games , but lasts for a generation to come . " british food blair refused to comment on remarks by french president jacques chirac , who had reportedly labeled british food the worst in europe apart from that of finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has probably never tasted blair 's food " you ca n't trust people who have such lousy cooking , " chirac had said during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin in kaliningrad on sunday , according to french newspaper liberation . blair countered that he did n't want to get " tempted down that path " of returning in kind , saying that olympic competitors should approach the race with " the right diplomatic spirit . " his view was obviously not shared by british tabloid the sun , whose editors denounced chirac as a " nasty , petty racist creep " and someone who " has lost his marbles " on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees in paris on april 5 , 2004 another paper hoped britain 's queen elizabeth ii would serve chirac beans on toast - " on his head " - when he attends a dinner party hosted by her in scotland wednesday to welcome g8 leaders for their summit . " i may be staying in singapore for the rest of the week now , " blair told reporters jokingly when asked whether the bickering between paris and london would cloud his meeting with chirac in scotland . france 's stadium but the british team also took a jibe at paris , indirectly calling the city 's stade de france stadium unsuitable for the olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for the 1998 soccer world cup , the stade de france seemed to be doing pretty well when it hosted the world athletics championships in 2003 " the one thing you do have with an existing stadium is that it has been built for -lrb- soccer -rrb- , it has n't been built for athletics , " said jim sloman , the chief operating officer for the sydney 2000 games and now an advisor to the london bid . the remark , which some saw as violating ioc rules that bidders are not allowed to criticize each other , caused paris mayor bertrand delanoe to accuse his rivals of unfairness . " i think that to deserve victory you have to respect the olympic spirit and demonstrate fair play , " he said . only time and rogge 's lips will tell . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain , france lock horns over budget not since britain 's joining of the us-led invasion of iraq has the country seemed so isolated in the eu as tony blair remains at loggerheads with france and germany over eu spending plans ahead of a crucial summit .

in a sign of a softening stance towards a call by british prime minister tony blair to reform europe 's generous system of farm subsidies under the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , fischer told the bbc late monday , " i think we can make progress but we should avoid confrontation .
we have different interests and europe needs compromise . "
blair , whose government took on the rotating , six-month presidency of the 25-nation bloc last friday , has said he wants to turn a crisis over the eu 's budget and fledgling constitution into an opportunity for reform .
he has promised to support a review of a controversial budget rebate granted to britain provided this forms part of a sweeping shake-up of the european union 's long-term financing .
fischer noted that the group had worked hard in recent years to reduce the amount of its budget that is spent on subsidies from 80 percent to 40 percent and predicted the ratio would fall further .
" i think moving forward with the reforms , agriculture policy , i think a further decrease is manageable if you can reach a consensus , " he said .
" you need a consensus for that and it would be very helpful if the british presidency will take the lead and give also a signal with the rebate . "
in practical terms with the eu now comprising 25 member states , the german diplomat said it was vital to agree on the 2007-2013 budget .

in a sign of a softening stance towards a call by british prime minister tony blair to reform europe 's generous system of farm subsidies under the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , fischer told the bbc late monday , " i think we can make progress but we should avoid confrontation .
we have different interests and europe needs compromise . "
blair , whose government took on the rotating , six-month presidency of the 25-nation bloc last friday , has said he wants to turn a crisis over the eu 's budget and fledgling constitution into an opportunity for reform .
he has promised to support a review of a controversial budget rebate granted to britain provided this forms part of a sweeping shake-up of the european union 's long-term financing .
fischer noted that the group had worked hard in recent years to reduce the amount of its budget that is spent on subsidies from 80 percent to 40 percent and predicted the ratio would fall further .
" i think moving forward with the reforms , agriculture policy , i think a further decrease is manageable if you can reach a consensus , " he said .
" you need a consensus for that and it would be very helpful if the british presidency will take the lead and give also a signal with the rebate . "
in practical terms with the eu now comprising 25 member states , the german diplomat said it was vital to agree on the 2007-2013 budget .
" if we can manage to reach an agreement during the british presidency , germany will applaud , " he said . dw-world.de blair launches presidency with informal summit britain began its six-month presidency of the european union friday with prime minister tony blair pledging to hold an informal summit later this year to debate the future of the crisis-torn bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc fischer says progress possible on eu german foreign minister joschka fischer has said the european union can make progress with a debate on reforming farm subsidies and hoped it would agree on a budget during britain 's presidency of the bloc .
in a sign of a softening stance towards a call by british prime minister tony blair to reform europe 's generous system of farm subsidies under the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , fischer told the bbc late monday , " i think we can make progress but we should avoid confrontation .
we have different interests and europe needs compromise . "
blair , whose government took on the rotating , six-month presidency of the 25-nation bloc last friday , has said he wants to turn a crisis over the eu 's budget and fledgling constitution into an opportunity for reform .
he has promised to support a review of a controversial budget rebate granted to britain provided this forms part of a sweeping shake-up of the european union 's long-term financing .
fischer noted that the group had worked hard in recent years to reduce the amount of its budget that is spent on subsidies from 80 percent to 40 percent and predicted the ratio would fall further .
" i think moving forward with the reforms , agriculture policy , i think a further decrease is manageable if you can reach a consensus , " he said .
" you need a consensus for that and it would be very helpful if the british presidency will take the lead and give also a signal with the rebate . "
in practical terms with the eu now comprising 25 member states , the german diplomat said it was vital to agree on the 2007-2013 budget .
" if we can manage to reach an agreement during the british presidency , germany will applaud , " he said . dw-world.de blair launches presidency with informal summit britain began its six-month presidency of the european union friday with prime minister tony blair pledging to hold an informal summit later this year to debate the future of the crisis-torn bloc .

in a sign of a softening stance towards a call by british prime minister tony blair to reform europe 's generous system of farm subsidies under the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- , fischer told the bbc late monday , " i think we can make progress but we should avoid confrontation .
we have different interests and europe needs compromise . "
blair , whose government took on the rotating , six-month presidency of the 25-nation bloc last friday , has said he wants to turn a crisis over the eu 's budget and fledgling constitution into an opportunity for reform .
he has promised to support a review of a controversial budget rebate granted to britain provided this forms part of a sweeping shake-up of the european union 's long-term financing .
fischer noted that the group had worked hard in recent years to reduce the amount of its budget that is spent on subsidies from 80 percent to 40 percent and predicted the ratio would fall further .
" i think moving forward with the reforms , agriculture policy , i think a further decrease is manageable if you can reach a consensus , " he said .
" you need a consensus for that and it would be very helpful if the british presidency will take the lead and give also a signal with the rebate . "
in practical terms with the eu now comprising 25 member states , the german diplomat said it was vital to agree on the 2007-2013 budget .
" if we can manage to reach an agreement during the british presidency , germany will applaud , " he said . dw-world.de blair launches presidency with informal summit britain began its six-month presidency of the european union friday with prime minister tony blair pledging to hold an informal summit later this year to debate the future of the crisis-torn bloc .

the project was " no longer on agenda , " a vw spokesman said , explaining that the decision was made in compliance with the pope 's own wishes .
vw had said in april that it would be interested in building a car for pope benedict xvi when he attends the world youth day celebrations in august in cologne .
vw would be one of the sponsors for the event , making available at least 100 vehicles .
but the pope had indicated he would use the existing vehicles made for his predecessor , the late john paul ii , and asked vw to make more cars available for charitable purposes , the spokesman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .
german weekly wirtschaftswoche claimed that volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg , " and that more resignations - including that of vw 's head of personnel and overseer of the german government 's economic reforms , peter hartz - would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz so far , hartz has the full backing of vw 's supervisory board .
and even german chancellor gerhard schröder lauded hartz 's " innovative " achievements on tuesday , while insisting he would not allow himself to be drawn into what were ultimately vw 's internal affairs . role of unions under scrutiny the scandal at volkswagen has sparked a much wider debate about the overall power of the unions , already battling a decline in grassroots support in germany . some observers suggest management could try to use the affair to loosen the union grip on europe 's biggest carmaker and push through anti-union reforms . while the full scale of the bribe-taking scandal is still far from clear , it does appear that the affair is a product of the intricate network of power connections and interdependencies between politicians , management and unions that sets vw apart from other german companies . a top politician from the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , saw the events at vw as symptomatic of the shortcomings of the german system whereby both shareholders and employee representatives hold a similar number of seats on the supervisory board . volkert 's successor , bernd osterloh , lashed back at such attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall flags wave in front of a vw production facility " there are forces that are trying to weaken employees ' representation within vw , where the strength of the works council and of the ig metall union has long been a thorn in the flesh to them , " osterloh was quoted by the business daily handelsblatt as saying in a letter to shareholders . osterloh warned against allowing the solidarity between the works council , ig metall and the unions from being destroyed either from the inside or the outside . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2005 eu parliament to vote on software patents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters voiced their opposition to to the law in strasbourg tuesday a highly controversial bill on software patents faces a crucial vote in the european parliament after a four-year struggle between small firms and technology giants . the software patent bill , which will be put to vote in the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday , aims to give a boost to technological innovation in the european union by giving greater legal protection to inventions relying on computers such as mobile telephones , washing machines and car braking systems . technology experts and software companies have been at loggerheads over how far patent protection should go . big tech companies are in favor of a patent system that would not only protect the invention running a computer program but the program itself as well .
small tech companies , however , want patents to cover only the invention running the program , allowing the idea and the functionality of the software to be used by others . until now , only the underlying programming code has been subject to copyright in europe .
that means that programmers could not reuse the code from other copyrighted software products , but could easily write their own code , which would imitate or improve the functionality of other programs . licensing ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer running linux , a free-source operating system the prospect of patents covering the underlying programming code is particularly worrying to backers of the so-called ' open source ' movement , who are staunch supporters of the free exchange of ideas in software development . the proposed eu bill would be similar to the us model of providing patent protection to software products .
of the 17,000 software patents , which are registered in the states each year , more than 3,000 are owned by the computer giant microsoft . the online reseller amazon , for example , holds a patent to the so-called " 1-click " checkout system , which enables users to shop online without repeatedly having to enter their passwords or credit card information .
because the 1-click-purchase is a patented technology , amazon is entitled to impose licensing fees to anybody who wants to implement such a system on their website . protecting or stifling the software industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the european patent office opponents of the software patents believe that legal restrictions of this kind will increase the number of trivial patents , stifle creativity and harm the information technology industry in the long run . " an agreement among all actors that software should not be patented , so providing an unequivocal definition in the directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- that guarantees this is clearly in the general interest , " said hans-werner müller , head of the ueapme association representing small companies . " the cacophony of misinformation and misleading spin from the large industry lobby in the run up to this vote has obscured the general consensus on preventing the patenting of pure software , " he added . the wind , however , appears to be blowing in favor of the big groups after a parliamentary committee rejected last month proposed amendments to the bill which would have restricted patents to the invention underlying a computer program . those in favor of patents for programs , on the other hand , acknowledge that victory is not a foregone conclusion . " the game is not over .
the defeated amendments could find a second wind on the 6th of july , " said former parliament president pat cox . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu deadline for microsoft expires the european union on wednesday began studying proposals from microsoft to end an antitrust row that has seen the us software giant threatened with heavy fines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .
german weekly wirtschaftswoche claimed that volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg , " and that more resignations - including that of vw 's head of personnel and overseer of the german government 's economic reforms , peter hartz - would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz so far , hartz has the full backing of vw 's supervisory board .
and even german chancellor gerhard schröder lauded hartz 's " innovative " achievements on tuesday , while insisting he would not allow himself to be drawn into what were ultimately vw 's internal affairs . role of unions under scrutiny the scandal at volkswagen has sparked a much wider debate about the overall power of the unions , already battling a decline in grassroots support in germany . some observers suggest management could try to use the affair to loosen the union grip on europe 's biggest carmaker and push through anti-union reforms . while the full scale of the bribe-taking scandal is still far from clear , it does appear that the affair is a product of the intricate network of power connections and interdependencies between politicians , management and unions that sets vw apart from other german companies . a top politician from the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , saw the events at vw as symptomatic of the shortcomings of the german system whereby both shareholders and employee representatives hold a similar number of seats on the supervisory board . volkert 's successor , bernd osterloh , lashed back at such attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall flags wave in front of a vw production facility " there are forces that are trying to weaken employees ' representation within vw , where the strength of the works council and of the ig metall union has long been a thorn in the flesh to them , " osterloh was quoted by the business daily handelsblatt as saying in a letter to shareholders . osterloh warned against allowing the solidarity between the works council , ig metall and the unions from being destroyed either from the inside or the outside . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the commitments given by lufthansa ensure that competitors will be able to offer new services in competition with the merged company . " " this is a partnership for all our customers , " said wolfgang mayrhuber , chairman and ceo of lufthansa , in a statement .

-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- " we want to shape german policies together with chancellor schröder over the next four years , " müntefering said .
" our prime focus for these years will be on employment , security and a life with dignity for all . " courting middle class voters with the reformist agenda 2010 platform , the social democrats are aiming at middle class voters who guaranteed the spd 's success in general elections in 1998 and 2002 .
in addition the new manifesto now also includes tax cuts for medium-sized businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mädchen malen im gruppenraum der kindertagesstätte " landmäuse " im mecklenburgischen pokrent , während die jungen in der spielecke mit autos spielen -lrb- archivfoto vom 28.11.2003 -rrb- .

the party also wants to solve a chronic cash shortage in the german public health service by broadening the basis of contributions to include for the first time civil servants and self-employed people . the social democrats vowed to leave the system of sector-wide collective bargaining for wages untouched , but said they were planning to introduce minimum wages in industries not covered by the system . a tax for the rich most controversial of all , however , are proposals to slap a 3-percent extra tax on incomes above 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 296,700 -rrb- a year .
they are a concession to the spd 's left fringe which had been on the verge of open revolt following the loss of the spd 's traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia in a regional election in may . now leftist social democrats like andrea nahles seem reconciled with schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein archivbild vom 10 .
november 1997 zeigt die spd-linke andrea nahles in bonn .
nahles hat den reformkurs von bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder erneut kritisiert , reformen grundsaetzlich aber befuerwortet .
" es waere fatal , jetzt zu sagen , wir sollten den ganzen reformprozess abbrechen " , sagte nahles am dienstag , 30 .
september 2003 , im zdf- " morgenmagazin " .
ihre kritik an schroeder sei der gegenwaertigen ausnahmesituation geschuldet .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- * * zu apd8819 * * " we do not take back the reforms of the past few years , but our campaign will have a new thrust , " she said .
" we say that domestic consumption in germany urgently needs a boost to be able to create jobs and economic growth .
chancellor schröder and the spd 's leftwing share this view so that the entire party stands united behind this manifesto . " come-back kid ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will schröder end up beating merkel after all ?
germans , however , seem to want political change .
currently they give the opposition christian democrats a commanding 18-point lead over the spd .
but after putting early elections on track by losing a confidence vote last friday , gerhard schröder appeared rejuvenated . at a weekend campaign appearance he urged cheering social democrats to ignore the polls and take confidence in another " come from behind " win as in 2002 . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election campaign starts , but hurdles remain the race towards early general elections in germany has begun in earnest , although many experts warn it is by no means certain that polls will take place in the autumn .
-lrb- july 3 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's not so gloomy economy suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts .
-lrb- july 5 , 2005 -rrb- what next for schröder 's government ?
when the german parliament defeated the confidence vote brought by chancellor gerhard schröder on friday , it set in motion a procedure designed to end in a general election in the fall .

" i may be staying in singapore for the rest of the week now , " blair told reporters jokingly when asked whether the bickering between paris and london would cloud his meeting with chirac in scotland . france 's stadium but the british team also took a jibe at paris , indirectly calling the city 's stade de france stadium unsuitable for the olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for the 1998 soccer world cup , the stade de france seemed to be doing pretty well when it hosted the world athletics championships in 2003 " the one thing you do have with an existing stadium is that it has been built for -lrb- soccer -rrb- , it has n't been built for athletics , " said jim sloman , the chief operating officer for the sydney 2000 games and now an advisor to the london bid . the remark , which some saw as violating ioc rules that bidders are not allowed to criticize each other , caused paris mayor bertrand delanoe to accuse his rivals of unfairness .

singapore time will give a clue to the billion-dollar question of which city will host the 2012 olympic games . just 24 hours before the announcement , the frenzy has caused people to consult lip-reading experts to get a split-second advantage over others in terms of knowing where the world 's athletes will gather seven years from now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tight-lipped rogge would point to paris should rogge close his lips after the phrase " and the host city is , " paris will party , francois grosjean , a professor of psycholionguistics at the university of neuchatel in switzerland , told afp .
if the mouth stays open , it 's london 's lucky day . clear front-runners while madrid , moscow and new york are also still in the running , insiders have said that most ioc members have lined up behind the british and french capitals - a rumor confirmed by german ioc member walter tröger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner with the logo of paris ' olympic bid " there are favorites in the opinion of my colleagues , " he said .
" paris and london are definitely at the front , but everything 's possible .
paris clearly has a chance , because its bid is a good one and because it 's probably time for paris again .
but that 's purely speculative . " the british prime minister did n't seem to take any chances and arrived at the ioc meeting place in singapore monday for an intense two-day lobbying effort in support of london 's bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the millennium dome in london 's greenwich , wednesday , may 29 , 2002 .
dome minister lord falconer made a statment to the house of lords in which he announced that the building will be taken over by the meridian delta consortium for nothing .
they will be turning the structure into a 20,000 seat arena for sports and concerts .
-lrb- ap photo / richard lewis -rrb- " the spirit of london 2012 will be the best of the spirit of the olympic movement , " said blair , who met with dozens of ioc members in private talks .
" we will build something that does n't just last for the few weeks of the games , but lasts for a generation to come . " british food blair refused to comment on remarks by french president jacques chirac , who had reportedly labeled british food the worst in europe apart from that of finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac has probably never tasted blair 's food " you ca n't trust people who have such lousy cooking , " chirac had said during a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder and russian president vladimir putin in kaliningrad on sunday , according to french newspaper liberation . blair countered that he did n't want to get " tempted down that path " of returning in kind , saying that olympic competitors should approach the race with " the right diplomatic spirit . " his view was obviously not shared by british tabloid the sun , whose editors denounced chirac as a " nasty , petty racist creep " and someone who " has lost his marbles " on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth ii is greeted by french president jacques chirac on the champs elysees in paris on april 5 , 2004 another paper hoped britain 's queen elizabeth ii would serve chirac beans on toast - " on his head " - when he attends a dinner party hosted by her in scotland wednesday to welcome g8 leaders for their summit . " i may be staying in singapore for the rest of the week now , " blair told reporters jokingly when asked whether the bickering between paris and london would cloud his meeting with chirac in scotland . france 's stadium but the british team also took a jibe at paris , indirectly calling the city 's stade de france stadium unsuitable for the olympics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : built for the 1998 soccer world cup , the stade de france seemed to be doing pretty well when it hosted the world athletics championships in 2003 " the one thing you do have with an existing stadium is that it has been built for -lrb- soccer -rrb- , it has n't been built for athletics , " said jim sloman , the chief operating officer for the sydney 2000 games and now an advisor to the london bid . the remark , which some saw as violating ioc rules that bidders are not allowed to criticize each other , caused paris mayor bertrand delanoe to accuse his rivals of unfairness . " i think that to deserve victory you have to respect the olympic spirit and demonstrate fair play , " he said . only time and rogge 's lips will tell . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain , france lock horns over budget not since britain 's joining of the us-led invasion of iraq has the country seemed so isolated in the eu as tony blair remains at loggerheads with france and germany over eu spending plans ahead of a crucial summit .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .
the approval from the competition authorities , which came a day after a similar clearance from the united states , was the final step in the takeover . eu says competition assured bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes " i welcome airline consolidation in europe , but it should not lead to higher prices or reduced choice of carrier , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes -lrb- photo -rrb- .

lufthansa is also barred from offering more flights on the affected routes so that any new entrant would have a fair chance to establish itself as a credible competitor . lufthansa said the decision to give up the slots at several european airports would not significantly change its competitive position or hit its earnings .
" it will not greatly impact on our competitive position , " a spokeswoman said and added that the company is still maintaining its full-year profit targets . lufthansa said previously that it expects operating profit for 2005 to be on a par with the 383 million euros it recorded last year . lufthansa group last year had revenue of nearly 17 billion euros , with its more than 90,000 staff members transporting 50.9 million passengers and 1.75 million tons of cargo .

" in light of these commitments , the commission has concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " said the commission , the executive which regulates competition in the 25 member states . lufthansa has said it wants to acquire swiss to expand its international network and boost its competitive position in europe .
the purchase , which cost lufthansa up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 370 million -rrb- , is the second-biggest merger in the european aviation sector following that of air france and klm a year ago . germany 's flag carrier signed a deal on march 22 to take over its ailing swiss counterpart , which was created after swissair collapsed in 2001 .
swiss has since faced huge financial problems , battered largely by the unrelenting rise in low-cost airlines around europe . the german airline had already received a green light from the swiss government and corporate shareholders , who together hold 85 percent of swiss and have agreed on a symbolic sum for their stock .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .
german weekly wirtschaftswoche claimed that volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg , " and that more resignations - including that of vw 's head of personnel and overseer of the german government 's economic reforms , peter hartz - would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz so far , hartz has the full backing of vw 's supervisory board .
and even german chancellor gerhard schröder lauded hartz 's " innovative " achievements on tuesday , while insisting he would not allow himself to be drawn into what were ultimately vw 's internal affairs . role of unions under scrutiny the scandal at volkswagen has sparked a much wider debate about the overall power of the unions , already battling a decline in grassroots support in germany . some observers suggest management could try to use the affair to loosen the union grip on europe 's biggest carmaker and push through anti-union reforms . while the full scale of the bribe-taking scandal is still far from clear , it does appear that the affair is a product of the intricate network of power connections and interdependencies between politicians , management and unions that sets vw apart from other german companies . a top politician from the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , saw the events at vw as symptomatic of the shortcomings of the german system whereby both shareholders and employee representatives hold a similar number of seats on the supervisory board . volkert 's successor , bernd osterloh , lashed back at such attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall flags wave in front of a vw production facility " there are forces that are trying to weaken employees ' representation within vw , where the strength of the works council and of the ig metall union has long been a thorn in the flesh to them , " osterloh was quoted by the business daily handelsblatt as saying in a letter to shareholders . osterloh warned against allowing the solidarity between the works council , ig metall and the unions from being destroyed either from the inside or the outside . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .
damage to pipelines or supply facilities can quickly lead to shortages and price hikes . no threat yet there 's no threat to international supply yet .
but most countries are pumping to capacity , leaving little room to maneuver .
opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .

but most countries are pumping to capacity , leaving little room to maneuver .
opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound . as the volkswagen bribery scandal deepens , the company finds itself under increasing pressure to address the allegations .
these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .
german weekly wirtschaftswoche claimed that volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg , " and that more resignations - including that of vw 's head of personnel and overseer of the german government 's economic reforms , peter hartz - would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz so far , hartz has the full backing of vw 's supervisory board .
and even german chancellor gerhard schröder lauded hartz 's " innovative " achievements on tuesday , while insisting he would not allow himself to be drawn into what were ultimately vw 's internal affairs . role of unions under scrutiny the scandal at volkswagen has sparked a much wider debate about the overall power of the unions , already battling a decline in grassroots support in germany . some observers suggest management could try to use the affair to loosen the union grip on europe 's biggest carmaker and push through anti-union reforms . while the full scale of the bribe-taking scandal is still far from clear , it does appear that the affair is a product of the intricate network of power connections and interdependencies between politicians , management and unions that sets vw apart from other german companies . a top politician from the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , saw the events at vw as symptomatic of the shortcomings of the german system whereby both shareholders and employee representatives hold a similar number of seats on the supervisory board . volkert 's successor , bernd osterloh , lashed back at such attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall flags wave in front of a vw production facility " there are forces that are trying to weaken employees ' representation within vw , where the strength of the works council and of the ig metall union has long been a thorn in the flesh to them , " osterloh was quoted by the business daily handelsblatt as saying in a letter to shareholders . osterloh warned against allowing the solidarity between the works council , ig metall and the unions from being destroyed either from the inside or the outside . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

these now include reports that vw staff set up a global network of six front companies to get supply contracts , and that former staff sought kickbacks for work in india and angola . german newspapers have reported that the scandal has caused vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , as well as an assembly plant in angola . on tuesday , the german state of lower saxony called for investigators to get to the bottom of the allegations .
vw last week called in auditors kpmg to review the matter . " there apparently was criminal energy at work and that 's why it is very important that the audit runs parallel to the investigations of the brunswick state prosecutor 's office , " lower saxony economics minister and vw supervisory board member walter hirche said on german television . lower saxony owns around 18 percent of volkswagen .
the company has so far declined to comment on the allegations . " tip of the iceberg " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal was triggered by the shock resignation last month of helmuth schuster , the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm , skoda .
schuster left the company amid allegations that he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used front companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad . the affair widened last week when the head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , announced he was resigning nine months earlier than expected .
german weekly wirtschaftswoche claimed that volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg , " and that more resignations - including that of vw 's head of personnel and overseer of the german government 's economic reforms , peter hartz - would follow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz so far , hartz has the full backing of vw 's supervisory board .
and even german chancellor gerhard schröder lauded hartz 's " innovative " achievements on tuesday , while insisting he would not allow himself to be drawn into what were ultimately vw 's internal affairs . role of unions under scrutiny the scandal at volkswagen has sparked a much wider debate about the overall power of the unions , already battling a decline in grassroots support in germany . some observers suggest management could try to use the affair to loosen the union grip on europe 's biggest carmaker and push through anti-union reforms . while the full scale of the bribe-taking scandal is still far from clear , it does appear that the affair is a product of the intricate network of power connections and interdependencies between politicians , management and unions that sets vw apart from other german companies . a top politician from the liberal fdp party , rainer brüderle , saw the events at vw as symptomatic of the shortcomings of the german system whereby both shareholders and employee representatives hold a similar number of seats on the supervisory board . volkert 's successor , bernd osterloh , lashed back at such attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall flags wave in front of a vw production facility " there are forces that are trying to weaken employees ' representation within vw , where the strength of the works council and of the ig metall union has long been a thorn in the flesh to them , " osterloh was quoted by the business daily handelsblatt as saying in a letter to shareholders . osterloh warned against allowing the solidarity between the works council , ig metall and the unions from being destroyed either from the inside or the outside . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts . " currently there 's a tendency to be pessimistic in germany , " the government 's economic advisory council wrote in its last annual report .
but despite bleak growth outlooks , the situation in germany apparently is n't quite as desolate as commonly thought . for example , real wages in germany dropped by 0.9 percent over the last few years while they rose by 7.4 percent on average in the 15 old eu states , according to a report by the institute for economic and social sciences of the hans böckler foundation -lrb- wsi -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's apparently not getting too much money though that may sound bleak for wage-earners , it 's good for business , and the reason why germany leads the world in terms of exports , according to wsi 's thorsten schulten .
he added that a sound export market is also a good indicator for international competitiveness . " as these numbers show , it makes no sense to say that germany 's trade unions have too much power or that wages are too high , " he said . apples and oranges comparing germany to countries with lower wages such as poland and the czech republic is also futile , according to rolf kroker of german economic institute in cologne -lrb- iw -rrb- . productivity is much higher in germany , which can also rely on well-trained and well-qualified workers despite talk about the country 's faltering educational system , kroker added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german researchers are doing well " we 're really doing well in the field of mathematics and natural sciences as well as engineering , " he said , adding that germany 's ageing population will create problems in the long run . foreign investors do notice the current advantages of setting up shop in germany .

germany got best grades for research in development in the survey . awash with innovation with 23,000 new registrations at the european patent office , germans came in third behind the us and japan last year .

suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts . " currently there 's a tendency to be pessimistic in germany , " the government 's economic advisory council wrote in its last annual report .
but despite bleak growth outlooks , the situation in germany apparently is n't quite as desolate as commonly thought . for example , real wages in germany dropped by 0.9 percent over the last few years while they rose by 7.4 percent on average in the 15 old eu states , according to a report by the institute for economic and social sciences of the hans böckler foundation -lrb- wsi -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's apparently not getting too much money though that may sound bleak for wage-earners , it 's good for business , and the reason why germany leads the world in terms of exports , according to wsi 's thorsten schulten .
he added that a sound export market is also a good indicator for international competitiveness . " as these numbers show , it makes no sense to say that germany 's trade unions have too much power or that wages are too high , " he said . apples and oranges comparing germany to countries with lower wages such as poland and the czech republic is also futile , according to rolf kroker of german economic institute in cologne -lrb- iw -rrb- . productivity is much higher in germany , which can also rely on well-trained and well-qualified workers despite talk about the country 's faltering educational system , kroker added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german researchers are doing well " we 're really doing well in the field of mathematics and natural sciences as well as engineering , " he said , adding that germany 's ageing population will create problems in the long run . foreign investors do notice the current advantages of setting up shop in germany .
according to a report by ernst & young , the country takes the no. 5 spot - behind china , the us , india and poland - in a global ranking of favorite places to do business .
germany got best grades for research in development in the survey . awash with innovation with 23,000 new registrations at the european patent office , germans came in third behind the us and japan last year .

" the high degree of regulation , an inflexible labor market and high social standards all deter investors , " ernst & young 's peter englisch said , adding that other countries such as china , india and the eastern european states were benefiting from this . but access to financial investors , a good infrastructure and germany 's central location within europe were big advantages , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future 's bright ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.07.2005 africa , climate dominate g8 agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : progress on poverty is expected from the summit in gleneagles rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .
and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .
leaders will arrive at the gleneagles venue in scotland throughout the day on wednesday before dining with queen elizabeth .
on thursday , the g8 will invite its counterparts from brazil , china , india and others for talks on climate change , while african issues will top the agenda on friday . robert mudge -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin live 8 concert attracts over 200,000 more than 200,000 spectators attended berlin 's live 8 concert .
for six hours , 21 music acts played as part of the series of concerts to raise awareness about global poverty , especially in africa .
-lrb- july 3 , 2005 -rrb- new topics pile up on g8 agenda leaders of the wealthiest countries gather in scotland this week and britain 's tony blair has put debt relief high on the program .

and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world . the live8 concerts for africa have left an indelible mark among generations of people who now seem convinced that something substantial can be done to make poverty history .
in the run-up to this week 's g8 summit , leaders of the eight leading industrialized nations have already agreed to wipe out $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 of the world ’ s poorest countries , most of them african . us president george w. bush , under pressure from british prime minister tony blair , has committed himself to doubling aid to africa by 2010 .
the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .
leaders will arrive at the gleneagles venue in scotland throughout the day on wednesday before dining with queen elizabeth .

the european union has pledged to double its support by 2015 .
britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer , gordon brown , has even gone on record to say that 100 percent debt relief can be achieved for the world ’ s 38 poorest countries at the summit in scotland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the live 8 concerts raised global public awareness about debt relief for africa " we 've already seen an agreement in the last few days for 100 percent debt relief for the poorest countries , we 've had an announcement from the eu 's finance and development ministers that we will double europe 's aid , and we 've now got 13 european countries that have accepted a timetable for moving to 0.7 percent of their income spent on aid , something we never achieved in 30 years despite many attempts , " said brown . critics , many of them from africa , say merely writing off debt will not lead to a sustainable recovery for many african states .
more has to be done , they say , to create favorable trade conditions for africa , especially for agricultural products , by scrapping farm subsidies for rich countries .
merely dumping tons of free wheat into countries such as ethiopia is very often counterproductive , as it destroys the incentive and more often than not , the livelihood of the local farmers . climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in the us show their support for the kyoto agreement on climate change while some progress has been made on africa , the other overriding issue at this year ’ s g8 summit looks set to divide the participants .
the gulf between europe and the united states on climate change appears to be so great that observers say there is little chance of concerted action .
the us , which has refused to ratify the kyoto treaty on curbing greenhouse gas emissions , is unwilling to accept a broad scientific consensus that climate change is a widespread problem caused , in part , by human activity . there is also general agreement that the growth in greenhouse gases has to be reduced and even reversed to minimize the potential economic and environmental risks .
however , that opinion is not shared by us president george w. bush . " some have suggested the best solution to environmental challenges and climate change is to oppose development and put the world on an energy diet , " bush said .
" but at this moment , about two billion people have no access to any modern form of energy .
blocking that access would condemn them to permanent poverty . " bush is now hoping that the other g8 leaders can be swayed to look beyond the kyoto debate and consider new technologies as a way of tackling global warming .
still , a deal on climate change looks increasingly unlikely , a sentiment echoed by german environment minister jürgen trittin , who said he was skeptical about the willingness of the us to move on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , perthshire , scotland meanwhile , details of the g8 agenda have emerged .
leaders will arrive at the gleneagles venue in scotland throughout the day on wednesday before dining with queen elizabeth .

he faces charges of computer sabotage , data manipulation and disruption of public systems . the spokeswoman for the tribunal hearing sven jaschan 's trial said the 19-year-old admitted during the first day of the closed-door hearing to having unleashed the destructive program in the spring of 2004 . the sasser worm didn ’ t require users to receive an email or open a file to be infected - just having a vulnerable windows machine connected to the internet was enough . the it departments of many organizations were caught unawares , and the worm spread further .
at the european commission in brussels , 1,200 computers shut down .
in the united states , delta airlines was forced to cancel several flights . in the german city of hanover , staff at the postbank took a step back in time and recorded transactions on paper .
and in seattle , microsoft promised a reward of $ 250,000 -lrb- 210,000 euros -rrb- for information leading to the responsible hacker . they left their doors wide open bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windows open to the word -lrb- and viruses , too -rrb- by exploiting a known hole in the local security component of windows operating system , the worm spread quickly , infecting hundreds of thousands of computers in just a few days , overloading processors and forcing systems into an unstoppable pattern of shutting down , then rebooting .
it apparently did no lasting harm . microsoft had issued a security bulletin and a patch to correct the problem two weeks earlier , but only the companies and individuals who installed the update were protected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house in which sasser was born : it 's estimated that the economic cost of the sasser worm attack ran into millions of dollars , and it was all caused by jaschan , a then 18-year-old school student working from his basement in the small north german village of waffensen . attracted by the reward , two of the hacker ’ s schoolmates tipped off microsoft , who then informed the police . a job instead of jail seven days after the worm was released , police arrested the hacker and seized his computer as evidence .
after confessing , the youth was released , and within five months was employed as an it trainee at securepoint , a german software security company .
but now it ’ s time for the young man to face the music - more or less . german public prosecutors have put the youth on trial for damages of 130,000 euros -lrb- $ 155,000 -rrb- , an amount some argue doesn ’ t reflect the scale of the crime at all . but it ’ s all prosecutors can do .
any party wanting to sue for damages needs to file a civil lawsuit against the alleged perpetrator . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers often host uninvited guests though 143 claims have been made - not surprisingly - very few large , publicly-listed companies are willing to admit their systems were defeated by a lone teenager using publicly available information . he 's just a kid if the hacker had been an adult , the court could sentence him to a fine or up to five years imprisonment .
but as a juvenile , he ’ s likely to receive a much more lenient sentence . jaschan was known as a mild-mannered and friendly teenager , a spokeswoman for the court in the northern city of verden said . " the court must hand down a sentence that can have an educational effect on the young man . " defense lawyer jens möwe says his client has learned his lesson and won ’ t re-offend .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .
that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .
the german government says oil would be 25 percent cheaper if it were n't for speculators .
but oil market experts deny that speculators exercise a long-term influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possible disruption of pipelines leads to higher prices , experts say " so-called speculators on the oil exchanges are by no means the root of the problem of today 's high oil prices , " said enno harks of the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- .
" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .
that would contradict all aspects of market logic . " many experts blame the high price on china 's growing thirst for oil .
the country currently imports 2.5 million barrels a day .
analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .
with about 20 million barrels a day , it imports nearly three times as much as china . the continued threat of a terrorist attack disrupting supply in key regions like iraq also keeps the price of oil high .
damage to pipelines or supply facilities can quickly lead to shortages and price hikes . no threat yet there 's no threat to international supply yet .
but most countries are pumping to capacity , leaving little room to maneuver .
opec is expected to increase its daily output quota by half a million barrels .
but with a worldwide demand of 80 million barrels a day , analysts say the move would be merely symbolic .
no one expects prices to drop anytime soon . " these high prices have given the market a clear signal to invest more , so that in the mid-term , one can expect greater spare capacities will drive the price down again , " said meyer-bukow . chancellor schröder ca n't afford to wait .
with early elections likely in the autumn , he wants to be seen doing something about high oil prices now even if he has little leverage against supplier countries like saudi arabia , say experts . florian nusch -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .

that was probably because the group includes the world 's number two oil supplier , russia , which has no interest in controlling crude prices . 25 percent mark-up no one can say for certain whether speculators really drive the price of oil higher .

" it is true that there is speculation amounting to several dollars during the course of a day , hours and minutes , but it will not keep up the price of oil over the space of days , weeks and months .

analysts expect that figure to double by the year 2010 . still , the united states remains the world 's biggest oil guzzler .

in gleneagles , chancellor gerhard schröder intends to present an initiative against artificially inflated oil prices . chancellor gerhard schröder has turned his focus on speculators bidding on futures , saying that they are largely to blame for current oil-price rises .
so at the g8 summit in scotland this week , he is set to present a plan mandating transparency on oil markets , making it harder for speculators to gouge the price . one of germany 's points of criticism is the limitations of the joint oil data initiative , a database where all information on production volume , reserves and international demand is recorded .
the initiative was set up in 2001 by seven international organizations , including the united nations and opec , and all key consumer and supplier nations are members . the german government says that the data initiative does n't go far enough in discouraging speculators , who they accuse of a lack of interest in the commodity itself but instead are only interested in making a fast buck . just window dressing but the database is probably the reason international oil corporations do n't complain about a lack of oil market transparency .
instead , they accuse schröder of rhetoric and say the only way to counter speculators is to abolish commodities exchanges altogether . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder wants to mandate transparency " remarks by the german government to the effect that speculators need to be curbed , or whatever they like to call it , appear to be nothing more than political posturing , " according to barbara meyer-bukow of the association of the german petroleum industry .
" that is because the market is already a very open , transparent market .
and i really do n't know how they propose to curb speculation without some type of regulatory interference in this market , which would have more of a negative effect . " eager to help german carmakers - who are the hardest hit by oil price rises as they are most exposed to fluctuations in demand - schröder appears to be on a personal crusade against speculators .
but his push for more oil market transparency met with no success at last year 's g8 summit in the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.07.2005 germany 's not so gloomy economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it time for germans to smile again ?
suffering from a faltering economy , germany has been called " the sick man of europe " and " the euro zone 's taillight . "
but the country 's situation is not quite as bad as some make it seem , according to experts . " currently there 's a tendency to be pessimistic in germany , " the government 's economic advisory council wrote in its last annual report .
but despite bleak growth outlooks , the situation in germany apparently is n't quite as desolate as commonly thought . for example , real wages in germany dropped by 0.9 percent over the last few years while they rose by 7.4 percent on average in the 15 old eu states , according to a report by the institute for economic and social sciences of the hans böckler foundation -lrb- wsi -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's apparently not getting too much money though that may sound bleak for wage-earners , it 's good for business , and the reason why germany leads the world in terms of exports , according to wsi 's thorsten schulten .
he added that a sound export market is also a good indicator for international competitiveness . " as these numbers show , it makes no sense to say that germany 's trade unions have too much power or that wages are too high , " he said . apples and oranges comparing germany to countries with lower wages such as poland and the czech republic is also futile , according to rolf kroker of german economic institute in cologne -lrb- iw -rrb- . productivity is much higher in germany , which can also rely on well-trained and well-qualified workers despite talk about the country 's faltering educational system , kroker added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german researchers are doing well " we 're really doing well in the field of mathematics and natural sciences as well as engineering , " he said , adding that germany 's ageing population will create problems in the long run . foreign investors do notice the current advantages of setting up shop in germany .
according to a report by ernst & young , the country takes the no. 5 spot - behind china , the us , india and poland - in a global ranking of favorite places to do business .
germany got best grades for research in development in the survey . awash with innovation with 23,000 new registrations at the european patent office , germans came in third behind the us and japan last year .
most entries came from the country 's automotive , electronic , machine construction , medical and environmental technology sectors .
in terms of the government 's support for innovation , germany comes in at the european average with 2.5 percent of gross domestic product . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state 's still taking too much money from companies , according to some the area where changes are most needed is the country 's fiscal policies : german corporate taxes can not compete internationally , but the government 's reform plans have been put on hold because of likely early elections in the fall . " that 's the first thing the new government needs to deal with , " kroker said . bad bureaucracy bureaucracy is another problem . " the high degree of regulation , an inflexible labor market and high social standards all deter investors , " ernst & young 's peter englisch said , adding that other countries such as china , india and the eastern european states were benefiting from this . but access to financial investors , a good infrastructure and germany 's central location within europe were big advantages , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future 's bright ?
kroker also listed the country 's rule of law and political stability as further positive factors . " you should n't underestimate the importance of a functioning society : germany 's might be complex , but it is n't corrupt , " he added .
" that creates reliability . " ina rottscheidt -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- gloomy news again for german economy instead of building on last year 's recovery , the german economy appears to be heading downhill again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.07.2005 german cars still stars ... for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans love german cars as this 1950s ad for the bmw isetta shows in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .
but as affordable foreign cars offer consumers an attractive alternative , how long will this still be the case ? stroll down a german street these days and it becomes clear that car-buying habits - just like population trends - are edging toward the multicultural .
nestled among the mercedes , bmws and volkswagens are numerous toyotas , renaults and hyundais .
the german association of motor vehicle importers -lrb- vdik -rrb- reports that the market share for foreign carmakers in germany is around 35 percent , with a slight increase in new registrations predicted for 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw logos - still covetable are germans suddenly less interested in buying german cars ?
could it be that premium brands such as mercedes benz are losing their shine ?
not necessarily .
" the situation has changed a bit , " peter brietsche of the german market research institute gfk group said in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" mercedes was always a dream that we grew up with .
it symbolizes a car that 's big , safe and has cachet .
it 's the car your boss drives .
being able to buy such a car was a sign that you 'd made it . "
that still holds true in germany , despite the fact that mercedes ' image has taken a bashing following daimler benz 's disappointing merger with us carmaker chrysler and a series of embarrassing technical and quality problems , brietsche said .
" we remember how the a-class rolled over while swerving during the so-called ' elk test , ' or how there were quality problems with the m-class at the beginning , " said brietsche .
" despite the technical problems , the image of the brand wins out in the end . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driving in a mercedes is easy in germany - just take a taxi his theory is validated on the street .
taxi driver jens kretschmer spends a lot of time in his mercedes , and says he would never even consider a foreign car .
" not for a taxi , at least , " he said .
" german cars have a much longer life , they 're more reliable . "
when asked if reports about the quality problems at mercedes had changed his view at all , he simply shrugged .
" foreign cars have problems , too , " he said .
price point but foreign cars tend to be much cheaper than german cars .
tough economic times and a general trend towards thriftiness have made foreign cars more appealing - something that has not escaped foreign importers ' notice .
their target group ?
cost-conscious private consumers .
" germans still prefer to buy german quality , " brietsche said .
" but these days , people are prepared to make compromises .
it 's that sense of rationality that is opening the door for other brands . "
in order to compete , german carmakers find themselves entering the kind of price wars typically seen in the united states .
now , it 's not uncommon to get a discount of up to 3,000 euros -lrb- $ 3,570 -rrb- on a new german car .
customers feel less bound to a particular brand than they did in the past , and are eager to reap the benefits of shopping around .
corporate equals german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor leonardo dicaprio might think it 's cool to drive a toyota prius , but in germany , he 'd get more mileage out of a benz still , not everyone can afford to follow their wallet when choosing a vehicle .
in most societies , clothes make the man .
in germany , clothes - while important - are secondary to the car you drive .
the business executive who pulls into his reserved company parking spot in a lexus , for example , is bound to attract questioning stares .
markus h. is a salesman who , due to the nature of his job , spends a lot of time in his car - an audi .
while personally interested in toyota 's hybrid car , the prius , he knew that would n't jive with the image his company was trying to present .
" you have to bear in mind what your customers might think if you pull up outside their business in a foreign car , " he said .
" some of them might think you 're not earning enough to be able to afford a quality german car , and that reflects badly on your employer . "
the pull of a shiny new benz or bmw is still strong enough in germany to have firmly planted itself in the minds of the country 's immigrant communities .
reza , an iranian who works part-time as a taxi driver , has gotten used to the comfort and road-handling of the mercedes he drives while on the job .
privately , he does n't yet own a car , but when asked what he would buy given the choice , he does n't even have to think about it : " a mercedes , " he says with a smile .
in germany 's turkish community , it 's not uncommon for four or five young men to pool their savings in order to buy a single mercedes or bmw which they then have to share , rather than to each individually purchase a foreign car they could call their own .
but then , ford fiestas tend not to turn quite so many heads when cruising the main drag , bass booming , on a saturday night . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers optimistic about china some german carmakers showing their wares at the auto shanghai 2005 motor show are hoping flashy presentations and new models will boost sales .

" our prime focus for these years will be on employment , security and a life with dignity for all . " courting middle class voters with the reformist agenda 2010 platform , the social democrats are aiming at middle class voters who guaranteed the spd 's success in general elections in 1998 and 2002 .
in addition the new manifesto now also includes tax cuts for medium-sized businesses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mädchen malen im gruppenraum der kindertagesstätte " landmäuse " im mecklenburgischen pokrent , während die jungen in der spielecke mit autos spielen -lrb- archivfoto vom 28.11.2003 -rrb- .

the party also wants to solve a chronic cash shortage in the german public health service by broadening the basis of contributions to include for the first time civil servants and self-employed people . the social democrats vowed to leave the system of sector-wide collective bargaining for wages untouched , but said they were planning to introduce minimum wages in industries not covered by the system . a tax for the rich most controversial of all , however , are proposals to slap a 3-percent extra tax on incomes above 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 296,700 -rrb- a year .
they are a concession to the spd 's left fringe which had been on the verge of open revolt following the loss of the spd 's traditional stronghold of north rhine-westphalia in a regional election in may . now leftist social democrats like andrea nahles seem reconciled with schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein archivbild vom 10 .

" we say that domestic consumption in germany urgently needs a boost to be able to create jobs and economic growth .
chancellor schröder and the spd 's leftwing share this view so that the entire party stands united behind this manifesto . " come-back kid ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will schröder end up beating merkel after all ?
germans , however , seem to want political change .
currently they give the opposition christian democrats a commanding 18-point lead over the spd .
but after putting early elections on track by losing a confidence vote last friday , gerhard schröder appeared rejuvenated . at a weekend campaign appearance he urged cheering social democrats to ignore the polls and take confidence in another " come from behind " win as in 2002 . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election campaign starts , but hurdles remain the race towards early general elections in germany has begun in earnest , although many experts warn it is by no means certain that polls will take place in the autumn .

up to 80,000 people are expected at the six-day festival , which was nominated for the nobel peace prize last year .
former church of england special envoy terry waite , who was held hostage in lebanon for nearly five years , will be among the visitors during the week .
choirs will compete for the pavarotti trophy , donated by the italian tenor .
organisers had hoped the legendary opera star would be able to present the inaugural prize in person but he has been unable to include the festival in his hectic uk schedule . "
pavarotti is a very busy man - he has sent his apologies " eisteddfod spokesman nigel davies luciano pavarotti is due to retire from performing this year , so it is hoped he can be at the festival 's golden jubilee event in 2006 to present his trophy to that year 's winners .
international singing star lesley garrett will give the first in a series of celebrity concerts at this year 's festival .
other performers during the week will include the flamenco guitarist juan martin and bass singer sir willard white who will appear in a gala concert on sunday evening with the halle orchestra .
eisteddfod spokesman nigel davies said : " pavarotti is a very busy man .
" it 's his final year of performance and it would have been lovely if could have finished his performance here at the eisteddfod and been here on saturday evening to present the inaugural pavarotti trophy in person .
" he won his first competition here in 1955 .
he has sent his apologies . "
mr davies said competitors had already begun arriving from places as far afield as togo , nepal , ghana and trinidad .
" it 's a huge operation making sure that everything goes according to plan and so far there 've been no hitches .
all we need now is fine weather . "
among new attractions at this year 's eisteddfod are three outside stages which will provide entertainment for visitors who do not watch events on the main stage inside the pavilion .
also , friday sees celtic fusions , an evening of celtic music and dance with bands from europe , north america and the british isles .
the concert is modelled on the lorient festival in brittany .

up to 80,000 people are expected at the six-day festival , which was nominated for the nobel peace prize last year .
former church of england special envoy terry waite , who was held hostage in lebanon for nearly five years , will be among the visitors during the week .
choirs will compete for the pavarotti trophy , donated by the italian tenor .
organisers had hoped the legendary opera star would be able to present the inaugural prize in person but he has been unable to include the festival in his hectic uk schedule .
pavarotti is a very busy man - he has sent his apologies eisteddfod spokesman nigel davies luciano pavarotti is due to retire from performing this year , so it is hoped he can be at the festival 's golden jubilee event in 2006 to present his trophy to that year 's winners .
international singing star lesley garrett will give the first in a series of celebrity concerts at this year 's festival .
other performers during the week will include the flamenco guitarist juan martin and bass singer sir willard white who will appear in a gala concert on sunday evening with the halle orchestra .
there are three outside stages as well as the main pavilion eisteddfod spokesman nigel davies said : " pavarotti is a very busy man .
" it 's his final year of performance and it would have been lovely if could have finished his performance here at the eisteddfod and been here on saturday evening to present the inaugural pavarotti trophy in person .
" he won his first competition here in 1955 .
he has sent his apologies . "
mr davies said competitors had already begun arriving from places as far afield as togo , nepal , ghana and trinidad .
" it 's a huge operation making sure that everything goes according to plan and so far there 've been no hitches .
all we need now is fine weather . "
among new attractions at this year 's eisteddfod are three outside stages which will provide entertainment for visitors who do not watch events on the main stage inside the pavilion .
also , friday sees celtic fusions , an evening of celtic music and dance with bands from europe , north america and the british isles .
the concert is modelled on the lorient festival in brittany .

there are fears that if financial aid is refused , work to launch a new version of the airbus will go elsewhere and threaten thousands of jobs .
more than 6,000 workers are employed at the broughton plant which builds wings for airbus passenger jets .
the firm wants to borrow £ 380m to build a fleet of smaller aircraft .
the broughton plant is already involved in building wings for airbus passenger jets , including the a380 superjumbo which made its maiden flight in may .
now the firm wants a loan to kick start production of a fleet of smaller aircraft - the a350 - with new " lightweight " wings made of carbon fibre instead of metal . "
it 's absolutely vital that we get this work " brian cameron , union official the project would help secure the long-term future of the broughton factory and create more jobs .
brian cameron , chairman of the joint shop stewards ' committee at broughton , said the new carbon fibre technology would put the factory in the forefront of aircraft production .
" it 's absolutely vital that we get this work , " he said .
" we 're already the world 's number one wing builders and we want to keep it that way .
" i 've worked here for 30 years and i 'd like to think that there 'll be a secure future here for future generations .
" if we do n't get this money , there 's a real danger the work will go to factories in other parts of europe and that would be a disaster for us . "
mr cameron will be part of a deputation led by alyn and deeside mp mark tami , which will meet uk trade and industry secretary alan johnson in london to press the case for a loan .
last month , mr tami and delyn mp david hanson had talks with the prime minister , who visited the broughton plant during the general election campaign .
tuesday 's meeting at the department of trade and industry will be followed by a meeting with wales office minister nick ainger .
on wednesday , flintshire council leaders will join the union delegation for a further meeting at the department of trade and industry .

the newly-launched smokefree action coalition surveyed the smoking policies of every council in england and wales .
it found some councils - such as liverpool , manchester , poole and sheffield - were pushing for smokefree work places and enclosed public areas .
but most were still doing little more than banning smoking in their own offices .
too many councils are still doing little or nothing to promote smoke freedom deborah arnott only a quarter of all councils - 99 out of 401 - were actively working with nhs primary care trusts and others to promote smokefree public places .
in london , just two out of 33 councils were taking action .
smokefree action said the survey showed the urgent need for legislation to end smoking in all workplaces and enclosed public places .
it said such a ban would cut smoking rates from about one in four adults to one in five .
the government is currently carrying out a consultation on plans to ban smoking in the majority of public places by the end of 2008 - but it is planned to exempt pubs not preparing and serving food .
deaths smoking is the main cause of preventable death in the uk - killing more than 100,000 people a year .
opinion polls show that the majority of people in britain want a choice of smoking and no-smoking rooms in pubs simon clark inhaling other people 's smoke in the workplace has been estimated to cause 600 premature deaths a year , but these figures are disputed by the pro-smoking lobby .
deborah arnott , of the charity action on smoking and health , said : " some councils have led the way to encourage smokefree workplaces and public places in their area , and to help cut the terrible toll of death and disease caused by smoking .
" but too many councils are still doing little or nothing to promote smoke freedom .
" too many still do not realize the impact that smoking has on life expectancy and health inequalities in their areas . "
david rogers , chairman of the well-being board of the local government association , said the roll of councils was limited until they were given new enforcement powers by the government .
new campaign smokefree action has been launched by a coalition of groups including asthma uk , the british heart foundation , the british medical association , cancer research uk , the chartered institute of environmental health and the royal college of physicians .
it is campaigning for a comprehensive smokefree law covering all workplaces and enclosed public places across england , wales and northern ireland .
such a law is already in place in ireland and was last week approved by the scottish parliament .
professor alex markham , chief executive of cancer research uk , said : " all workers have a right to work in a smokefree environment , and a comprehensive ban on smoking in enclosed public places - without exemptions - is the only practical way we can give them the protection they deserve . "
no support however , simon clark , director of the smokers ' lobby group forest , described the new coalition as " the usual rag-bag collection of professional anti-smokers re-packaged and re-branded " .
he said : " opinion polls show that the majority of people in britain want a choice of smoking and no-smoking rooms in pubs , clubs and bars with better ventilation to improve air quality .
" to say that the evidence supporting smokefree workplaces is now so strong that there is no room left for scientific debate is breathtakingly arrogant and completely untrue .
" there is no conclusive evidence that passive smoking is a cause of ill health . "

it found some councils - such as liverpool , manchester , poole and sheffield - were pushing for smokefree work places and enclosed public areas .
but most were still doing little more than banning smoking in their own offices .
too many councils are still doing little or nothing to promote smoke freedom deborah arnott only a quarter of all councils - 99 out of 401 - were actively working with nhs primary care trusts and others to promote smokefree public places .
in london , just two out of 33 councils were taking action .
smokefree action said the survey showed the urgent need for legislation to end smoking in all workplaces and enclosed public places .
it said such a ban would cut smoking rates from about one in four adults to one in five .
the government is currently carrying out a consultation on plans to ban smoking in the majority of public places by the end of 2008 - but it is planned to exempt pubs not preparing and serving food .
deaths smoking is the main cause of preventable death in the uk - killing more than 100,000 people a year .
opinion polls show that the majority of people in britain want a choice of smoking and no-smoking rooms in pubs simon clark inhaling other people 's smoke in the workplace has been estimated to cause 600 premature deaths a year , but these figures are disputed by the pro-smoking lobby .
deborah arnott , of the charity action on smoking and health , said : " some councils have led the way to encourage smokefree workplaces and public places in their area , and to help cut the terrible toll of death and disease caused by smoking .
" but too many councils are still doing little or nothing to promote smoke freedom .
" too many still do not realize the impact that smoking has on life expectancy and health inequalities in their areas . "
david rogers , chairman of the well-being board of the local government association , said the roll of councils was limited until they were given new enforcement powers by the government .
new campaign smokefree action has been launched by a coalition of groups including asthma uk , the british heart foundation , the british medical association , cancer research uk , the chartered institute of environmental health and the royal college of physicians .
it is campaigning for a comprehensive smokefree law covering all workplaces and enclosed public places across england , wales and northern ireland .
such a law is already in place in ireland and was last week approved by the scottish parliament .
professor alex markham , chief executive of cancer research uk , said : " all workers have a right to work in a smokefree environment , and a comprehensive ban on smoking in enclosed public places - without exemptions - is the only practical way we can give them the protection they deserve . "
no support however , simon clark , director of the smokers ' lobby group forest , described the new coalition as " the usual rag-bag collection of professional anti-smokers re-packaged and re-branded " .
he said : " opinion polls show that the majority of people in britain want a choice of smoking and no-smoking rooms in pubs , clubs and bars with better ventilation to improve air quality .
" to say that the evidence supporting smokefree workplaces is now so strong that there is no room left for scientific debate is breathtakingly arrogant and completely untrue .
" there is no conclusive evidence that passive smoking is a cause of ill health . "

by the afternoon , the streets of velez-blanco are empty online diaries , or weblogs , come in all shapes and sizes .
some are intensely personal ; others are very political .
sokari ekine 's blog is both , and that is just the way she likes it .
ms ekine blogs from velez-blanco , a village of about 2,500 people , which sits on the side of a mountain in southern spain .
in the hot mid-day sun , the whitewashed houses gleam .
cars , motorcycles , street vendors , and tourists all fight for space in the town 's narrow alleys and lanes .
but by one in the afternoon , the heat has forced just about everyone off the streets , and the only sound to be heard in velez-blanco 's main square is the village fountain , where residents can get their water .
the quiet , rural life is what drew sokari ekine here .
she and her partner own a house and a bit of land just outside of velez-blanco .
as she strolls on the path between the newly planted potatoes and cherry trees , ms ekine talks about how different her life was in london five years ago .
" i had been thinking about leaving britain for a number of years , " she says .
" what kind of spurred me on is that in 2000 , i had cancer .
and after the treatment and everything , i decided that now was a good enough time to make a move , get away from the pollution , the stress and everything else , to completely downsize myself . "
globe trotter ms ekine has been on the move from a young age .
she was born and raised in nigeria , the daughter of a nigerian father and british mother .
from early on , ekine 's been interested in the latest technology .
there is nothing in this blog that says this is about africa , or african women , but that 's where i 'm focusing sofari ekine " just to age myself , the first computer given to me was something called an osbourne , " ms ekine says laughing .
" then i got a sinclair , and all those funny things that lasted about six months .
in fact , you were probably still in your nappies when i was playing with my osbourne . "
ms ekine went to college in england .
she then lived in the us for a few years , before returning to britain , and then eventually moving on to spain .
she has worked as both an academic and an activist , focusing mainly on feminist issues and gender issues .
ekine 's also taken an interest in the violence in the oil-rich niger delta region of nigeria .
those diverse interests started to gel in january 2004 , just after she and her partner moved to spain .
that is when she first thought about starting a blog .
" i had been watching the technology , because one of the first things we got when we first got here was the internet , because we needed to be able to communicate with family .
" and at some point in time , i thought , well , let me see if i could do something .
but i did n't know what , " she recalls .
gay life in africa her first two attempts at blogging were not successful .
she says they were too unfocused .
but she soon figured it out .
sokari ekine blogs about the treatment of women in africa ms ekine started a blog called black looks , the musings and rants of an african fem .
" there is nothing in this blog that says this is about africa , or african women , but that 's where i 'm focusing , " she explains .
she pulls no punches , especially when it comes to posts on violence in nigeria , or gay life on the continent .
" i think it 's important to talk about gay and lesbian issues in africa , " she says .
" i do know that there are a lot of gays and lesbians active in africa , and a lot of straight people working with them .
having said that , africa is a very homophobic continent . "
black looks has struck a chord among those hungry for news and comment about such issues in africa .
many bloggers around the world now link to it , and readership has grown .
surprise success ms ekine admits her strong views do sometimes draw criticism from other bloggers .
nigerians often respond angrily to her posts on politics and economics in her homeland , and american bloggers sometimes take a dim view of her posts about the us .
sofari ekine moved to spain in january 2004 " i have one particular blogger who always says , ' oh , you hate americans , " ' she says .
" and i always say , ' look , can we just get away from that ? '
i do not hate anybody , and i certainly do n't hate americans .
i think sometimes people forget that you 're criticising in order to build up and make a change , to transform . "
the success of black looks has caught sokari ekine by surprise .
she says she is finding it hard to keep up with the pressure to find stories to comment on every day .
and with summer here , she really needs to tend her crops , not her blog .
still , she has started a separate blog about the use of technology in africa .
and she is trying to get more bloggers , especially in africa , to contribute to black looks .
that way people might learn more about the daily lives of africans , and she will have more time to pick the cherries that are already ripe on the trees outside .

by the afternoon , the streets of velez-blanco are empty online diaries , or weblogs , come in all shapes and sizes .
some are intensely personal ; others are very political .
sokari ekine 's blog is both , and that is just the way she likes it .
ms ekine blogs from velez-blanco , a village of about 2,500 people , which sits on the side of a mountain in southern spain .
in the hot mid-day sun , the whitewashed houses gleam .
cars , motorcycles , street vendors , and tourists all fight for space in the town 's narrow alleys and lanes .
but by one in the afternoon , the heat has forced just about everyone off the streets , and the only sound to be heard in velez-blanco 's main square is the village fountain , where residents can get their water .
the quiet , rural life is what drew sokari ekine here .
she and her partner own a house and a bit of land just outside of velez-blanco .
as she strolls on the path between the newly planted potatoes and cherry trees , ms ekine talks about how different her life was in london five years ago .
" i had been thinking about leaving britain for a number of years , " she says .
" what kind of spurred me on is that in 2000 , i had cancer .
and after the treatment and everything , i decided that now was a good enough time to make a move , get away from the pollution , the stress and everything else , to completely downsize myself . "
globe trotter ms ekine has been on the move from a young age .
she was born and raised in nigeria , the daughter of a nigerian father and british mother .
from early on , ekine 's been interested in the latest technology .
there is nothing in this blog that says this is about africa , or african women , but that 's where i 'm focusing sofari ekine " just to age myself , the first computer given to me was something called an osbourne , " ms ekine says laughing .
" then i got a sinclair , and all those funny things that lasted about six months .
in fact , you were probably still in your nappies when i was playing with my osbourne . "
ms ekine went to college in england .
she then lived in the us for a few years , before returning to britain , and then eventually moving on to spain .
she has worked as both an academic and an activist , focusing mainly on feminist issues and gender issues .
ekine 's also taken an interest in the violence in the oil-rich niger delta region of nigeria .
those diverse interests started to gel in january 2004 , just after she and her partner moved to spain .
that is when she first thought about starting a blog .
" i had been watching the technology , because one of the first things we got when we first got here was the internet , because we needed to be able to communicate with family .
" and at some point in time , i thought , well , let me see if i could do something .
but i did n't know what , " she recalls .
gay life in africa her first two attempts at blogging were not successful .
she says they were too unfocused .
but she soon figured it out .
sokari ekine blogs about the treatment of women in africa ms ekine started a blog called black looks , the musings and rants of an african fem .
" there is nothing in this blog that says this is about africa , or african women , but that 's where i 'm focusing , " she explains .
she pulls no punches , especially when it comes to posts on violence in nigeria , or gay life on the continent .
" i think it 's important to talk about gay and lesbian issues in africa , " she says .
" i do know that there are a lot of gays and lesbians active in africa , and a lot of straight people working with them .
having said that , africa is a very homophobic continent . "
black looks has struck a chord among those hungry for news and comment about such issues in africa .
many bloggers around the world now link to it , and readership has grown .
surprise success ms ekine admits her strong views do sometimes draw criticism from other bloggers .
nigerians often respond angrily to her posts on politics and economics in her homeland , and american bloggers sometimes take a dim view of her posts about the us .
sofari ekine moved to spain in january 2004 " i have one particular blogger who always says , ' oh , you hate americans , " ' she says .
" and i always say , ' look , can we just get away from that ? '
i do not hate anybody , and i certainly do n't hate americans .
i think sometimes people forget that you 're criticising in order to build up and make a change , to transform . "
the success of black looks has caught sokari ekine by surprise .
she says she is finding it hard to keep up with the pressure to find stories to comment on every day .
and with summer here , she really needs to tend her crops , not her blog .
still , she has started a separate blog about the use of technology in africa .
and she is trying to get more bloggers , especially in africa , to contribute to black looks .
that way people might learn more about the daily lives of africans , and she will have more time to pick the cherries that are already ripe on the trees outside .

by the afternoon , the streets of velez-blanco are empty online diaries , or weblogs , come in all shapes and sizes .
some are intensely personal ; others are very political .
sokari ekine 's blog is both , and that is just the way she likes it .
ms ekine blogs from velez-blanco , a village of about 2,500 people , which sits on the side of a mountain in southern spain .
in the hot mid-day sun , the whitewashed houses gleam .
cars , motorcycles , street vendors , and tourists all fight for space in the town 's narrow alleys and lanes .
but by one in the afternoon , the heat has forced just about everyone off the streets , and the only sound to be heard in velez-blanco 's main square is the village fountain , where residents can get their water .
the quiet , rural life is what drew sokari ekine here .
she and her partner own a house and a bit of land just outside of velez-blanco .
as she strolls on the path between the newly planted potatoes and cherry trees , ms ekine talks about how different her life was in london five years ago .
" i had been thinking about leaving britain for a number of years , " she says .
" what kind of spurred me on is that in 2000 , i had cancer .
and after the treatment and everything , i decided that now was a good enough time to make a move , get away from the pollution , the stress and everything else , to completely downsize myself . "
globe trotter ms ekine has been on the move from a young age .
she was born and raised in nigeria , the daughter of a nigerian father and british mother .
from early on , ekine 's been interested in the latest technology .
there is nothing in this blog that says this is about africa , or african women , but that 's where i 'm focusing sofari ekine " just to age myself , the first computer given to me was something called an osbourne , " ms ekine says laughing .
" then i got a sinclair , and all those funny things that lasted about six months .
in fact , you were probably still in your nappies when i was playing with my osbourne . "
ms ekine went to college in england .
she then lived in the us for a few years , before returning to britain , and then eventually moving on to spain .
she has worked as both an academic and an activist , focusing mainly on feminist issues and gender issues .
ekine 's also taken an interest in the violence in the oil-rich niger delta region of nigeria .
those diverse interests started to gel in january 2004 , just after she and her partner moved to spain .
that is when she first thought about starting a blog .
" i had been watching the technology , because one of the first things we got when we first got here was the internet , because we needed to be able to communicate with family .
" and at some point in time , i thought , well , let me see if i could do something .
but i did n't know what , " she recalls .
gay life in africa her first two attempts at blogging were not successful .
she says they were too unfocused .
but she soon figured it out .
sokari ekine blogs about the treatment of women in africa ms ekine started a blog called black looks , the musings and rants of an african fem .
" there is nothing in this blog that says this is about africa , or african women , but that 's where i 'm focusing , " she explains .
she pulls no punches , especially when it comes to posts on violence in nigeria , or gay life on the continent .
" i think it 's important to talk about gay and lesbian issues in africa , " she says .
" i do know that there are a lot of gays and lesbians active in africa , and a lot of straight people working with them .
having said that , africa is a very homophobic continent . "
black looks has struck a chord among those hungry for news and comment about such issues in africa .
many bloggers around the world now link to it , and readership has grown .
surprise success ms ekine admits her strong views do sometimes draw criticism from other bloggers .
nigerians often respond angrily to her posts on politics and economics in her homeland , and american bloggers sometimes take a dim view of her posts about the us .
sofari ekine moved to spain in january 2004 " i have one particular blogger who always says , ' oh , you hate americans , " ' she says .
" and i always say , ' look , can we just get away from that ? '
i do not hate anybody , and i certainly do n't hate americans .
i think sometimes people forget that you 're criticising in order to build up and make a change , to transform . "
the success of black looks has caught sokari ekine by surprise .
she says she is finding it hard to keep up with the pressure to find stories to comment on every day .
and with summer here , she really needs to tend her crops , not her blog .
still , she has started a separate blog about the use of technology in africa .
and she is trying to get more bloggers , especially in africa , to contribute to black looks .
that way people might learn more about the daily lives of africans , and she will have more time to pick the cherries that are already ripe on the trees outside .
