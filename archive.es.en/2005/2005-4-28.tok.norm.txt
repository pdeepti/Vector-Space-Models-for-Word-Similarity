but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .

bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .
i just do n't like houses with thin walls .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .

that 's got his club managers in munich upset . bundesliga leaders bayern munich have reacted angrily to comments from german national team manager oliver bierhoff advising sebastian deisler to leave munich as a way of kick-starting his ailing career and getting more playing time before the 2006 world cup .
bierhoff said he was interested in seeing more from deisler and that that midfielder has n't been excluded from the list of possibilities for this summer 's confederations cup .
" i would n't go so far as to say that he wo n't be on the team , " bierhoff said .
" the trainers think a lot of him and naturally regret that he plays very little at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern midfielder sebastian deisler no word from deisler deisler -lrb- photo -rrb- himself has admitted he would like to be included on the confederations cup roster , but decided not to comment on his playing time at bayern .
hamburg sv is rumored to be a potential destination .
the team acknowledged it would be willing to shuffle its lineup to welcome the national team player in a central role .
" it 's a good suggestion , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf told reporters .
" deisler would fit in well with us . "
none of bierhoff 's business his current employer , however , had plenty to say about the intrusion of national team politics on its club decisions .
" i want to be very clear that the bayern team selection is the sole responsibility of manager felix magath , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge told a munich newspaper .
" everyone has their own responsibilities and mr. klinsmann along with mr. bierhoff should accept that and not tell us what to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler , left , has started seven games for munich this season .
regardless of the fact that deisler has started just seven games for bayern this season , some in munich are quite possessive of the benched midfielder who was plagued last season with injury and bouts of depression and burnout .
" he is one of our players and it will stay that way , " bayern spokesperson markus hörwick said .
without making as brash a suggestion as bierhoff , bayern munich president and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer threw his support behind deisler and said the short substitutions are n't helping deisler , who needs longer " to get some continuity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether deisler makes the national team in next summer 's world cup is far from decided .
important role in world cup in addition to support from beckenbauer , deisler may also have good reason to want to stay in the bavarian capital .
magath told die welt newspaper on thursday he wants to see deisler play in the confederations cup and agreed to " work together so that he plays an important role in the world cup next year . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.04.2005 germany manager provokes deisler row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bierhoff angered bayern over his remarks about sebastian deisler bayern 's sebastian deisler has a couple of influential supporters , including oliver bierhoff and franz beckenbauer , who want to see the midfielder get more playing time .
that 's got his club managers in munich upset . bundesliga leaders bayern munich have reacted angrily to comments from german national team manager oliver bierhoff advising sebastian deisler to leave munich as a way of kick-starting his ailing career and getting more playing time before the 2006 world cup .
bierhoff said he was interested in seeing more from deisler and that that midfielder has n't been excluded from the list of possibilities for this summer 's confederations cup .
" i would n't go so far as to say that he wo n't be on the team , " bierhoff said .
" the trainers think a lot of him and naturally regret that he plays very little at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern midfielder sebastian deisler no word from deisler deisler -lrb- photo -rrb- himself has admitted he would like to be included on the confederations cup roster , but decided not to comment on his playing time at bayern .
hamburg sv is rumored to be a potential destination .
the team acknowledged it would be willing to shuffle its lineup to welcome the national team player in a central role .
" it 's a good suggestion , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf told reporters .
" deisler would fit in well with us . "
none of bierhoff 's business his current employer , however , had plenty to say about the intrusion of national team politics on its club decisions .
" i want to be very clear that the bayern team selection is the sole responsibility of manager felix magath , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge told a munich newspaper .
" everyone has their own responsibilities and mr. klinsmann along with mr. bierhoff should accept that and not tell us what to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler , left , has started seven games for munich this season .
regardless of the fact that deisler has started just seven games for bayern this season , some in munich are quite possessive of the benched midfielder who was plagued last season with injury and bouts of depression and burnout .
" he is one of our players and it will stay that way , " bayern spokesperson markus hörwick said .
without making as brash a suggestion as bierhoff , bayern munich president and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer threw his support behind deisler and said the short substitutions are n't helping deisler , who needs longer " to get some continuity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether deisler makes the national team in next summer 's world cup is far from decided .
important role in world cup in addition to support from beckenbauer , deisler may also have good reason to want to stay in the bavarian capital .
magath told die welt newspaper on thursday he wants to see deisler play in the confederations cup and agreed to " work together so that he plays an important role in the world cup next year . "

" if there is a way of resolving this short of applying sanctions , it should be taken , " wto spokesman keith rockwell told afp .
" two months of data are not sufficient to make a true assessment . " the wto 's plea came as the european union 's executive commission was ready to decide on thursday whether to launch a probe into surging chinese clothing imports , in an escalating trade dispute with the asian economic giant . an investigation - which would mark the first step towards formal limits on some chinese clothing imports - comes amid mounting pressure for action from some eu states , led by france and italy , but also growing warnings about the fallout from a potential trade war .
an eu spokesman told afp that brussels also considered the probe an opportunity to talk the issue over with beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed to wto ?
beijing , meanwhile , is calling the move " a big mistake . " a official announcement on the decision is expected friday . worried over jobs eu textile producers are worried that thousands of jobs could be lost if urgent action is not taken to hold back a flood of chinese clothing that was unleashed by the end of a 31-year-old global textiles quota system on january 1 . chinese textile imports into the eu have soared by as much as 534 percent for some garments since the end of the quota system , which is far beyond limits the commission considers tolerable . normally , launching an investigation would open a 60-day period during which informal consultations are to be held between brussels and beijing to try to find a solution .
but if the eu goes ahead with emergency procedures , the process would more quickly to a much more serious formal consultation period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading the charge french foreign minister jean-pierre raffarin told french television channel france 2 : " there is a real problem and i think that the chinese should acknowledge it and that we find a solution in dialogue straight away and , if necessary , by safeguard measures in the coming weeks .

" this is bigger than just textiles , " said john weekes , a trade consultant and former canadian ambassador to the wto .
" it does provide a test of the wto .
this is a challenge that ca n't be avoided but one that , if managed well , can show the importance of the organization .

" if there is a way of resolving this short of applying sanctions , it should be taken , " wto spokesman keith rockwell told afp .
" two months of data are not sufficient to make a true assessment . " the wto 's plea came as the european union 's executive commission was ready to decide on thursday whether to launch a probe into surging chinese clothing imports , in an escalating trade dispute with the asian economic giant . an investigation - which would mark the first step towards formal limits on some chinese clothing imports - comes amid mounting pressure for action from some eu states , led by france and italy , but also growing warnings about the fallout from a potential trade war .
an eu spokesman told afp that brussels also considered the probe an opportunity to talk the issue over with beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed to wto ?
beijing , meanwhile , is calling the move " a big mistake . " a official announcement on the decision is expected friday . worried over jobs eu textile producers are worried that thousands of jobs could be lost if urgent action is not taken to hold back a flood of chinese clothing that was unleashed by the end of a 31-year-old global textiles quota system on january 1 . chinese textile imports into the eu have soared by as much as 534 percent for some garments since the end of the quota system , which is far beyond limits the commission considers tolerable . normally , launching an investigation would open a 60-day period during which informal consultations are to be held between brussels and beijing to try to find a solution .
but if the eu goes ahead with emergency procedures , the process would more quickly to a much more serious formal consultation period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading the charge french foreign minister jean-pierre raffarin told french television channel france 2 : " there is a real problem and i think that the chinese should acknowledge it and that we find a solution in dialogue straight away and , if necessary , by safeguard measures in the coming weeks . " proving material injury the two sides are bound by wto rules which limit the actions member states can take to temporarily protect domestic producers , as well as the agreement on china 's accession to the wto in 2001 . when china joined the organization , it accepted that a trading partner could place a temporary cap on its textile and clothing imports from the moment talks were requested . under wto rules , the eu must first prove claims of " material injury " to its own producers , and that that injury is caused by chinese imports , before it can levy temporary trade barriers on some products . with the us also conducting a review of chinese textile imports , the wto is likely to end up arbitrating between trade titans if china formally objects to any safeguard measures , experts said . " this is bigger than just textiles , " said john weekes , a trade consultant and former canadian ambassador to the wto .
" it does provide a test of the wto .
this is a challenge that ca n't be avoided but one that , if managed well , can show the importance of the organization . " warning of fallout meanwhile , in bangkok during an asian trip , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson urged european manufacturers calling for limits on chinese textiles to consider the possible fallout on other companies . " i have to be mindful of all those european interests , " he said in a press conference .
" it does n't work one way , you have to see both sides of the coin , and i hope that those who are debating this issue and representing industrial interests will bear in mind that there is more than one set of european interests in this question . " mandelson told reporters during his first official visit to thailand that while some europe-based manufacturers wanted safeguards , european firms with factories in china exporting to the eu would not welcome them . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , china at loggerheads over textiles the eu 's textile producers are expected to call on the european commission to launch emergency measures to limit booming chinese imports .
beijing has expressed displeasure and warned that bilateral ties could suffer .

german officials are not best pleased and are considering legal action .
it is , however , a very gray area . the organizers of the 2006 world cup finals in germany are furious after tickets found their way on to the black market just 48 hours after the first sales period ended . the lucky recipients of the initial batch of tickets had hardly had time to comprehend that they were going to the world cup when it was reported that the first offers for resale appeared on the internet auction portal ebay , an unwelcome development the world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- had feared all along . the ok had gone to great lengths to ensure tickets were purchased through the proper channels but , even though it was resigned to the fact that resales would happen , the members of the committee were caught out by the speed of the development and what to do about it . " this is the sort of thing we were keen to avoid , " ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" we will take all the legal measures we can to combat it . " committee advises fans not to buy auction tickets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst r. schmidt schmidt confirmed that the ok had asked ebay not to sell world cup tickets but the two had failed to come to an agreement .
" i can only advise the fans not to buy tickets via an auction , " said schmidt .
" there are still a lot of tickets on offer . "
in total 2.93 million tickets are on sale to the general public and only the first batch of 812,000 tickets have been sold with four more sales periods still to come . but the ok and football 's governing body fifa have been inundated with e-mails complaining about the shortage of tickets available to football fans and with demand outstripping supply many fans have turned to the black market . however , those supporters hoping to beat the complicated system by purchasing world cup tickets may find out that ultimately they are operating in a false economy .
the lucky bidders may be getting cheaper , easier-to-buy tickets but when it comes to match day , they may be barred from entering the stadium . tickets may lead to refused entry " fans obtaining tickets in this way may find themselves denied admission at the turnstiles .
everyone knows that tickets are personalized and can not be transferred without a genuinely pressing reason , and then only with the organizing committee 's approval , " schmidt told the official fifa world cup web site . " there could be problems if the ticket and personal id fail to match , exactly as there would be with an airline ticket .
we 've said it often enough before , and we 're saying it again : tickets are only transferable for good reasons - and profiteering is n't a good reason . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 euro , amtlicher höchstpreis für ein ticket für das finalspiel der fußball-wm 2006 , liegen auf einer zeitschrift , in der die wm-spielstätten vorgestellt werden , illustration vom 31.01.2005 .
am dienstag -lrb- 01.02.2005 -rrb- fällt der startschuss zum verkauf der eintrittskarten für die fifa fussball-weltmeisterschaft 2006 .

märz 2005 karten für alle 64 wm-spiele geordert werden .
foto : peter endig / lsn + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + the ok is also concerned that supporters are paying over the odds for tickets through other channels than the official one .
tickets via the fifa portal start at 35 euros , rising to 600 euros for the most expensive ticket at the final .
tickets being sold on ebay are going for between 800 and 1,000 euros for a match in the last sixteen . ebay unsure of what laws have been broken the committee is now considering taking legal action as the official terms and conditions of sale have , it claims , been breached , and copyrights infringed .
" the people making these offers do not have the right to transfer tickets allocated to them to third parties , " schmidt added . but there is some debate whether the resale of tickets on ebay is illegal .
the operators of the online auction portal are demanding more details as to which laws or regulations it may have broken and what the future implications might be .
the case becomes even more complicated given that the company works across various borders .
ebay also sells used or expired tickets which are bought in the manner of stamps .
presently ebay.de rules do not inhibit any " live " ticket sales and , therefore , present sellers fall within the rules of the site .
whether they are within the state laws would be up to a court - should any case get that far . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup ticket lottery hits fever pitch thousands of soccer fans received a little electronic message of joy on friday , as e-mails from fifa told them they had made the cut for world cup match tickets .

hans-hermann wendhausen , a member of the regional parliament in the northern state of lower saxony , agreed to refund 422,954 euros and his parliamentary colleague ingolf viereck will pay back 343,519 euros .
both had received the payments from volkswagen over a ten-year period , said the speaker of the lower saxony parliament , jürgen gansäuer .
they will make the payments to the state parliament which will then decide what to do with the money .
it is believed to be the first time german politicians have ever paid back money received from companies .
the state laws of lower saxony allow politicians to receive additional income alongside their salaries as long as they are actually providing a service to a company .
but the two politicians in this case were forced to refund the money because they were no longer working for volkswagen when they received the payments .
the practice of bankrolling politicians came to a head in december when the secretary general of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , laurenz meyer , resigned after admitting he had received 59,320 euros -lrb- $ 78,500 -rrb- from energy giant rwe . dw-world.de german opposition deputy resigns german opposition leader angela merkel 's deputy , laurenz meyer , resigned on wednesday after being heavily criticized for failing to fully declare payments and electricity subsidies he received from his former employer .

but the revised numbers showed on thursday that third-quarter gdp contracted by a fractional 0.04 percent , while fourth-quarter gdp declined by 0.1 percent .
the last time germany was in recession was in the final quarter of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003 .
nevertheless , german growth looks set for a technical rebound in the first quarter of 2005 .

the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .

the jewish community association in the southern state of bavaria said it was insensitive to choose the date to pay tribute to nazi victims , adding that its members would not participate in the official ceremony .
" there is a total ban on driving for jews on this high holiday , " association president josef schuster told the dpa news agency , adding that riding in a car or leaving one 's town were also prohibited under jewish law .
schuster said the international dachau committee , comprised largely of camp survivors , had been informed of the problem one year ago but refused to change the date .
" that is very regrettable , particularly because jews represent a significant number of the victims , " schuster said .
he said the jewish community would hold its own ceremony may 5 at dachau 's jewish memorial .
camp survivors and officials from across europe are to gather at the camp sunday to mark its liberation by american troops on april 29 , 1945 as world war ii drew to a close .
between 1933 and 1945 , more than 200,000 people from 38 countries and across the religious spectrum were held by the nazis under appalling conditions .
at least 30,000 people were killed , starved or died of disease there . dw-world.de camp survivors recall horror and freedom hundreds of nazi concentration camp survivors from around the world marked the 60th anniversary of their liberation over the weekend as they mourned the millions who lost their lives .

if the league-leading bavarians win away saturday against fc kaiserslautern , which has lost four of its last five games , they 'll clinch the league 's top spot with four matches left in the season .
schalke 04 , sitting just below munich in the rankings , is aiming to put an end to the slide that has seen it bury its championship hopes and start getting nervous about its champions league chances next season .
second 's not so bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the shots have n't gone schalke 's way recently " we are second and a lot of teams would like to be in our position , " schalke coach ralf rangnick said last week .
" i told the players that it is up to them whether they play in the champions league or uefa cup next season . "
a win at home against seventh place bayer leverkusen would go a long way in calming the team 's nerves and , schalke hopes , put some space between it and third place vfb stuttgart , which is just one point behind the royal blues .
leverkusen , however , has been playing well of late , most recently with a 3-1 win over werder bremen , last year 's german champions .
that seems to have made schalke nervous .
yesterday rangnick took his team to a secret location for some last-minute practice .

vfb suffered an embarrassing loss to hansa rostock two weeks ago and played to a scoreless tie at home last week against wolfsburg .
berlin 's european chances strengthen after a 4-1 win last week against schalke , european opportunities have opened up for hertha berlin , currently in fourth place .
riding a wave of three straight victories , berlin travels to rostock , where everything points to another win for the capital team whose last lost to rostock came in 1997 .
self-criticism seems to be in style with fifth place werder bremen , which will try to fend off 11th place arminia bielefeld this weekend .
bremen 's sports director , klaus allofs , declared that his team " is no longer a top team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen have n't had a lot to celebrate of late in the bundesliga bielefeld looks like it will finish in the middle of the table this season .
the team could be hoping that fresh faces bring better results next season after signing transfer deals that see matthias langkamp off to wolfsburg and delron buckley heading to dortmund .
hamburg counting points confidence has n't been lacking in hamburg , another european play contender on bremen 's heels , before its visit to wolfsburg on sunday .
" we have better quality than our last four opponents and can set 12 points as a goal , " said hamburg 's belgian striker emile mpenza .

the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .

the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .

the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .

the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .

it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .
i just do n't like houses with thin walls .

the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .

the jewish community association in the southern state of bavaria said it was insensitive to choose the date to pay tribute to nazi victims , adding that its members would not participate in the official ceremony .
" there is a total ban on driving for jews on this high holiday , " association president josef schuster told the dpa news agency , adding that riding in a car or leaving one 's town were also prohibited under jewish law .
schuster said the international dachau committee , comprised largely of camp survivors , had been informed of the problem one year ago but refused to change the date .
" that is very regrettable , particularly because jews represent a significant number of the victims , " schuster said .
he said the jewish community would hold its own ceremony may 5 at dachau 's jewish memorial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2005 picking designer homes off the rack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star viennese architect peichl designed this single family home the tarnished image of prefabricated housing may be getting a shine in germany , with a rash of ultra-modern designs on the market .
but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .
i just do n't like houses with thin walls .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .
i just do n't like houses with thin walls .

how can young people maintain their own personalities amidst all the commercial noise ?
the exhibition " coolhunters " shows that youngsters are not just victims of consumerism . young germans live in a highly commercial and media driven world , that at least the idea conveyed in a new exhibition at what the karlsruhe city gallery . television and the internet are crammed with advertising slogans , and upon being asked what they want to be when they are older , a staggering number of kids reply " rich and famous " .
perhaps that 's not surprising given that they 're surrounded by television and music teen success stories . there 's no question that today 's society is a consumer 's paradise .
young people are top targets for banks and the like who rate naivety as a key to highly profitable interest .
21st century youngsters are in fact growing up immersed in unprecedented levels of debt . bildunterschrift : alex mcquilkin " aye , me -lrb- heart explosion -rrb- 1 " , 2004 swept up in the general whirlwind of light-hearted spending , they sink the money they do n't have into cell phone bills , the latest in high-street fashion and mainstream lifestyle accessories they think they need to shore up their existance in the modern world .
in short , they buy their identity , and the price is high .
defining yourself but sabine himmelsbach , who is curator of the exhibition , says not much has changed for this generation of youngsters .
" they are faced with the same questions , such as " how do i define myself ?
how do i carve an identity for myself in society ? "
yet she says the market has become a more dominant force " what we are doing is showing the whole spectrum and proving that youngsters deal with the situation in a critical way . "
the exhibition clearly emphasises the fact that young people are not just victims of the consumer world , but that they contribute to its creation .
one example of such is called ad-busting , in which well-known slogans or brand names are slightly altered turning " snickers " into " suckers " and " t-mobile " into " t-error " . bildunterschrift : andreas gursky " union rave " , 1995 the exhibition in karlsruhe looks at youth culture from many different angles , and comprises videos and objects relating to six subjects : body , language , space , time , gender and violence . what language do young people today speak ?
and how do they construct an identity or a profile , as it is more commonly known today .
what role do clothes , computer games and the internet play ?
how influential is television violence ?
the questions are endless .
the answers too . the show tries to let young people and their objects speak for themselves rather than citing studies and statistics .
there are countless pairs of jeans , t-shirts , underwear and caps , a collection of skateboards and sneakers , and even the essential accessories of the modern-day goth . youth culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pips : lab " luma2solator " , 2004 in keeping with the times , the exhibition 's internet site shows a collection of work , including photos , paintings , interviews and short films by school children and students on the subject of youth culture . young people are the trendsetters in society , they are the ones who best know how to navigate the maze of new media , and for many bright young things , hacking game codes and firewalls is not just fun , but also a route towards creating an identity . coolhunters .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .

daimlerchrysler said in a statement it booked net profit of 288 million euros -lrb- $ 374 million -rrb- in the period from january to march , down 30 percent from the year-earlier figure .
operating profit slid by 59 percent to 628 million euros and sales were down two percent at 31.74 billion euros in the january-march period .
the car giant blamed its loss-making smart car for its troubles .

that 's got his club managers in munich upset . bundesliga leaders bayern munich have reacted angrily to comments from german national team manager oliver bierhoff advising sebastian deisler to leave munich as a way of kick-starting his ailing career and getting more playing time before the 2006 world cup .
bierhoff said he was interested in seeing more from deisler and that that midfielder has n't been excluded from the list of possibilities for this summer 's confederations cup .
" i would n't go so far as to say that he wo n't be on the team , " bierhoff said .
" the trainers think a lot of him and naturally regret that he plays very little at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern midfielder sebastian deisler no word from deisler deisler -lrb- photo -rrb- himself has admitted he would like to be included on the confederations cup roster , but decided not to comment on his playing time at bayern .
hamburg sv is rumored to be a potential destination .
the team acknowledged it would be willing to shuffle its lineup to welcome the national team player in a central role .
" it 's a good suggestion , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf told reporters .
" deisler would fit in well with us . "
none of bierhoff 's business his current employer , however , had plenty to say about the intrusion of national team politics on its club decisions .
" i want to be very clear that the bayern team selection is the sole responsibility of manager felix magath , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge told a munich newspaper .
" everyone has their own responsibilities and mr. klinsmann along with mr. bierhoff should accept that and not tell us what to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler , left , has started seven games for munich this season .
regardless of the fact that deisler has started just seven games for bayern this season , some in munich are quite possessive of the benched midfielder who was plagued last season with injury and bouts of depression and burnout .
" he is one of our players and it will stay that way , " bayern spokesperson markus hörwick said .
without making as brash a suggestion as bierhoff , bayern munich president and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer threw his support behind deisler and said the short substitutions are n't helping deisler , who needs longer " to get some continuity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether deisler makes the national team in next summer 's world cup is far from decided .
important role in world cup in addition to support from beckenbauer , deisler may also have good reason to want to stay in the bavarian capital .
magath told die welt newspaper on thursday he wants to see deisler play in the confederations cup and agreed to " work together so that he plays an important role in the world cup next year . "
the deisler affair is not the first time bayern has failed to see eye-to-eye with german national coach klinsmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.04.2005 court rejects german eu referendum plea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder signed it , now it 's parliament 's turn to ratify it the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest court , has rejected a legal plea for a popular vote on the eu constitution thursday .
the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .
the constitution needs to be ratified by all eu member states to become law . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .

german officials are not best pleased and are considering legal action .
it is , however , a very gray area . the organizers of the 2006 world cup finals in germany are furious after tickets found their way on to the black market just 48 hours after the first sales period ended . the lucky recipients of the initial batch of tickets had hardly had time to comprehend that they were going to the world cup when it was reported that the first offers for resale appeared on the internet auction portal ebay , an unwelcome development the world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- had feared all along . the ok had gone to great lengths to ensure tickets were purchased through the proper channels but , even though it was resigned to the fact that resales would happen , the members of the committee were caught out by the speed of the development and what to do about it . " this is the sort of thing we were keen to avoid , " ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" we will take all the legal measures we can to combat it . " committee advises fans not to buy auction tickets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst r. schmidt schmidt confirmed that the ok had asked ebay not to sell world cup tickets but the two had failed to come to an agreement .
" i can only advise the fans not to buy tickets via an auction , " said schmidt .
" there are still a lot of tickets on offer . "
in total 2.93 million tickets are on sale to the general public and only the first batch of 812,000 tickets have been sold with four more sales periods still to come . but the ok and football 's governing body fifa have been inundated with e-mails complaining about the shortage of tickets available to football fans and with demand outstripping supply many fans have turned to the black market . however , those supporters hoping to beat the complicated system by purchasing world cup tickets may find out that ultimately they are operating in a false economy .
the lucky bidders may be getting cheaper , easier-to-buy tickets but when it comes to match day , they may be barred from entering the stadium . tickets may lead to refused entry " fans obtaining tickets in this way may find themselves denied admission at the turnstiles .
everyone knows that tickets are personalized and can not be transferred without a genuinely pressing reason , and then only with the organizing committee 's approval , " schmidt told the official fifa world cup web site . " there could be problems if the ticket and personal id fail to match , exactly as there would be with an airline ticket .
we 've said it often enough before , and we 're saying it again : tickets are only transferable for good reasons - and profiteering is n't a good reason . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 euro , amtlicher höchstpreis für ein ticket für das finalspiel der fußball-wm 2006 , liegen auf einer zeitschrift , in der die wm-spielstätten vorgestellt werden , illustration vom 31.01.2005 .

foto : peter endig / lsn + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + the ok is also concerned that supporters are paying over the odds for tickets through other channels than the official one .
tickets via the fifa portal start at 35 euros , rising to 600 euros for the most expensive ticket at the final .
tickets being sold on ebay are going for between 800 and 1,000 euros for a match in the last sixteen . ebay unsure of what laws have been broken the committee is now considering taking legal action as the official terms and conditions of sale have , it claims , been breached , and copyrights infringed .
" the people making these offers do not have the right to transfer tickets allocated to them to third parties , " schmidt added . but there is some debate whether the resale of tickets on ebay is illegal .
the operators of the online auction portal are demanding more details as to which laws or regulations it may have broken and what the future implications might be .
the case becomes even more complicated given that the company works across various borders .
ebay also sells used or expired tickets which are bought in the manner of stamps .
presently ebay.de rules do not inhibit any " live " ticket sales and , therefore , present sellers fall within the rules of the site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.04.2005 court rejects german eu referendum plea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder signed it , now it 's parliament 's turn to ratify it the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest court , has rejected a legal plea for a popular vote on the eu constitution thursday .
the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.04.2005 germany manager provokes deisler row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver bierhoff angered bayern over his remarks about sebastian deisler bayern 's sebastian deisler has a couple of influential supporters , including oliver bierhoff and franz beckenbauer , who want to see the midfielder get more playing time .
that 's got his club managers in munich upset . bundesliga leaders bayern munich have reacted angrily to comments from german national team manager oliver bierhoff advising sebastian deisler to leave munich as a way of kick-starting his ailing career and getting more playing time before the 2006 world cup .
bierhoff said he was interested in seeing more from deisler and that that midfielder has n't been excluded from the list of possibilities for this summer 's confederations cup .
" i would n't go so far as to say that he wo n't be on the team , " bierhoff said .
" the trainers think a lot of him and naturally regret that he plays very little at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern midfielder sebastian deisler no word from deisler deisler -lrb- photo -rrb- himself has admitted he would like to be included on the confederations cup roster , but decided not to comment on his playing time at bayern .
hamburg sv is rumored to be a potential destination .
the team acknowledged it would be willing to shuffle its lineup to welcome the national team player in a central role .
" it 's a good suggestion , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf told reporters .
" deisler would fit in well with us . "
none of bierhoff 's business his current employer , however , had plenty to say about the intrusion of national team politics on its club decisions .
" i want to be very clear that the bayern team selection is the sole responsibility of manager felix magath , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge told a munich newspaper .
" everyone has their own responsibilities and mr. klinsmann along with mr. bierhoff should accept that and not tell us what to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler , left , has started seven games for munich this season .
regardless of the fact that deisler has started just seven games for bayern this season , some in munich are quite possessive of the benched midfielder who was plagued last season with injury and bouts of depression and burnout .
" he is one of our players and it will stay that way , " bayern spokesperson markus hörwick said .
without making as brash a suggestion as bierhoff , bayern munich president and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer threw his support behind deisler and said the short substitutions are n't helping deisler , who needs longer " to get some continuity . "

it does n't promise to save those on the highway to hell or put the new owner on the expressway to heaven but the modest six year-old vw golf making waves on ebay does have something of the divine about it . according to its current custodian , it is a nice little runner that " is heavenly to drive . "
but it 's not the golf 's performance that is pushing its value through the roof .
it 's the fact that it was once owned by a certain joseph ratzinger , the former cardinal now better known as pope benedict xvi . benjamin halbe got his hands on the private pope-to-be mobile courtesy of a car dealer in january of this year and obviously could not foresee what a desired motor his new car would become three months later . car comes with full service history and a blessing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi has traded his golf in for a new convertible " i had no idea , " said the 21-year-old .
the dealer only told him that the car had been passed onto him with an ecclesiastical blessing .
confused , it was only after halbe had read the service history of his new vehicle that he discovered that one of the former owners had been the pope formerly known as cardinal ratzinger .
" it was only then that i knew what the dealer had been talking about . " for kurt schneider , the car dealer in question , the golf seemed just like another second-hand car passing through his hands from one owner to the next although he did know that it had had a famous driver in its past . benedict xvi a famous back-seat driver the former cardinal ratzinger 's private secretary had long been a customer of the dealership and , although it is well known in church circles that the pope does not have a drivers license , it is believed the golf was used to ferry the holy father-to-be around before at some point in 1999 . halbe looks set to make a heavenly profit on the car .
after paying 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 12,905 -rrb- for the golf at the start of the year , he is likely to more than quadruple that sum by the time the auction runs out in seven days .
the bid at the time of publication was 36,550 euros . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's joseph ratzinger elected pope after initial uncertainty , white smoke rose from the chimney of the sistine chapel indicating the election of a new pope .

the jewish community association in the southern state of bavaria said it was insensitive to choose the date to pay tribute to nazi victims , adding that its members would not participate in the official ceremony .
" there is a total ban on driving for jews on this high holiday , " association president josef schuster told the dpa news agency , adding that riding in a car or leaving one 's town were also prohibited under jewish law .
schuster said the international dachau committee , comprised largely of camp survivors , had been informed of the problem one year ago but refused to change the date .
" that is very regrettable , particularly because jews represent a significant number of the victims , " schuster said .
he said the jewish community would hold its own ceremony may 5 at dachau 's jewish memorial .
camp survivors and officials from across europe are to gather at the camp sunday to mark its liberation by american troops on april 29 , 1945 as world war ii drew to a close .
between 1933 and 1945 , more than 200,000 people from 38 countries and across the religious spectrum were held by the nazis under appalling conditions .
at least 30,000 people were killed , starved or died of disease there . dw-world.de camp survivors recall horror and freedom hundreds of nazi concentration camp survivors from around the world marked the 60th anniversary of their liberation over the weekend as they mourned the millions who lost their lives .

if he does , britain wo n't be rushing to join the eurozone . blair said wednesday that britain will not be adopting europe 's single currency in the foreseeable future .
" at the moment it does n't look very likely , " he told sky television , " because the economics are n't in the right place . "
" it does n't look very likely at the moment that the economics are going to change dramatically , " he added .
" but the sensible thing to do is to keep your options open . "

" in the next parliament , and at all times , i can guarantee the five tests will have to be met and the results clear and unambiguous , " he stressed .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2005 blair shelves plans for quick euro entry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair sees obstacles ahead for a euro bid if he 's reelected a week ahead of the british general election on may 5 , polls suggest prime minister tony blair is all set to win a third term in power .
if he does , britain wo n't be rushing to join the eurozone . blair said wednesday that britain will not be adopting europe 's single currency in the foreseeable future .
" at the moment it does n't look very likely , " he told sky television , " because the economics are n't in the right place . "
" it does n't look very likely at the moment that the economics are going to change dramatically , " he added .
" but the sensible thing to do is to keep your options open . "
the uk finance minister , gordon brown , has also suggested that a currency switch is not top of labour 's agenda , emphasizing that his government had been right to reject euro entry in the last parliament .
" in the next parliament , and at all times , i can guarantee the five tests will have to be met and the results clear and unambiguous , " he stressed .
if it does n't help , do n't do it according to blair 's labour party election manifesto , euro entry will only happen when these " five tests " - strict conditions focused on economic convergence with euro-zone nations - have been met .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it wo n't help your country economically , you do n't do it , " blair said .
" now , at the moment there is no part of business and industry clamoring to say we need this for our economy , so it does n't look very likely . "
blair and brown have put labour 's economic record at the heart of their campaign , citing low inflation , interest rates and unemployment .
no uk referendum on constitution ?
the prime minister also suggested that a planned referendum in 2006 on the eu constitution may no longer go ahead if france votes against it on may 29 .

if he does , britain wo n't be rushing to join the eurozone . blair said wednesday that britain will not be adopting europe 's single currency in the foreseeable future .
" at the moment it does n't look very likely , " he told sky television , " because the economics are n't in the right place . "
" it does n't look very likely at the moment that the economics are going to change dramatically , " he added .
" but the sensible thing to do is to keep your options open . "
the uk finance minister , gordon brown , has also suggested that a currency switch is not top of labour 's agenda , emphasizing that his government had been right to reject euro entry in the last parliament .
" in the next parliament , and at all times , i can guarantee the five tests will have to be met and the results clear and unambiguous , " he stressed .
if it does n't help , do n't do it according to blair 's labour party election manifesto , euro entry will only happen when these " five tests " - strict conditions focused on economic convergence with euro-zone nations - have been met .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it wo n't help your country economically , you do n't do it , " blair said .
" now , at the moment there is no part of business and industry clamoring to say we need this for our economy , so it does n't look very likely . "
blair and brown have put labour 's economic record at the heart of their campaign , citing low inflation , interest rates and unemployment .
no uk referendum on constitution ?
the prime minister also suggested that a planned referendum in 2006 on the eu constitution may no longer go ahead if france votes against it on may 29 .
" if what was to happen was france was to say ' no ' and then the rest of europe were to tear up the constitution and say we 're forgetting about it , you would n't have a -lrb- vote -rrb- on nothing , " he said .

" if there is a way of resolving this short of applying sanctions , it should be taken , " wto spokesman keith rockwell told afp .
" two months of data are not sufficient to make a true assessment . " the wto 's plea came as the european union 's executive commission was ready to decide on thursday whether to launch a probe into surging chinese clothing imports , in an escalating trade dispute with the asian economic giant . an investigation - which would mark the first step towards formal limits on some chinese clothing imports - comes amid mounting pressure for action from some eu states , led by france and italy , but also growing warnings about the fallout from a potential trade war .
an eu spokesman told afp that brussels also considered the probe an opportunity to talk the issue over with beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headed to wto ?
beijing , meanwhile , is calling the move " a big mistake .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "

this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .
i just do n't like houses with thin walls .

german officials are not best pleased and are considering legal action .
it is , however , a very gray area . the organizers of the 2006 world cup finals in germany are furious after tickets found their way on to the black market just 48 hours after the first sales period ended . the lucky recipients of the initial batch of tickets had hardly had time to comprehend that they were going to the world cup when it was reported that the first offers for resale appeared on the internet auction portal ebay , an unwelcome development the world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- had feared all along . the ok had gone to great lengths to ensure tickets were purchased through the proper channels but , even though it was resigned to the fact that resales would happen , the members of the committee were caught out by the speed of the development and what to do about it . " this is the sort of thing we were keen to avoid , " ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" we will take all the legal measures we can to combat it . " committee advises fans not to buy auction tickets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst r. schmidt schmidt confirmed that the ok had asked ebay not to sell world cup tickets but the two had failed to come to an agreement .
" i can only advise the fans not to buy tickets via an auction , " said schmidt .
" there are still a lot of tickets on offer . "
in total 2.93 million tickets are on sale to the general public and only the first batch of 812,000 tickets have been sold with four more sales periods still to come . but the ok and football 's governing body fifa have been inundated with e-mails complaining about the shortage of tickets available to football fans and with demand outstripping supply many fans have turned to the black market . however , those supporters hoping to beat the complicated system by purchasing world cup tickets may find out that ultimately they are operating in a false economy .
the lucky bidders may be getting cheaper , easier-to-buy tickets but when it comes to match day , they may be barred from entering the stadium . tickets may lead to refused entry " fans obtaining tickets in this way may find themselves denied admission at the turnstiles .
everyone knows that tickets are personalized and can not be transferred without a genuinely pressing reason , and then only with the organizing committee 's approval , " schmidt told the official fifa world cup web site . " there could be problems if the ticket and personal id fail to match , exactly as there would be with an airline ticket .
we 've said it often enough before , and we 're saying it again : tickets are only transferable for good reasons - and profiteering is n't a good reason . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 euro , amtlicher höchstpreis für ein ticket für das finalspiel der fußball-wm 2006 , liegen auf einer zeitschrift , in der die wm-spielstätten vorgestellt werden , illustration vom 31.01.2005 .

tickets via the fifa portal start at 35 euros , rising to 600 euros for the most expensive ticket at the final .
tickets being sold on ebay are going for between 800 and 1,000 euros for a match in the last sixteen . ebay unsure of what laws have been broken the committee is now considering taking legal action as the official terms and conditions of sale have , it claims , been breached , and copyrights infringed .
" the people making these offers do not have the right to transfer tickets allocated to them to third parties , " schmidt added . but there is some debate whether the resale of tickets on ebay is illegal .
the operators of the online auction portal are demanding more details as to which laws or regulations it may have broken and what the future implications might be .
the case becomes even more complicated given that the company works across various borders .
ebay also sells used or expired tickets which are bought in the manner of stamps .
presently ebay.de rules do not inhibit any " live " ticket sales and , therefore , present sellers fall within the rules of the site .
whether they are within the state laws would be up to a court - should any case get that far . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup ticket lottery hits fever pitch thousands of soccer fans received a little electronic message of joy on friday , as e-mails from fifa told them they had made the cut for world cup match tickets .

if the league-leading bavarians win away saturday against fc kaiserslautern , which has lost four of its last five games , they 'll clinch the league 's top spot with four matches left in the season .
schalke 04 , sitting just below munich in the rankings , is aiming to put an end to the slide that has seen it bury its championship hopes and start getting nervous about its champions league chances next season .

" i told the players that it is up to them whether they play in the champions league or uefa cup next season . "
a win at home against seventh place bayer leverkusen would go a long way in calming the team 's nerves and , schalke hopes , put some space between it and third place vfb stuttgart , which is just one point behind the royal blues .
leverkusen , however , has been playing well of late , most recently with a 3-1 win over werder bremen , last year 's german champions .
that seems to have made schalke nervous .

the team could be hoping that fresh faces bring better results next season after signing transfer deals that see matthias langkamp off to wolfsburg and delron buckley heading to dortmund .
hamburg counting points confidence has n't been lacking in hamburg , another european play contender on bremen 's heels , before its visit to wolfsburg on sunday .
" we have better quality than our last four opponents and can set 12 points as a goal , " said hamburg 's belgian striker emile mpenza .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .

anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .
" we will go through a great period of crisis .
the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe .

the jewish community association in the southern state of bavaria said it was insensitive to choose the date to pay tribute to nazi victims , adding that its members would not participate in the official ceremony .
" there is a total ban on driving for jews on this high holiday , " association president josef schuster told the dpa news agency , adding that riding in a car or leaving one 's town were also prohibited under jewish law .
schuster said the international dachau committee , comprised largely of camp survivors , had been informed of the problem one year ago but refused to change the date .
" that is very regrettable , particularly because jews represent a significant number of the victims , " schuster said .
he said the jewish community would hold its own ceremony may 5 at dachau 's jewish memorial .
camp survivors and officials from across europe are to gather at the camp sunday to mark its liberation by american troops on april 29 , 1945 as world war ii drew to a close .
between 1933 and 1945 , more than 200,000 people from 38 countries and across the religious spectrum were held by the nazis under appalling conditions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2005 expansion euphoria eclipsed by doubts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time to fold up and put away plans for a european constitution ?
twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .
" we will go through a great period of crisis .
the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.04.2005 court rejects german eu referendum plea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder signed it , now it 's parliament 's turn to ratify it the federal constitutional court , germany 's highest court , has rejected a legal plea for a popular vote on the eu constitution thursday .
the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .

the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .

it was n't until 2003 that the church of scientology was granted the tax-free status enjoyed by other churches in germany .
the issue has repeatedly strained germany 's relations with the united states , where scientology has strong support and no shortage of high-profile members willing to lobby on its behalf - including a-list hollywood actors like tom cruise -lrb- photo -rrb- or musician beck hansen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous scientologist , actor tom cruise in 1997 , a full-page us newspaper advertisement signed by cruise , dustin hoffmann and oliver stone compared germany 's treatment of the church of scientology to the holocaust .
breach of human rights given that in saarland there are just twenty active members of the church - out of a reported 30,000 across germany - the judge based his ruling on proportionality , a principle of german law that states that any action carried out by the state should not go beyond what it necessary to achieve its objectives .
but last november , a cologne court reached the opposite conclusion , granting intelligence services the right to continue supervision of scientologists on the grounds that there was sufficient evidence to suggest the organization was pursuing anti-democratic goals .
drawing on a series of non-published sources , the court concluded that the church of scientology upheld principles in breach of basic human and civil rights and sought a society devoid of democratic values .
the central task of the federal office for the protection of the constitution is to monitor all anti-democratic activities .
nothing to hide the german church of scientology dismisses accusations against it .
" these are ridiculous statements . " church spokeswoman sabine weber told dw-world from munich .
" our statement of intent is there to be read in all our churches .
we believe in peace and harmony , and human rights are firmly anchored in our values .
the claims were made on the strength of a few lines taken from books by our founder ron hubbard , which were written in the 1950s , " she explained .
" but they were taken completely out of context . " as far as she 's concerned , the intelligence services ' surveillance of the organization is used " as an instrument of discrimination , " a means of stigmatizing the church and keeping it firmly on society 's margins .
" nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light the way it is in germany , " said weber .
" basically , any non-evangelical movement is considered suspect here .
there 's widespread hostility in germany to anything new .
there 's a certain hysteria towards us , and we would like to see people basing their view of us on facts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology 's founder l. ron hubbard but hans liebl , sect commissioner at the munich archdiocese , believes that state surveillance should actually be intensified .
" scientology is a patently anti-constitutional movement , " he told dw-world .
" totalitarian ideologies have always made out that their teachings are misinterpreted , but all you need to do is read ron hubbard 's scriptures . "
one example is the guru 's famously chilling " fair-game policy . " according to hubbard , " a suppressive person or group is one that actively seeks to suppress or damage scientology or a scientologist by suppressive acts … .a suppressive person or group becomes ' fair game . " ' one step further the church maintains that the government 's observation measures are politically motivated and abuse scientologists ’ rights to freedom of religion and belief .
" we simply have no freedom of movement in germany , " said weber . members have documented hundreds of human rights abuses against their members and a host of dirty tricks by intelligence services , including agents attempting to infiltrate churches , spreading false reports about scientologists to their employers to get them fired , and trying to bribe parishioners to lie about their fellow members . scientologists in germany maintain they are routinely dismissed from their jobs , have difficulty finding employment , are screened from political parties and denied the right to contract with the government due to their religious affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the complaints levelled at the scientology movement itself were allegations in the mid-1990s that aggressive real estate companies were linked to cult expansionism - intimidating tenants , forcing them out of their homes and selling condos without paying the previous owner - as well as reports of brainwashing , families torn apart by the organization and both young and elderly people parting with huge sums of money . all lies , says the organization , and weber points to a number of german court decisions in recent years that uphold their rights . " the courts have repeatedly ruled that none of our activities are suspicious , " she said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scientologists fail to escape surveillance a german court here has rejected an appeal from the us-based church of scientology which called for an end to the surveillance of its activities by the domestic security services .

the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .

the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .
the constitution needs to be ratified by all eu member states to become law . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

bierhoff said he was interested in seeing more from deisler and that that midfielder has n't been excluded from the list of possibilities for this summer 's confederations cup .
" i would n't go so far as to say that he wo n't be on the team , " bierhoff said .
" the trainers think a lot of him and naturally regret that he plays very little at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern midfielder sebastian deisler no word from deisler deisler -lrb- photo -rrb- himself has admitted he would like to be included on the confederations cup roster , but decided not to comment on his playing time at bayern .
hamburg sv is rumored to be a potential destination .
the team acknowledged it would be willing to shuffle its lineup to welcome the national team player in a central role .
" it 's a good suggestion , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf told reporters .
" deisler would fit in well with us . "
none of bierhoff 's business his current employer , however , had plenty to say about the intrusion of national team politics on its club decisions .
" i want to be very clear that the bayern team selection is the sole responsibility of manager felix magath , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge told a munich newspaper .
" everyone has their own responsibilities and mr. klinsmann along with mr. bierhoff should accept that and not tell us what to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler , left , has started seven games for munich this season .
regardless of the fact that deisler has started just seven games for bayern this season , some in munich are quite possessive of the benched midfielder who was plagued last season with injury and bouts of depression and burnout .
" he is one of our players and it will stay that way , " bayern spokesperson markus hörwick said .
without making as brash a suggestion as bierhoff , bayern munich president and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer threw his support behind deisler and said the short substitutions are n't helping deisler , who needs longer " to get some continuity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether deisler makes the national team in next summer 's world cup is far from decided .
important role in world cup in addition to support from beckenbauer , deisler may also have good reason to want to stay in the bavarian capital .
magath told die welt newspaper on thursday he wants to see deisler play in the confederations cup and agreed to " work together so that he plays an important role in the world cup next year . "
the deisler affair is not the first time bayern has failed to see eye-to-eye with german national coach klinsmann .
magath was furious that captain michael ballack took part in germany 's asian trip last december , insisting the player should have rested . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi looks to blend experience with youth jürgen klinsmann 's german revolution may look to the recent past to plot success in the future as the national coach named some familiar faces in a provisional squad for germany 's next fixture in slovenia .

" if there is a way of resolving this short of applying sanctions , it should be taken , " wto spokesman keith rockwell told afp .
" two months of data are not sufficient to make a true assessment . " the wto 's plea came as the european union 's executive commission was ready to decide on thursday whether to launch a probe into surging chinese clothing imports , in an escalating trade dispute with the asian economic giant . an investigation - which would mark the first step towards formal limits on some chinese clothing imports - comes amid mounting pressure for action from some eu states , led by france and italy , but also growing warnings about the fallout from a potential trade war .

" if there is a way of resolving this short of applying sanctions , it should be taken , " wto spokesman keith rockwell told afp .
" two months of data are not sufficient to make a true assessment . " the wto 's plea came as the european union 's executive commission was ready to decide on thursday whether to launch a probe into surging chinese clothing imports , in an escalating trade dispute with the asian economic giant . an investigation - which would mark the first step towards formal limits on some chinese clothing imports - comes amid mounting pressure for action from some eu states , led by france and italy , but also growing warnings about the fallout from a potential trade war .

" a official announcement on the decision is expected friday . worried over jobs eu textile producers are worried that thousands of jobs could be lost if urgent action is not taken to hold back a flood of chinese clothing that was unleashed by the end of a 31-year-old global textiles quota system on january 1 . chinese textile imports into the eu have soared by as much as 534 percent for some garments since the end of the quota system , which is far beyond limits the commission considers tolerable . normally , launching an investigation would open a 60-day period during which informal consultations are to be held between brussels and beijing to try to find a solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2005 picking designer homes off the rack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star viennese architect peichl designed this single family home the tarnished image of prefabricated housing may be getting a shine in germany , with a rash of ultra-modern designs on the market .
but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .
i just do n't like houses with thin walls .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2005 picking designer homes off the rack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star viennese architect peichl designed this single family home the tarnished image of prefabricated housing may be getting a shine in germany , with a rash of ultra-modern designs on the market .
but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "

the jewish community association in the southern state of bavaria said it was insensitive to choose the date to pay tribute to nazi victims , adding that its members would not participate in the official ceremony .
" there is a total ban on driving for jews on this high holiday , " association president josef schuster told the dpa news agency , adding that riding in a car or leaving one 's town were also prohibited under jewish law .
schuster said the international dachau committee , comprised largely of camp survivors , had been informed of the problem one year ago but refused to change the date .
" that is very regrettable , particularly because jews represent a significant number of the victims , " schuster said .
he said the jewish community would hold its own ceremony may 5 at dachau 's jewish memorial .
camp survivors and officials from across europe are to gather at the camp sunday to mark its liberation by american troops on april 29 , 1945 as world war ii drew to a close .
between 1933 and 1945 , more than 200,000 people from 38 countries and across the religious spectrum were held by the nazis under appalling conditions .
at least 30,000 people were killed , starved or died of disease there . dw-world.de camp survivors recall horror and freedom hundreds of nazi concentration camp survivors from around the world marked the 60th anniversary of their liberation over the weekend as they mourned the millions who lost their lives .

if he does , britain wo n't be rushing to join the eurozone . blair said wednesday that britain will not be adopting europe 's single currency in the foreseeable future .
" at the moment it does n't look very likely , " he told sky television , " because the economics are n't in the right place . "
" it does n't look very likely at the moment that the economics are going to change dramatically , " he added .
" but the sensible thing to do is to keep your options open . "
the uk finance minister , gordon brown , has also suggested that a currency switch is not top of labour 's agenda , emphasizing that his government had been right to reject euro entry in the last parliament .

if the league-leading bavarians win away saturday against fc kaiserslautern , which has lost four of its last five games , they 'll clinch the league 's top spot with four matches left in the season .
schalke 04 , sitting just below munich in the rankings , is aiming to put an end to the slide that has seen it bury its championship hopes and start getting nervous about its champions league chances next season .

a win at home against seventh place bayer leverkusen would go a long way in calming the team 's nerves and , schalke hopes , put some space between it and third place vfb stuttgart , which is just one point behind the royal blues .
leverkusen , however , has been playing well of late , most recently with a 3-1 win over werder bremen , last year 's german champions .
that seems to have made schalke nervous .
yesterday rangnick took his team to a secret location for some last-minute practice .

the team could be hoping that fresh faces bring better results next season after signing transfer deals that see matthias langkamp off to wolfsburg and delron buckley heading to dortmund .
hamburg counting points confidence has n't been lacking in hamburg , another european play contender on bremen 's heels , before its visit to wolfsburg on sunday .
" we have better quality than our last four opponents and can set 12 points as a goal , " said hamburg 's belgian striker emile mpenza .

bochum , known for its yo-yoing between germany 's top two divisions , was drummed last week by bayern munich and will attempt to take advantage of mainz 's horrendous away record - the team has only earned one win in 15 trips away from home .
borussia dortmund will travel south to freiburg , which after posting just three wins all season , already knows it will be relegated to the second division .

second 's not so bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the shots have n't gone schalke 's way recently " we are second and a lot of teams would like to be in our position , " schalke coach ralf rangnick said last week .
" i told the players that it is up to them whether they play in the champions league or uefa cup next season . "
a win at home against seventh place bayer leverkusen would go a long way in calming the team 's nerves and , schalke hopes , put some space between it and third place vfb stuttgart , which is just one point behind the royal blues .
leverkusen , however , has been playing well of late , most recently with a 3-1 win over werder bremen , last year 's german champions .
that seems to have made schalke nervous .
yesterday rangnick took his team to a secret location for some last-minute practice .

riding a wave of three straight victories , berlin travels to rostock , where everything points to another win for the capital team whose last lost to rostock came in 1997 .
self-criticism seems to be in style with fifth place werder bremen , which will try to fend off 11th place arminia bielefeld this weekend .
bremen 's sports director , klaus allofs , declared that his team " is no longer a top team . "

the team could be hoping that fresh faces bring better results next season after signing transfer deals that see matthias langkamp off to wolfsburg and delron buckley heading to dortmund .
hamburg counting points confidence has n't been lacking in hamburg , another european play contender on bremen 's heels , before its visit to wolfsburg on sunday .
" we have better quality than our last four opponents and can set 12 points as a goal , " said hamburg 's belgian striker emile mpenza .
" if we get them the uefa cup is certain . "
sunday 's second game has hanover scheduled to host 1 .

bochum , known for its yo-yoing between germany 's top two divisions , was drummed last week by bayern munich and will attempt to take advantage of mainz 's horrendous away record - the team has only earned one win in 15 trips away from home .
borussia dortmund will travel south to freiburg , which after posting just three wins all season , already knows it will be relegated to the second division .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .

how can young people maintain their own personalities amidst all the commercial noise ?
the exhibition " coolhunters " shows that youngsters are not just victims of consumerism . young germans live in a highly commercial and media driven world , that at least the idea conveyed in a new exhibition at what the karlsruhe city gallery . television and the internet are crammed with advertising slogans , and upon being asked what they want to be when they are older , a staggering number of kids reply " rich and famous " .
perhaps that 's not surprising given that they 're surrounded by television and music teen success stories . there 's no question that today 's society is a consumer 's paradise .
young people are top targets for banks and the like who rate naivety as a key to highly profitable interest .
21st century youngsters are in fact growing up immersed in unprecedented levels of debt . bildunterschrift : alex mcquilkin " aye , me -lrb- heart explosion -rrb- 1 " , 2004 swept up in the general whirlwind of light-hearted spending , they sink the money they do n't have into cell phone bills , the latest in high-street fashion and mainstream lifestyle accessories they think they need to shore up their existance in the modern world .
in short , they buy their identity , and the price is high .
defining yourself but sabine himmelsbach , who is curator of the exhibition , says not much has changed for this generation of youngsters .
" they are faced with the same questions , such as " how do i define myself ?
how do i carve an identity for myself in society ? "
yet she says the market has become a more dominant force " what we are doing is showing the whole spectrum and proving that youngsters deal with the situation in a critical way . "
the exhibition clearly emphasises the fact that young people are not just victims of the consumer world , but that they contribute to its creation .
one example of such is called ad-busting , in which well-known slogans or brand names are slightly altered turning " snickers " into " suckers " and " t-mobile " into " t-error " . bildunterschrift : andreas gursky " union rave " , 1995 the exhibition in karlsruhe looks at youth culture from many different angles , and comprises videos and objects relating to six subjects : body , language , space , time , gender and violence . what language do young people today speak ?
and how do they construct an identity or a profile , as it is more commonly known today .
what role do clothes , computer games and the internet play ?
how influential is television violence ?
the questions are endless .
the answers too . the show tries to let young people and their objects speak for themselves rather than citing studies and statistics .
there are countless pairs of jeans , t-shirts , underwear and caps , a collection of skateboards and sneakers , and even the essential accessories of the modern-day goth . youth culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pips : lab " luma2solator " , 2004 in keeping with the times , the exhibition 's internet site shows a collection of work , including photos , paintings , interviews and short films by school children and students on the subject of youth culture . young people are the trendsetters in society , they are the ones who best know how to navigate the maze of new media , and for many bright young things , hacking game codes and firewalls is not just fun , but also a route towards creating an identity . coolhunters .

how can young people maintain their own personalities amidst all the commercial noise ?
the exhibition " coolhunters " shows that youngsters are not just victims of consumerism . young germans live in a highly commercial and media driven world , that at least the idea conveyed in a new exhibition at what the karlsruhe city gallery . television and the internet are crammed with advertising slogans , and upon being asked what they want to be when they are older , a staggering number of kids reply " rich and famous " .
perhaps that 's not surprising given that they 're surrounded by television and music teen success stories . there 's no question that today 's society is a consumer 's paradise .
young people are top targets for banks and the like who rate naivety as a key to highly profitable interest .
21st century youngsters are in fact growing up immersed in unprecedented levels of debt . bildunterschrift : alex mcquilkin " aye , me -lrb- heart explosion -rrb- 1 " , 2004 swept up in the general whirlwind of light-hearted spending , they sink the money they do n't have into cell phone bills , the latest in high-street fashion and mainstream lifestyle accessories they think they need to shore up their existance in the modern world .
in short , they buy their identity , and the price is high .
defining yourself but sabine himmelsbach , who is curator of the exhibition , says not much has changed for this generation of youngsters .
" they are faced with the same questions , such as " how do i define myself ?
how do i carve an identity for myself in society ? "
yet she says the market has become a more dominant force " what we are doing is showing the whole spectrum and proving that youngsters deal with the situation in a critical way . "
the exhibition clearly emphasises the fact that young people are not just victims of the consumer world , but that they contribute to its creation .
one example of such is called ad-busting , in which well-known slogans or brand names are slightly altered turning " snickers " into " suckers " and " t-mobile " into " t-error " . bildunterschrift : andreas gursky " union rave " , 1995 the exhibition in karlsruhe looks at youth culture from many different angles , and comprises videos and objects relating to six subjects : body , language , space , time , gender and violence . what language do young people today speak ?
and how do they construct an identity or a profile , as it is more commonly known today .
what role do clothes , computer games and the internet play ?
how influential is television violence ?
the questions are endless .
the answers too . the show tries to let young people and their objects speak for themselves rather than citing studies and statistics .
there are countless pairs of jeans , t-shirts , underwear and caps , a collection of skateboards and sneakers , and even the essential accessories of the modern-day goth . youth culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pips : lab " luma2solator " , 2004 in keeping with the times , the exhibition 's internet site shows a collection of work , including photos , paintings , interviews and short films by school children and students on the subject of youth culture . young people are the trendsetters in society , they are the ones who best know how to navigate the maze of new media , and for many bright young things , hacking game codes and firewalls is not just fun , but also a route towards creating an identity . coolhunters .

how can young people maintain their own personalities amidst all the commercial noise ?
the exhibition " coolhunters " shows that youngsters are not just victims of consumerism . young germans live in a highly commercial and media driven world , that at least the idea conveyed in a new exhibition at what the karlsruhe city gallery . television and the internet are crammed with advertising slogans , and upon being asked what they want to be when they are older , a staggering number of kids reply " rich and famous " .
perhaps that 's not surprising given that they 're surrounded by television and music teen success stories . there 's no question that today 's society is a consumer 's paradise .
young people are top targets for banks and the like who rate naivety as a key to highly profitable interest .
21st century youngsters are in fact growing up immersed in unprecedented levels of debt . bildunterschrift : alex mcquilkin " aye , me -lrb- heart explosion -rrb- 1 " , 2004 swept up in the general whirlwind of light-hearted spending , they sink the money they do n't have into cell phone bills , the latest in high-street fashion and mainstream lifestyle accessories they think they need to shore up their existance in the modern world .
in short , they buy their identity , and the price is high .
defining yourself but sabine himmelsbach , who is curator of the exhibition , says not much has changed for this generation of youngsters .
" they are faced with the same questions , such as " how do i define myself ?
how do i carve an identity for myself in society ? "
yet she says the market has become a more dominant force " what we are doing is showing the whole spectrum and proving that youngsters deal with the situation in a critical way . "
the exhibition clearly emphasises the fact that young people are not just victims of the consumer world , but that they contribute to its creation .
one example of such is called ad-busting , in which well-known slogans or brand names are slightly altered turning " snickers " into " suckers " and " t-mobile " into " t-error " . bildunterschrift : andreas gursky " union rave " , 1995 the exhibition in karlsruhe looks at youth culture from many different angles , and comprises videos and objects relating to six subjects : body , language , space , time , gender and violence . what language do young people today speak ?
and how do they construct an identity or a profile , as it is more commonly known today .
what role do clothes , computer games and the internet play ?
how influential is television violence ?
the questions are endless .
the answers too . the show tries to let young people and their objects speak for themselves rather than citing studies and statistics .
there are countless pairs of jeans , t-shirts , underwear and caps , a collection of skateboards and sneakers , and even the essential accessories of the modern-day goth . youth culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pips : lab " luma2solator " , 2004 in keeping with the times , the exhibition 's internet site shows a collection of work , including photos , paintings , interviews and short films by school children and students on the subject of youth culture . young people are the trendsetters in society , they are the ones who best know how to navigate the maze of new media , and for many bright young things , hacking game codes and firewalls is not just fun , but also a route towards creating an identity . coolhunters .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .

anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .

the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .

how can young people maintain their own personalities amidst all the commercial noise ?
the exhibition " coolhunters " shows that youngsters are not just victims of consumerism . young germans live in a highly commercial and media driven world , that at least the idea conveyed in a new exhibition at what the karlsruhe city gallery . television and the internet are crammed with advertising slogans , and upon being asked what they want to be when they are older , a staggering number of kids reply " rich and famous " .
perhaps that 's not surprising given that they 're surrounded by television and music teen success stories . there 's no question that today 's society is a consumer 's paradise .
young people are top targets for banks and the like who rate naivety as a key to highly profitable interest .
21st century youngsters are in fact growing up immersed in unprecedented levels of debt . bildunterschrift : alex mcquilkin " aye , me -lrb- heart explosion -rrb- 1 " , 2004 swept up in the general whirlwind of light-hearted spending , they sink the money they do n't have into cell phone bills , the latest in high-street fashion and mainstream lifestyle accessories they think they need to shore up their existance in the modern world .
in short , they buy their identity , and the price is high .
defining yourself but sabine himmelsbach , who is curator of the exhibition , says not much has changed for this generation of youngsters .
" they are faced with the same questions , such as " how do i define myself ?
how do i carve an identity for myself in society ? "
yet she says the market has become a more dominant force " what we are doing is showing the whole spectrum and proving that youngsters deal with the situation in a critical way . "
the exhibition clearly emphasises the fact that young people are not just victims of the consumer world , but that they contribute to its creation .
one example of such is called ad-busting , in which well-known slogans or brand names are slightly altered turning " snickers " into " suckers " and " t-mobile " into " t-error " . bildunterschrift : andreas gursky " union rave " , 1995 the exhibition in karlsruhe looks at youth culture from many different angles , and comprises videos and objects relating to six subjects : body , language , space , time , gender and violence . what language do young people today speak ?
and how do they construct an identity or a profile , as it is more commonly known today .
what role do clothes , computer games and the internet play ?
how influential is television violence ?
the questions are endless .
the answers too . the show tries to let young people and their objects speak for themselves rather than citing studies and statistics .
there are countless pairs of jeans , t-shirts , underwear and caps , a collection of skateboards and sneakers , and even the essential accessories of the modern-day goth . youth culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pips : lab " luma2solator " , 2004 in keeping with the times , the exhibition 's internet site shows a collection of work , including photos , paintings , interviews and short films by school children and students on the subject of youth culture . young people are the trendsetters in society , they are the ones who best know how to navigate the maze of new media , and for many bright young things , hacking game codes and firewalls is not just fun , but also a route towards creating an identity . coolhunters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2005 picking designer homes off the rack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star viennese architect peichl designed this single family home the tarnished image of prefabricated housing may be getting a shine in germany , with a rash of ultra-modern designs on the market .
but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .

this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.04.2005 picking designer homes off the rack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star viennese architect peichl designed this single family home the tarnished image of prefabricated housing may be getting a shine in germany , with a rash of ultra-modern designs on the market .
but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .

if the league-leading bavarians win away saturday against fc kaiserslautern , which has lost four of its last five games , they 'll clinch the league 's top spot with four matches left in the season .

a win at home against seventh place bayer leverkusen would go a long way in calming the team 's nerves and , schalke hopes , put some space between it and third place vfb stuttgart , which is just one point behind the royal blues .
leverkusen , however , has been playing well of late , most recently with a 3-1 win over werder bremen , last year 's german champions .

hamburg counting points confidence has n't been lacking in hamburg , another european play contender on bremen 's heels , before its visit to wolfsburg on sunday .

" if there is a way of resolving this short of applying sanctions , it should be taken , " wto spokesman keith rockwell told afp .
" two months of data are not sufficient to make a true assessment . " the wto 's plea came as the european union 's executive commission was ready to decide on thursday whether to launch a probe into surging chinese clothing imports , in an escalating trade dispute with the asian economic giant . an investigation - which would mark the first step towards formal limits on some chinese clothing imports - comes amid mounting pressure for action from some eu states , led by france and italy , but also growing warnings about the fallout from a potential trade war .

" he is one of our players and it will stay that way , " bayern spokesperson markus hörwick said .

bierhoff said he was interested in seeing more from deisler and that that midfielder has n't been excluded from the list of possibilities for this summer 's confederations cup .
" i would n't go so far as to say that he wo n't be on the team , " bierhoff said .
" the trainers think a lot of him and naturally regret that he plays very little at bayern . "

the team acknowledged it would be willing to shuffle its lineup to welcome the national team player in a central role .
" it 's a good suggestion , " hamburg spokesman jörn wolf told reporters .
" deisler would fit in well with us . "
none of bierhoff 's business his current employer , however , had plenty to say about the intrusion of national team politics on its club decisions .
" i want to be very clear that the bayern team selection is the sole responsibility of manager felix magath , " bayern vice-president karl-heinz rummenigge told a munich newspaper .
" everyone has their own responsibilities and mr. klinsmann along with mr. bierhoff should accept that and not tell us what to do . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler , left , has started seven games for munich this season .
regardless of the fact that deisler has started just seven games for bayern this season , some in munich are quite possessive of the benched midfielder who was plagued last season with injury and bouts of depression and burnout .
" he is one of our players and it will stay that way , " bayern spokesperson markus hörwick said .
without making as brash a suggestion as bierhoff , bayern munich president and german soccer legend franz beckenbauer threw his support behind deisler and said the short substitutions are n't helping deisler , who needs longer " to get some continuity . "

the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .

the decision could clear the way for ratification of the charter in may . germany 's federal constitutional court , the highest court in the land , rejected a legal challenge to the country 's ratification of the european union constitution on thursday .
the decision will lead to a parliamentary vote on the charter in may . the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , is due to vote on the charter on may 12 .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is scheduled to vote on it on may 27 .
it is hoped that a german ratification of the constitution will add weight to the french ' yes ' campaign in france 's own referendum which follows two days after the bundestag vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a chance , however , that germany may still be undecided by that time .
a number of the 16 federal states that sit in the upper house have indicated they may hold out on approving the charter , possibly until june , in order to increase their influence over future eu legislation .
in a bid to sway some of the powerful states toward a ' yes ' vote , chancellor gerhard schröder met with four state premiers on thursday . german ratification of the charter requires approval by two-thirds of each chamber but with both main parties supporting the constitution in principle , this is expected to be easily attained . csu minister behind legal bid to halt ratification this did not stop peter gauweiler of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- asking parliament to stop the ratification of the constitution , the plea that led to the constitutional court ruling on thursday . gauweiler had said he wanted a german referendum on the issue , which would have at least delayed berlin 's ratification of the charter .
the government had ruled one out , saying germany 's own constitution does not allow for national referendums . gauweiler is not alone in his support of a popular vote on the constitution .
last year , a survey showed that three-quarters of german voters said that they wanted the chance to vote on the eu constitution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber edmund stoiber , the leader of the csu and ultimately gauweiler 's boss , is also a strong supporter of the referendum idea , saying that such an important decision on the future of europe must rest in the hands of the people , not the politicians , and that there should be a europe-wide referendum on the constitution . stoiber even suggested last summer that the government view bavaria , where he is state premier , as the role model for introducing a federal law that would allow for holding popular votes . stoiber called for changes to germany 's constitution stoiber said article 23 of the basic law -lrb- germany 's constitution -rrb- , which stipulates germany 's position with regard to the eu , needs to be expanded to allow the federal government to call for a referendum whenever the legal basis of the european union is changed , in this case through the introduction of its first-ever constitution . changing the law would require new legislation which in turn has to be backed by two-thirds of the bundestag and the bundesrat , which represents state interests . however , not all conservatives hold the same view .
angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , remains firmly against changing german law to hold a plebiscite on the eu constitution .
merkel will be relieved that the issue has been resolved for now , avoiding a potentially damaging split ahead of general elections next year . court ruling allays spd fears of coalition split bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and joschka fischer the constitutional court 's decision will also ease social democrat fears that the constitution issue could slip out of their control and splinter its coalition with the greens . the greens and the neo-liberal free democrats created an unlikely alliance on the subject last year when they both came out in favor of the introduction of new legislation allowing for national referendums . a schism in the junior coalition party has also been avoided by the court 's decision as it looked increasingly likely that the greens ' de facto leader , foreign minister joschka fischer , would be isolated with a large majority of his colleagues and supporters in favor of a europe-wide referendum . germany may now avoid the french situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks likely there will be no popular vote in germany as there will be in france despite the pressure from several quarters , chancellor schröder has resisted calls to hold a popular vote .
schröder feared that a referendum could lead to a ' no ' vote in germany , much like the current situation in france , and as a result , the whole constitution would be thrown into doubt . it may be that schröder had nothing to fear .
an opinion poll published recently showed broad support for the eu constitution in germany .
some 47 percent of germans back the document , compared with 20 percent who reject it , the survey for the magazine internationale politik found . the eu charter has so far been ratified by six of the eu 's 25 member states but its future is in doubt since opinion polls indicate france will reject it in a national referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.04.2005 -pipe- 17:00 utc german jews slam camp ceremony date german jews on thursday blasted a decision to hold the 60th anniversary ceremony marking the liberation of the dachau concentration camp on the jewish holiday passover .
the jewish community association in the southern state of bavaria said it was insensitive to choose the date to pay tribute to nazi victims , adding that its members would not participate in the official ceremony .
" there is a total ban on driving for jews on this high holiday , " association president josef schuster told the dpa news agency , adding that riding in a car or leaving one 's town were also prohibited under jewish law .
schuster said the international dachau committee , comprised largely of camp survivors , had been informed of the problem one year ago but refused to change the date .
" that is very regrettable , particularly because jews represent a significant number of the victims , " schuster said .
he said the jewish community would hold its own ceremony may 5 at dachau 's jewish memorial .
camp survivors and officials from across europe are to gather at the camp sunday to mark its liberation by american troops on april 29 , 1945 as world war ii drew to a close .

if he does , britain wo n't be rushing to join the eurozone . blair said wednesday that britain will not be adopting europe 's single currency in the foreseeable future .
" at the moment it does n't look very likely , " he told sky television , " because the economics are n't in the right place . "
" it does n't look very likely at the moment that the economics are going to change dramatically , " he added .
" but the sensible thing to do is to keep your options open . "
the uk finance minister , gordon brown , has also suggested that a currency switch is not top of labour 's agenda , emphasizing that his government had been right to reject euro entry in the last parliament .
" in the next parliament , and at all times , i can guarantee the five tests will have to be met and the results clear and unambiguous , " he stressed .
if it does n't help , do n't do it according to blair 's labour party election manifesto , euro entry will only happen when these " five tests " - strict conditions focused on economic convergence with euro-zone nations - have been met .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it wo n't help your country economically , you do n't do it , " blair said .
" now , at the moment there is no part of business and industry clamoring to say we need this for our economy , so it does n't look very likely . "
blair and brown have put labour 's economic record at the heart of their campaign , citing low inflation , interest rates and unemployment .
no uk referendum on constitution ?
the prime minister also suggested that a planned referendum in 2006 on the eu constitution may no longer go ahead if france votes against it on may 29 .
" if what was to happen was france was to say ' no ' and then the rest of europe were to tear up the constitution and say we 're forgetting about it , you would n't have a -lrb- vote -rrb- on nothing , " he said .
" but if there is a constitution , there is a vote . "
but even though britain takes over the revolving eu presidency for the second half of 2005 , europe has not featured heavily in the current election campaign .
iraq back in focus tony blair 's ruling labour party has retained a steady lead over their nearest rival , focusing first and foremost on domestic issues , including the future of the national health service , education , fighting crime , fiscal matters and immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only this week has the issue of the iraq war returned to the fore , with both the conservatives and liberal democrats reiterating their views that tony blair misled parliament and the country on the reasons for committing british troops to the military effort . conservative leader michael howard has gone so far as to suggest that if the prime minister was prepared to lie about the reasons for war , he may lie about the reasons to re-elect him . the prime minister insists the character attacks are a poor attempt to distract voters . voter apathy but with talk of voter apathy and the possibility of one of the lowest election turn outs in decades , there is one area that has seen a dramatic increase - postal voting . three million people have registered to cast their ballot through the mail , three times that of previous elections - sparking concerns of vote-rigging which could be making headlines well after the election result has been declared . but according to the latest statistics from the uk 's broadcasters audience research board , audiences are switching off the tv news shows in their thousands since blair announced the poll on april 5 . " for all their efforts to ' connect ' with viewers , broadcasters are experiencing the same problem as politicians - tv audiences are simply finding the campaign a bore , " said conor dignam , editor of broadcast magazine . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .
" we will go through a great period of crisis .
the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe .

that 's got his club managers in munich upset . bundesliga leaders bayern munich have reacted angrily to comments from german national team manager oliver bierhoff advising sebastian deisler to leave munich as a way of kick-starting his ailing career and getting more playing time before the 2006 world cup .
bierhoff said he was interested in seeing more from deisler and that that midfielder has n't been excluded from the list of possibilities for this summer 's confederations cup .
" i would n't go so far as to say that he wo n't be on the team , " bierhoff said .

" he is one of our players and it will stay that way , " bayern spokesperson markus hörwick said .

magath told die welt newspaper on thursday he wants to see deisler play in the confederations cup and agreed to " work together so that he plays an important role in the world cup next year . "

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .

twelve months ago , europe 's leaders celebrated the eu 's " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 states .
today , they are staring into a black hole , as the french referendum threatens to rip apart their grand plans overnight . " i am not sure there will be a big candle , " said one eu diplomat , referring to the may 1 anniversary of entry into the bloc of 10 countries - including eight ex-communist states from central europe - which marked the continent 's historic reunification half a century after it was ripped apart by war .
the eu newcomers - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - of course have much to celebrate after joining the rich club they had worked towards for so long .
but even those wanting to fete the first birthday of the enlarged bloc admit that it is clouded by the looming may 29 french referendum on the eu 's new constitutional treaty . the repercussions of a french " non " the constitution , signed among much fanfare in rome last october after some four years of wrangling , is designed to prevent decision-making gridlock in the expanded union .
to come into force , it must be ratified by all 25 eu states .
diplomats have long conceded that it could be rejected in a small number of countries , but have suggested ways of getting round the problem could in most cases be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but a " non " in france , a founding member of the european project in 1957 and long a driving force of the eu along with germany , is another matter entirely .
" there is a strong chance that france will vote " no " , which would probably kill off the treaty for good , " said daniel keohane of the center for european reform . apathy and skepticism the current threat of a french ' no , ' while unexpected , did not come completely out of the blue .
anyone watching closely over the last 12 months would have seen the warning signs .
the fireworks which erupted across europe last may 1 fizzled out barely a month later , when european parliament elections confirmed two trends which have long threatened the eu : euro-apathy and euro skepticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then came the fiasco surrounding the nomination of a new eu commission , centered on the unedifying spectacle of eu leaders horse-trading to avoid an openly anti-gay commissioner , rocco buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , being put in charge of civil rights across europe . anti-turkish feeling but undoubtedly more controversial was the eu 's decision in december to give turkey a green light to start talks on joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prospect of the vast muslim majority country one day becoming the eu 's biggest state only fuelled anti-eu feeling among those concerned that the eu was going too far beyond its original aim .
indeed , french president jacques chirac was so worried that anti-turkish feeling could color his planned eu constitution referendum , that he insisted on delaying a start date for ankara 's eu entry talks until october . the bolkenstein directive but then , just as the eu 's plans seemed to be on the rails , french anti-eu campaigners succeeded in drawing public attention to a hitherto little-noticed draft eu law , for some arcane issue of services sector deregulation .
the so-called bolkestein directive has become the focus for broader concerns , notably france 's diminishing influence in the eu , which many french fear is veering too far towards an anglo-saxon free market model . no more europe ?
whatever the reasons for a " no " vote , most people agree that a french rejection of the constitution would lead at the very least to a period of inertia , and at the worst to a gradual break-up of the entire project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there will be no more europe , " said former eu commission chief romano prodi recently .
" we will go through a great period of crisis .
the problem will not only be a catastrophe for france , but the fall of europe . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis deepens over french eu stance even as french voters look set to torpedo the eu constitution in a referendum , luxembourg premier juncker added a new twist to the dilemma this week , saying the us hopes the french will reject the treaty .

how can young people maintain their own personalities amidst all the commercial noise ?
the exhibition " coolhunters " shows that youngsters are not just victims of consumerism . young germans live in a highly commercial and media driven world , that at least the idea conveyed in a new exhibition at what the karlsruhe city gallery . television and the internet are crammed with advertising slogans , and upon being asked what they want to be when they are older , a staggering number of kids reply " rich and famous " .
perhaps that 's not surprising given that they 're surrounded by television and music teen success stories . there 's no question that today 's society is a consumer 's paradise .
young people are top targets for banks and the like who rate naivety as a key to highly profitable interest .
21st century youngsters are in fact growing up immersed in unprecedented levels of debt . bildunterschrift : alex mcquilkin " aye , me -lrb- heart explosion -rrb- 1 " , 2004 swept up in the general whirlwind of light-hearted spending , they sink the money they do n't have into cell phone bills , the latest in high-street fashion and mainstream lifestyle accessories they think they need to shore up their existance in the modern world .
in short , they buy their identity , and the price is high .
defining yourself but sabine himmelsbach , who is curator of the exhibition , says not much has changed for this generation of youngsters .
" they are faced with the same questions , such as " how do i define myself ?
how do i carve an identity for myself in society ? "
yet she says the market has become a more dominant force " what we are doing is showing the whole spectrum and proving that youngsters deal with the situation in a critical way . "
the exhibition clearly emphasises the fact that young people are not just victims of the consumer world , but that they contribute to its creation .
one example of such is called ad-busting , in which well-known slogans or brand names are slightly altered turning " snickers " into " suckers " and " t-mobile " into " t-error " . bildunterschrift : andreas gursky " union rave " , 1995 the exhibition in karlsruhe looks at youth culture from many different angles , and comprises videos and objects relating to six subjects : body , language , space , time , gender and violence . what language do young people today speak ?
and how do they construct an identity or a profile , as it is more commonly known today .
what role do clothes , computer games and the internet play ?
how influential is television violence ?
the questions are endless .
the answers too . the show tries to let young people and their objects speak for themselves rather than citing studies and statistics .
there are countless pairs of jeans , t-shirts , underwear and caps , a collection of skateboards and sneakers , and even the essential accessories of the modern-day goth . youth culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pips : lab " luma2solator " , 2004 in keeping with the times , the exhibition 's internet site shows a collection of work , including photos , paintings , interviews and short films by school children and students on the subject of youth culture . young people are the trendsetters in society , they are the ones who best know how to navigate the maze of new media , and for many bright young things , hacking game codes and firewalls is not just fun , but also a route towards creating an identity . coolhunters .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .
i just do n't like houses with thin walls .

but if the eu goes ahead with emergency procedures , the process would more quickly to a much more serious formal consultation period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading the charge french foreign minister jean-pierre raffarin told french television channel france 2 : " there is a real problem and i think that the chinese should acknowledge it and that we find a solution in dialogue straight away and , if necessary , by safeguard measures in the coming weeks . " proving material injury the two sides are bound by wto rules which limit the actions member states can take to temporarily protect domestic producers , as well as the agreement on china 's accession to the wto in 2001 . when china joined the organization , it accepted that a trading partner could place a temporary cap on its textile and clothing imports from the moment talks were requested . under wto rules , the eu must first prove claims of " material injury " to its own producers , and that that injury is caused by chinese imports , before it can levy temporary trade barriers on some products . with the us also conducting a review of chinese textile imports , the wto is likely to end up arbitrating between trade titans if china formally objects to any safeguard measures , experts said . " this is bigger than just textiles , " said john weekes , a trade consultant and former canadian ambassador to the wto .
" it does provide a test of the wto .
this is a challenge that ca n't be avoided but one that , if managed well , can show the importance of the organization . " warning of fallout meanwhile , in bangkok during an asian trip , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson urged european manufacturers calling for limits on chinese textiles to consider the possible fallout on other companies . " i have to be mindful of all those european interests , " he said in a press conference .
" it does n't work one way , you have to see both sides of the coin , and i hope that those who are debating this issue and representing industrial interests will bear in mind that there is more than one set of european interests in this question . " mandelson told reporters during his first official visit to thailand that while some europe-based manufacturers wanted safeguards , european firms with factories in china exporting to the eu would not welcome them . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , china at loggerheads over textiles the eu 's textile producers are expected to call on the european commission to launch emergency measures to limit booming chinese imports .

german officials are not best pleased and are considering legal action .
it is , however , a very gray area . the organizers of the 2006 world cup finals in germany are furious after tickets found their way on to the black market just 48 hours after the first sales period ended . the lucky recipients of the initial batch of tickets had hardly had time to comprehend that they were going to the world cup when it was reported that the first offers for resale appeared on the internet auction portal ebay , an unwelcome development the world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- had feared all along . the ok had gone to great lengths to ensure tickets were purchased through the proper channels but , even though it was resigned to the fact that resales would happen , the members of the committee were caught out by the speed of the development and what to do about it . " this is the sort of thing we were keen to avoid , " ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" we will take all the legal measures we can to combat it . " committee advises fans not to buy auction tickets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst r. schmidt schmidt confirmed that the ok had asked ebay not to sell world cup tickets but the two had failed to come to an agreement .
" i can only advise the fans not to buy tickets via an auction , " said schmidt .
" there are still a lot of tickets on offer . "
in total 2.93 million tickets are on sale to the general public and only the first batch of 812,000 tickets have been sold with four more sales periods still to come . but the ok and football 's governing body fifa have been inundated with e-mails complaining about the shortage of tickets available to football fans and with demand outstripping supply many fans have turned to the black market . however , those supporters hoping to beat the complicated system by purchasing world cup tickets may find out that ultimately they are operating in a false economy .
the lucky bidders may be getting cheaper , easier-to-buy tickets but when it comes to match day , they may be barred from entering the stadium . tickets may lead to refused entry " fans obtaining tickets in this way may find themselves denied admission at the turnstiles .
everyone knows that tickets are personalized and can not be transferred without a genuinely pressing reason , and then only with the organizing committee 's approval , " schmidt told the official fifa world cup web site . " there could be problems if the ticket and personal id fail to match , exactly as there would be with an airline ticket .
we 've said it often enough before , and we 're saying it again : tickets are only transferable for good reasons - and profiteering is n't a good reason . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 euro , amtlicher höchstpreis für ein ticket für das finalspiel der fußball-wm 2006 , liegen auf einer zeitschrift , in der die wm-spielstätten vorgestellt werden , illustration vom 31.01.2005 .

foto : peter endig / lsn + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + the ok is also concerned that supporters are paying over the odds for tickets through other channels than the official one .
tickets via the fifa portal start at 35 euros , rising to 600 euros for the most expensive ticket at the final .
tickets being sold on ebay are going for between 800 and 1,000 euros for a match in the last sixteen . ebay unsure of what laws have been broken the committee is now considering taking legal action as the official terms and conditions of sale have , it claims , been breached , and copyrights infringed .
" the people making these offers do not have the right to transfer tickets allocated to them to third parties , " schmidt added . but there is some debate whether the resale of tickets on ebay is illegal .
the operators of the online auction portal are demanding more details as to which laws or regulations it may have broken and what the future implications might be .
the case becomes even more complicated given that the company works across various borders .
ebay also sells used or expired tickets which are bought in the manner of stamps .
presently ebay.de rules do not inhibit any " live " ticket sales and , therefore , present sellers fall within the rules of the site .
whether they are within the state laws would be up to a court - should any case get that far . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup ticket lottery hits fever pitch thousands of soccer fans received a little electronic message of joy on friday , as e-mails from fifa told them they had made the cut for world cup match tickets .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .

german officials are not best pleased and are considering legal action .
it is , however , a very gray area . the organizers of the 2006 world cup finals in germany are furious after tickets found their way on to the black market just 48 hours after the first sales period ended . the lucky recipients of the initial batch of tickets had hardly had time to comprehend that they were going to the world cup when it was reported that the first offers for resale appeared on the internet auction portal ebay , an unwelcome development the world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- had feared all along . the ok had gone to great lengths to ensure tickets were purchased through the proper channels but , even though it was resigned to the fact that resales would happen , the members of the committee were caught out by the speed of the development and what to do about it . " this is the sort of thing we were keen to avoid , " ok vice-president horst r. schmidt told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" we will take all the legal measures we can to combat it . " committee advises fans not to buy auction tickets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst r. schmidt schmidt confirmed that the ok had asked ebay not to sell world cup tickets but the two had failed to come to an agreement .
" i can only advise the fans not to buy tickets via an auction , " said schmidt .
" there are still a lot of tickets on offer . "
in total 2.93 million tickets are on sale to the general public and only the first batch of 812,000 tickets have been sold with four more sales periods still to come . but the ok and football 's governing body fifa have been inundated with e-mails complaining about the shortage of tickets available to football fans and with demand outstripping supply many fans have turned to the black market . however , those supporters hoping to beat the complicated system by purchasing world cup tickets may find out that ultimately they are operating in a false economy .
the lucky bidders may be getting cheaper , easier-to-buy tickets but when it comes to match day , they may be barred from entering the stadium . tickets may lead to refused entry " fans obtaining tickets in this way may find themselves denied admission at the turnstiles .
everyone knows that tickets are personalized and can not be transferred without a genuinely pressing reason , and then only with the organizing committee 's approval , " schmidt told the official fifa world cup web site . " there could be problems if the ticket and personal id fail to match , exactly as there would be with an airline ticket .
we 've said it often enough before , and we 're saying it again : tickets are only transferable for good reasons - and profiteering is n't a good reason . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 600 euro , amtlicher höchstpreis für ein ticket für das finalspiel der fußball-wm 2006 , liegen auf einer zeitschrift , in der die wm-spielstätten vorgestellt werden , illustration vom 31.01.2005 .
am dienstag -lrb- 01.02.2005 -rrb- fällt der startschuss zum verkauf der eintrittskarten für die fifa fussball-weltmeisterschaft 2006 .

märz 2005 karten für alle 64 wm-spiele geordert werden .
foto : peter endig / lsn + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - bildfunk + + + the ok is also concerned that supporters are paying over the odds for tickets through other channels than the official one .
tickets via the fifa portal start at 35 euros , rising to 600 euros for the most expensive ticket at the final .
tickets being sold on ebay are going for between 800 and 1,000 euros for a match in the last sixteen . ebay unsure of what laws have been broken the committee is now considering taking legal action as the official terms and conditions of sale have , it claims , been breached , and copyrights infringed .
" the people making these offers do not have the right to transfer tickets allocated to them to third parties , " schmidt added . but there is some debate whether the resale of tickets on ebay is illegal .
the operators of the online auction portal are demanding more details as to which laws or regulations it may have broken and what the future implications might be .
the case becomes even more complicated given that the company works across various borders .
ebay also sells used or expired tickets which are bought in the manner of stamps .
presently ebay.de rules do not inhibit any " live " ticket sales and , therefore , present sellers fall within the rules of the site .
whether they are within the state laws would be up to a court - should any case get that far . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup ticket lottery hits fever pitch thousands of soccer fans received a little electronic message of joy on friday , as e-mails from fifa told them they had made the cut for world cup match tickets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.04.2005 scientology wins court battle in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientologists in germany say they are unfairly vilified saarland 's higher administrative court ruled wednesday that state intelligence services are no longer permitted to monitor the activities of the controversial scientology organization . four years after saarland 's higher administrative court decided to allow the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- to keep tabs on the activities of local scientologists , the court has now ruled in favor of the church of scientology 's appeal on the grounds that seven years of intelligence surveillance failed to yield results justifying continued monitoring . ongoing harassment the decision was welcomed by the scientology movement , which maintains it suffers ongoing government harassment and religious persecution despite no evidence of wrongdoing . in germany , scientology tends to be seen as a commercial enterprise with primarily economical interests .
it was n't until 2003 that the church of scientology was granted the tax-free status enjoyed by other churches in germany .
the issue has repeatedly strained germany 's relations with the united states , where scientology has strong support and no shortage of high-profile members willing to lobby on its behalf - including a-list hollywood actors like tom cruise -lrb- photo -rrb- or musician beck hansen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous scientologist , actor tom cruise in 1997 , a full-page us newspaper advertisement signed by cruise , dustin hoffmann and oliver stone compared germany 's treatment of the church of scientology to the holocaust .
breach of human rights given that in saarland there are just twenty active members of the church - out of a reported 30,000 across germany - the judge based his ruling on proportionality , a principle of german law that states that any action carried out by the state should not go beyond what it necessary to achieve its objectives .
but last november , a cologne court reached the opposite conclusion , granting intelligence services the right to continue supervision of scientologists on the grounds that there was sufficient evidence to suggest the organization was pursuing anti-democratic goals .
drawing on a series of non-published sources , the court concluded that the church of scientology upheld principles in breach of basic human and civil rights and sought a society devoid of democratic values .
the central task of the federal office for the protection of the constitution is to monitor all anti-democratic activities .
nothing to hide the german church of scientology dismisses accusations against it .
" these are ridiculous statements . " church spokeswoman sabine weber told dw-world from munich .
" our statement of intent is there to be read in all our churches .
we believe in peace and harmony , and human rights are firmly anchored in our values .
the claims were made on the strength of a few lines taken from books by our founder ron hubbard , which were written in the 1950s , " she explained .
" but they were taken completely out of context . " as far as she 's concerned , the intelligence services ' surveillance of the organization is used " as an instrument of discrimination , " a means of stigmatizing the church and keeping it firmly on society 's margins .
" nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light the way it is in germany , " said weber .
" basically , any non-evangelical movement is considered suspect here .
there 's widespread hostility in germany to anything new .
there 's a certain hysteria towards us , and we would like to see people basing their view of us on facts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology 's founder l. ron hubbard but hans liebl , sect commissioner at the munich archdiocese , believes that state surveillance should actually be intensified .
" scientology is a patently anti-constitutional movement , " he told dw-world .
" totalitarian ideologies have always made out that their teachings are misinterpreted , but all you need to do is read ron hubbard 's scriptures . "
one example is the guru 's famously chilling " fair-game policy . " according to hubbard , " a suppressive person or group is one that actively seeks to suppress or damage scientology or a scientologist by suppressive acts … .a suppressive person or group becomes ' fair game . " ' one step further the church maintains that the government 's observation measures are politically motivated and abuse scientologists ’ rights to freedom of religion and belief .
" we simply have no freedom of movement in germany , " said weber . members have documented hundreds of human rights abuses against their members and a host of dirty tricks by intelligence services , including agents attempting to infiltrate churches , spreading false reports about scientologists to their employers to get them fired , and trying to bribe parishioners to lie about their fellow members . scientologists in germany maintain they are routinely dismissed from their jobs , have difficulty finding employment , are screened from political parties and denied the right to contract with the government due to their religious affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the complaints levelled at the scientology movement itself were allegations in the mid-1990s that aggressive real estate companies were linked to cult expansionism - intimidating tenants , forcing them out of their homes and selling condos without paying the previous owner - as well as reports of brainwashing , families torn apart by the organization and both young and elderly people parting with huge sums of money . all lies , says the organization , and weber points to a number of german court decisions in recent years that uphold their rights . " the courts have repeatedly ruled that none of our activities are suspicious , " she said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scientologists fail to escape surveillance a german court here has rejected an appeal from the us-based church of scientology which called for an end to the surveillance of its activities by the domestic security services .

if the league-leading bavarians win away saturday against fc kaiserslautern , which has lost four of its last five games , they 'll clinch the league 's top spot with four matches left in the season .
schalke 04 , sitting just below munich in the rankings , is aiming to put an end to the slide that has seen it bury its championship hopes and start getting nervous about its champions league chances next season .
second 's not so bad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most the shots have n't gone schalke 's way recently " we are second and a lot of teams would like to be in our position , " schalke coach ralf rangnick said last week .
" i told the players that it is up to them whether they play in the champions league or uefa cup next season . "
a win at home against seventh place bayer leverkusen would go a long way in calming the team 's nerves and , schalke hopes , put some space between it and third place vfb stuttgart , which is just one point behind the royal blues .
leverkusen , however , has been playing well of late , most recently with a 3-1 win over werder bremen , last year 's german champions .
that seems to have made schalke nervous .
yesterday rangnick took his team to a secret location for some last-minute practice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart is hoping for a champions league spot another schalke stumble would satisfy stuttgart , which travels to 15th place mönchengladbach this week . but stuttgart trainer matthias sammer knows a little about stumbles too .
vfb suffered an embarrassing loss to hansa rostock two weeks ago and played to a scoreless tie at home last week against wolfsburg .
berlin 's european chances strengthen after a 4-1 win last week against schalke , european opportunities have opened up for hertha berlin , currently in fourth place .
riding a wave of three straight victories , berlin travels to rostock , where everything points to another win for the capital team whose last lost to rostock came in 1997 .
self-criticism seems to be in style with fifth place werder bremen , which will try to fend off 11th place arminia bielefeld this weekend .
bremen 's sports director , klaus allofs , declared that his team " is no longer a top team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen have n't had a lot to celebrate of late in the bundesliga bielefeld looks like it will finish in the middle of the table this season .
the team could be hoping that fresh faces bring better results next season after signing transfer deals that see matthias langkamp off to wolfsburg and delron buckley heading to dortmund .
hamburg counting points confidence has n't been lacking in hamburg , another european play contender on bremen 's heels , before its visit to wolfsburg on sunday .
" we have better quality than our last four opponents and can set 12 points as a goal , " said hamburg 's belgian striker emile mpenza .
" if we get them the uefa cup is certain . "
sunday 's second game has hanover scheduled to host 1 .
fc nuremberg .
hanover and nuremberg , separated by three points and ranked 12th and 13th respectively , played to a 1-1 draw in the bundesliga 's first round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz 's michael thurk , right , and the rest of his team are fighting for their place in the bundesliga battle in basement continues bundesliga newcomer mainz 05 looks fairly sure of staying in germany 's first division next season before its trip to bochum , where the relegation question is still a murky one .
bochum , known for its yo-yoing between germany 's top two divisions , was drummed last week by bayern munich and will attempt to take advantage of mainz 's horrendous away record - the team has only earned one win in 15 trips away from home .
borussia dortmund will travel south to freiburg , which after posting just three wins all season , already knows it will be relegated to the second division .
" we 've been planning for the second division for weeks , " freiburg trainer volker finke said .
" it was simply a terrible season for us with a lot of losses and the team just never got it together .

with the exception of the final day , bayern munich does not have any real hurdles to overcome on their way to their 19th title .

but will a new look be enough to counteract german prejudice ? typical german houses tend to have something of the fortress about them , with thick masonry walls that are made to stand for generations .
for most germans , prefabricated , timber-frame houses are seen as a second-rate option : cheap to build and quick to fall apart .
a prefabricated house can be compared to buying clothes off the rack instead of having them made to order .
the various elements of a house - nearly always made of wood - are cut to specifications in factories .
these are then assembled , sometimes within days , at a building site .
but the notion that " prefab homes " are cheaply made and are cookie-cutter solutions for low-end buyers is changing .
in the past decade , prefab houses have become more diverse and individualized .
they lead the industry in terms of energy efficiency , ecologically sound building techniques , and technical advances .
image boost and now , thanks in part to some star architects , they are improving their image in terms of design as well .
in the past few years , architects such as gustav peichl , matteo thun and frank gehry have turned their hand to designing " off the rack " houses , with surprising results .
bildunterschrift : frank gehry 's " courtyard house " for weberhaus the single-family peichl-haus , an arched , zinc-roofed building slightly reminiscent of a quonset hut , was designed for the hanlo company by the viennese star architect peichl , best known for grand public buildings like the bundeskunsthalle , germany 's national art museum .
frank gehry , who created the guggenheim bilbao , has designed " court yard house " for the german firm weberhaus -lrb- above -rrb- .
and milan based star matteo thun - who founded italy 's memphis design group and led the creative team at swatch for several years - turned out ' o sole mio ' -lrb- below -rrb- , a pent-roofed marvel of passive-energy use , for austrian firm griffner haus .
bildunterschrift : thun in front of " o sole mio " houses like the sleek , cubist mini-home " option , " from weberhaus -lrb- below , right -rrb- - just 66 square meters -lrb- 710 square feet -rrb- - and baufritz 's modern , l-shaped energy-saving home " terra 2 " -lrb- below -rrb- are two further examples of houses that have taken home design awards in the past few years , even without star architects behind them .
wood v. stone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 66 square meter option , by weberhaus the new design effort is aimed at punching up the image of prefabricated housing in germany , in order to attract a new clientele , said christoph windschief , spokesman for the german prefabricated housing association -lrb- bdf -rrb- .
many germans feel that houses built in wood - as is the case with most prefab houses - are inferior to homes built of stone or cinderblock , known as massivbau .
bildunterschrift : baufritz 's terra2 this belief stems from the 1960s and 1970s , windschief said .
" in the 70s , prefabricated homes were definitely a cheap alternative .
but that is no longer the case .
now the prices for prefabricated houses and architect-designed houses are comparable .
some of the prefabricated houses are even more expensive than massivbau , " windschief said .
a prefabricated half-timbered house containing wood , glass and steel elements can run into the millions , he added .
the higher prices reflect an attitude change on the part of the makers of prefab housing .
" the companies want their own products to be more valuable , more appropriate to people who can afford a house , " windschief said .
' key in the door ' so if it is n't necessarily cheaper , why choose it ?
there are a number of reasons , said dieter langschwager , executive assistant at hanlo , the company that commissioned the peichl house .
first off , the building process is simplified .
" everything is centrally organized .
the builder does n't have to deal with one company for the walls , another for the roof , another for the electricity and another for the paint .
you get it all , finished .
in the end the key is in the door , " he explained .
also , said bdf 's windschief , prefab houses attract particular buyers - people interested in ecologically sound living .
ecologically cutting-edge " because of the timber frame walls with insulation , prefabricated houses are more energy efficient , " windschief explained .
they also tend to be on the cutting edge of technology in terms of using passive and solar energy , as well as " healthy home " building materials .
and , he added , prefabricated house makers are the leaders in developing " smart homes , " in which multimedia devices and electronic controls are part of the construction .
despite their positive attributes , just 13 percent of homes built in germany are prefabricated , according to alexander oswald , who keeps statistics for the bdf .
this number has held pretty much steady over the past ten years , a fact he attributes to the german " conservative way of thinking . "
yet in scandinavia , where houses have always been built in wood , between 70 and 90 percent of new homes are prefabricated , oswald said .
and even in austria , which shares a border and a good deal of cultural history with germany , one-third of all new homes are prefab .
" it seems they do n't share the german prejudice about building with timber , " he added .
strict building codes for his part , bdf 's windschief blamed the prefab housing industry for not doing a good enough job in promoting itself .
" its something we have to work on , " he said .
but while the designer homes may be turning heads , windschief noted traditional designs still prevail when it comes to actual home building .
" germans generally do n't want extravagant house design - they tend to go for tradition , " he said .
hanlo 's langschwager noted that when the peichl house came out , in 2000 , " it got a lot of attention ...
we had more than 1,000 enquiries . "
in the end , though , the house was only built twice - in austria .
the problem ?
it did n't meet building codes in most german neighborhoods .
this points up a problem for many of the prefabricated houses , especially those with " exotic " design .
" often , these houses can not actually be built , " langschwager noted .
" the building codes are strict .
the roof may have to have a certain slope , to fit in with the buildings around it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most german houses have peaked roofs yet many of the designer houses rely on a pent roof - one that is curved or only very slightly angled - to make the best use of passive energy sources .
typical building codes in germany call for gabled roofs , with 60 degree angles .
this may explain why only 20 percent of the prefab houses sold in germany are the designer type , according to windschiefer .
uphill battle despite the eye-catching new designs , it seems prefabricated houses face an uphill public relations battle in germany .
take the case of ingo bauer , a cologne based businessman who recently spent a troubled year having a house built to his specifications .
would he perhaps have been better off with a prefabricated house ?
did he even consider it ?
" i would never consider a prefabricated house , " he said .
" they 're made of cheap materials and slapped together like lego blocks .
you ca n't compare the quality , even if they are cheaper . ...
also , i can spot a prefabricated house a mile away - they have thin walls that look like cardboard .
i just do n't like houses with thin walls .

if he does , britain wo n't be rushing to join the eurozone . blair said wednesday that britain will not be adopting europe 's single currency in the foreseeable future .
" at the moment it does n't look very likely , " he told sky television , " because the economics are n't in the right place . "
" it does n't look very likely at the moment that the economics are going to change dramatically , " he added .
" but the sensible thing to do is to keep your options open . "
the uk finance minister , gordon brown , has also suggested that a currency switch is not top of labour 's agenda , emphasizing that his government had been right to reject euro entry in the last parliament .
" in the next parliament , and at all times , i can guarantee the five tests will have to be met and the results clear and unambiguous , " he stressed .
if it does n't help , do n't do it according to blair 's labour party election manifesto , euro entry will only happen when these " five tests " - strict conditions focused on economic convergence with euro-zone nations - have been met .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if it wo n't help your country economically , you do n't do it , " blair said .
" now , at the moment there is no part of business and industry clamoring to say we need this for our economy , so it does n't look very likely . "
blair and brown have put labour 's economic record at the heart of their campaign , citing low inflation , interest rates and unemployment .
no uk referendum on constitution ?
the prime minister also suggested that a planned referendum in 2006 on the eu constitution may no longer go ahead if france votes against it on may 29 .
" if what was to happen was france was to say ' no ' and then the rest of europe were to tear up the constitution and say we 're forgetting about it , you would n't have a -lrb- vote -rrb- on nothing , " he said .
" but if there is a constitution , there is a vote . "
but even though britain takes over the revolving eu presidency for the second half of 2005 , europe has not featured heavily in the current election campaign .
iraq back in focus tony blair 's ruling labour party has retained a steady lead over their nearest rival , focusing first and foremost on domestic issues , including the future of the national health service , education , fighting crime , fiscal matters and immigration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only this week has the issue of the iraq war returned to the fore , with both the conservatives and liberal democrats reiterating their views that tony blair misled parliament and the country on the reasons for committing british troops to the military effort . conservative leader michael howard has gone so far as to suggest that if the prime minister was prepared to lie about the reasons for war , he may lie about the reasons to re-elect him . the prime minister insists the character attacks are a poor attempt to distract voters . voter apathy but with talk of voter apathy and the possibility of one of the lowest election turn outs in decades , there is one area that has seen a dramatic increase - postal voting . three million people have registered to cast their ballot through the mail , three times that of previous elections - sparking concerns of vote-rigging which could be making headlines well after the election result has been declared . but according to the latest statistics from the uk 's broadcasters audience research board , audiences are switching off the tv news shows in their thousands since blair announced the poll on april 5 . " for all their efforts to ' connect ' with viewers , broadcasters are experiencing the same problem as politicians - tv audiences are simply finding the campaign a bore , " said conor dignam , editor of broadcast magazine . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

how can young people maintain their own personalities amidst all the commercial noise ?
the exhibition " coolhunters " shows that youngsters are not just victims of consumerism . young germans live in a highly commercial and media driven world , that at least the idea conveyed in a new exhibition at what the karlsruhe city gallery . television and the internet are crammed with advertising slogans , and upon being asked what they want to be when they are older , a staggering number of kids reply " rich and famous " .
perhaps that 's not surprising given that they 're surrounded by television and music teen success stories . there 's no question that today 's society is a consumer 's paradise .
young people are top targets for banks and the like who rate naivety as a key to highly profitable interest .
21st century youngsters are in fact growing up immersed in unprecedented levels of debt . bildunterschrift : alex mcquilkin " aye , me -lrb- heart explosion -rrb- 1 " , 2004 swept up in the general whirlwind of light-hearted spending , they sink the money they do n't have into cell phone bills , the latest in high-street fashion and mainstream lifestyle accessories they think they need to shore up their existance in the modern world .
in short , they buy their identity , and the price is high .
defining yourself but sabine himmelsbach , who is curator of the exhibition , says not much has changed for this generation of youngsters .
" they are faced with the same questions , such as " how do i define myself ?
how do i carve an identity for myself in society ? "
yet she says the market has become a more dominant force " what we are doing is showing the whole spectrum and proving that youngsters deal with the situation in a critical way . "
the exhibition clearly emphasises the fact that young people are not just victims of the consumer world , but that they contribute to its creation .
one example of such is called ad-busting , in which well-known slogans or brand names are slightly altered turning " snickers " into " suckers " and " t-mobile " into " t-error " . bildunterschrift : andreas gursky " union rave " , 1995 the exhibition in karlsruhe looks at youth culture from many different angles , and comprises videos and objects relating to six subjects : body , language , space , time , gender and violence . what language do young people today speak ?
and how do they construct an identity or a profile , as it is more commonly known today .
what role do clothes , computer games and the internet play ?
how influential is television violence ?
the questions are endless .
the answers too . the show tries to let young people and their objects speak for themselves rather than citing studies and statistics .
there are countless pairs of jeans , t-shirts , underwear and caps , a collection of skateboards and sneakers , and even the essential accessories of the modern-day goth . youth culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pips : lab " luma2solator " , 2004 in keeping with the times , the exhibition 's internet site shows a collection of work , including photos , paintings , interviews and short films by school children and students on the subject of youth culture . young people are the trendsetters in society , they are the ones who best know how to navigate the maze of new media , and for many bright young things , hacking game codes and firewalls is not just fun , but also a route towards creating an identity . coolhunters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.04.2005 scientology wins court battle in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientologists in germany say they are unfairly vilified saarland 's higher administrative court ruled wednesday that state intelligence services are no longer permitted to monitor the activities of the controversial scientology organization . four years after saarland 's higher administrative court decided to allow the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- to keep tabs on the activities of local scientologists , the court has now ruled in favor of the church of scientology 's appeal on the grounds that seven years of intelligence surveillance failed to yield results justifying continued monitoring . ongoing harassment the decision was welcomed by the scientology movement , which maintains it suffers ongoing government harassment and religious persecution despite no evidence of wrongdoing . in germany , scientology tends to be seen as a commercial enterprise with primarily economical interests .
it was n't until 2003 that the church of scientology was granted the tax-free status enjoyed by other churches in germany .
the issue has repeatedly strained germany 's relations with the united states , where scientology has strong support and no shortage of high-profile members willing to lobby on its behalf - including a-list hollywood actors like tom cruise -lrb- photo -rrb- or musician beck hansen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous scientologist , actor tom cruise in 1997 , a full-page us newspaper advertisement signed by cruise , dustin hoffmann and oliver stone compared germany 's treatment of the church of scientology to the holocaust .
breach of human rights given that in saarland there are just twenty active members of the church - out of a reported 30,000 across germany - the judge based his ruling on proportionality , a principle of german law that states that any action carried out by the state should not go beyond what it necessary to achieve its objectives .
but last november , a cologne court reached the opposite conclusion , granting intelligence services the right to continue supervision of scientologists on the grounds that there was sufficient evidence to suggest the organization was pursuing anti-democratic goals .
drawing on a series of non-published sources , the court concluded that the church of scientology upheld principles in breach of basic human and civil rights and sought a society devoid of democratic values .
the central task of the federal office for the protection of the constitution is to monitor all anti-democratic activities .
nothing to hide the german church of scientology dismisses accusations against it .
" these are ridiculous statements . " church spokeswoman sabine weber told dw-world from munich .
" our statement of intent is there to be read in all our churches .
we believe in peace and harmony , and human rights are firmly anchored in our values .
the claims were made on the strength of a few lines taken from books by our founder ron hubbard , which were written in the 1950s , " she explained .
" but they were taken completely out of context . " as far as she 's concerned , the intelligence services ' surveillance of the organization is used " as an instrument of discrimination , " a means of stigmatizing the church and keeping it firmly on society 's margins .
" nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light the way it is in germany , " said weber .
" basically , any non-evangelical movement is considered suspect here .
there 's widespread hostility in germany to anything new .
there 's a certain hysteria towards us , and we would like to see people basing their view of us on facts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology 's founder l. ron hubbard but hans liebl , sect commissioner at the munich archdiocese , believes that state surveillance should actually be intensified .
" scientology is a patently anti-constitutional movement , " he told dw-world .
" totalitarian ideologies have always made out that their teachings are misinterpreted , but all you need to do is read ron hubbard 's scriptures . "
one example is the guru 's famously chilling " fair-game policy . " according to hubbard , " a suppressive person or group is one that actively seeks to suppress or damage scientology or a scientologist by suppressive acts … .a suppressive person or group becomes ' fair game . " ' one step further the church maintains that the government 's observation measures are politically motivated and abuse scientologists ’ rights to freedom of religion and belief .
" we simply have no freedom of movement in germany , " said weber . members have documented hundreds of human rights abuses against their members and a host of dirty tricks by intelligence services , including agents attempting to infiltrate churches , spreading false reports about scientologists to their employers to get them fired , and trying to bribe parishioners to lie about their fellow members . scientologists in germany maintain they are routinely dismissed from their jobs , have difficulty finding employment , are screened from political parties and denied the right to contract with the government due to their religious affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the complaints levelled at the scientology movement itself were allegations in the mid-1990s that aggressive real estate companies were linked to cult expansionism - intimidating tenants , forcing them out of their homes and selling condos without paying the previous owner - as well as reports of brainwashing , families torn apart by the organization and both young and elderly people parting with huge sums of money . all lies , says the organization , and weber points to a number of german court decisions in recent years that uphold their rights . " the courts have repeatedly ruled that none of our activities are suspicious , " she said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scientologists fail to escape surveillance a german court here has rejected an appeal from the us-based church of scientology which called for an end to the surveillance of its activities by the domestic security services .

it was n't until 2003 that the church of scientology was granted the tax-free status enjoyed by other churches in germany .
the issue has repeatedly strained germany 's relations with the united states , where scientology has strong support and no shortage of high-profile members willing to lobby on its behalf - including a-list hollywood actors like tom cruise -lrb- photo -rrb- or musician beck hansen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : famous scientologist , actor tom cruise in 1997 , a full-page us newspaper advertisement signed by cruise , dustin hoffmann and oliver stone compared germany 's treatment of the church of scientology to the holocaust .
breach of human rights given that in saarland there are just twenty active members of the church - out of a reported 30,000 across germany - the judge based his ruling on proportionality , a principle of german law that states that any action carried out by the state should not go beyond what it necessary to achieve its objectives .
but last november , a cologne court reached the opposite conclusion , granting intelligence services the right to continue supervision of scientologists on the grounds that there was sufficient evidence to suggest the organization was pursuing anti-democratic goals .
drawing on a series of non-published sources , the court concluded that the church of scientology upheld principles in breach of basic human and civil rights and sought a society devoid of democratic values .
the central task of the federal office for the protection of the constitution is to monitor all anti-democratic activities .
nothing to hide the german church of scientology dismisses accusations against it .
" these are ridiculous statements . " church spokeswoman sabine weber told dw-world from munich .
" our statement of intent is there to be read in all our churches .
we believe in peace and harmony , and human rights are firmly anchored in our values .
the claims were made on the strength of a few lines taken from books by our founder ron hubbard , which were written in the 1950s , " she explained .
" but they were taken completely out of context . " as far as she 's concerned , the intelligence services ' surveillance of the organization is used " as an instrument of discrimination , " a means of stigmatizing the church and keeping it firmly on society 's margins .
" nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light the way it is in germany , " said weber .
" basically , any non-evangelical movement is considered suspect here .
there 's widespread hostility in germany to anything new .
there 's a certain hysteria towards us , and we would like to see people basing their view of us on facts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology 's founder l. ron hubbard but hans liebl , sect commissioner at the munich archdiocese , believes that state surveillance should actually be intensified .
" scientology is a patently anti-constitutional movement , " he told dw-world .
" totalitarian ideologies have always made out that their teachings are misinterpreted , but all you need to do is read ron hubbard 's scriptures . "
one example is the guru 's famously chilling " fair-game policy . " according to hubbard , " a suppressive person or group is one that actively seeks to suppress or damage scientology or a scientologist by suppressive acts … .a suppressive person or group becomes ' fair game . " ' one step further the church maintains that the government 's observation measures are politically motivated and abuse scientologists ’ rights to freedom of religion and belief .
" we simply have no freedom of movement in germany , " said weber . members have documented hundreds of human rights abuses against their members and a host of dirty tricks by intelligence services , including agents attempting to infiltrate churches , spreading false reports about scientologists to their employers to get them fired , and trying to bribe parishioners to lie about their fellow members . scientologists in germany maintain they are routinely dismissed from their jobs , have difficulty finding employment , are screened from political parties and denied the right to contract with the government due to their religious affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the complaints levelled at the scientology movement itself were allegations in the mid-1990s that aggressive real estate companies were linked to cult expansionism - intimidating tenants , forcing them out of their homes and selling condos without paying the previous owner - as well as reports of brainwashing , families torn apart by the organization and both young and elderly people parting with huge sums of money . all lies , says the organization , and weber points to a number of german court decisions in recent years that uphold their rights . " the courts have repeatedly ruled that none of our activities are suspicious , " she said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : scientologists fail to escape surveillance a german court here has rejected an appeal from the us-based church of scientology which called for an end to the surveillance of its activities by the domestic security services .

breach of human rights given that in saarland there are just twenty active members of the church - out of a reported 30,000 across germany - the judge based his ruling on proportionality , a principle of german law that states that any action carried out by the state should not go beyond what it necessary to achieve its objectives .
but last november , a cologne court reached the opposite conclusion , granting intelligence services the right to continue supervision of scientologists on the grounds that there was sufficient evidence to suggest the organization was pursuing anti-democratic goals .
drawing on a series of non-published sources , the court concluded that the church of scientology upheld principles in breach of basic human and civil rights and sought a society devoid of democratic values .
the central task of the federal office for the protection of the constitution is to monitor all anti-democratic activities .
nothing to hide the german church of scientology dismisses accusations against it .
" these are ridiculous statements . " church spokeswoman sabine weber told dw-world from munich .
" our statement of intent is there to be read in all our churches .
we believe in peace and harmony , and human rights are firmly anchored in our values .
the claims were made on the strength of a few lines taken from books by our founder ron hubbard , which were written in the 1950s , " she explained .
" but they were taken completely out of context . " as far as she 's concerned , the intelligence services ' surveillance of the organization is used " as an instrument of discrimination , " a means of stigmatizing the church and keeping it firmly on society 's margins .
" nowhere in the world is the church of scientology seen in a political light the way it is in germany , " said weber .
" basically , any non-evangelical movement is considered suspect here .
there 's widespread hostility in germany to anything new .
there 's a certain hysteria towards us , and we would like to see people basing their view of us on facts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology 's founder l. ron hubbard but hans liebl , sect commissioner at the munich archdiocese , believes that state surveillance should actually be intensified .
" scientology is a patently anti-constitutional movement , " he told dw-world .
" totalitarian ideologies have always made out that their teachings are misinterpreted , but all you need to do is read ron hubbard 's scriptures . "
one example is the guru 's famously chilling " fair-game policy . " according to hubbard , " a suppressive person or group is one that actively seeks to suppress or damage scientology or a scientologist by suppressive acts … .a suppressive person or group becomes ' fair game . " ' one step further the church maintains that the government 's observation measures are politically motivated and abuse scientologists ’ rights to freedom of religion and belief .
" we simply have no freedom of movement in germany , " said weber . members have documented hundreds of human rights abuses against their members and a host of dirty tricks by intelligence services , including agents attempting to infiltrate churches , spreading false reports about scientologists to their employers to get them fired , and trying to bribe parishioners to lie about their fellow members . scientologists in germany maintain they are routinely dismissed from their jobs , have difficulty finding employment , are screened from political parties and denied the right to contract with the government due to their religious affiliation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but among the complaints levelled at the scientology movement itself were allegations in the mid-1990s that aggressive real estate companies were linked to cult expansionism - intimidating tenants , forcing them out of their homes and selling condos without paying the previous owner - as well as reports of brainwashing , families torn apart by the organization and both young and elderly people parting with huge sums of money . all lies , says the organization , and weber points to a number of german court decisions in recent years that uphold their rights . " the courts have repeatedly ruled that none of our activities are suspicious , " she said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : scientologists fail to escape surveillance a german court here has rejected an appeal from the us-based church of scientology which called for an end to the surveillance of its activities by the domestic security services .

research from the trust showed that 378 miles -lrb- 605kms -rrb- of coastline could be affected by rising sea levels .
it said building sea defences would be " unaffordable and counter-productive " in some cases .
it said it would be better to adapt to coastal changes in those areas , rather than trying to stop them . "
erosion is a fact of life and should n't necessarily be viewed as a bad thing " tim collins english nature sea levels are predicted to rise by just under three feet -lrb- 90cm -rrb- over the next 75 years , the report said .
the trust said 126 of its sites , covering more than 4,000 hectares , were already at risk of flooding .
another 33 could be affected over the coming decades , according to the shifting shores report .
it named studland in dorset , porlock in somerset and formby sands in lancashire as being affected by erosion of flooding .
tony burton , the trust 's director of policy , said : " over the next few decades extensive coastal change , especially flooding and erosion caused by sea level rise and more frequent storms , appears inevitable .
" the uk can not ignore the issue and all sectors must plan how to adapt to a future of advancing seas . "
' hold the line ' the report said there was currently no mechanism for people to learn if their homes or businesses were at risk of coastal erosion .
it said decision-making on the issue needed to be made simpler , as with 30 agencies involved in coastal management " achieving coherent and accountable solutions is difficult " .
it said greenhouse gas emissions had to be cut to address the problem , but also recommended " moving with the forces of nature " in some areas .
" a universal ' hold the line ' approach through ever-increasing sea defences is unaffordable and in many cases , counter-productive , creating greater problems for communities and the environment elsewhere , " the report said .
tim collins , head of coastal conservation at english nature , said it was important to recognise that erosion was not always harmful .
he said the seven sisters in sussex would be covered in grass were it not for the effects of erosion .
" erosion is a fact of life and should n't necessarily be viewed as a bad thing , " he said .

should he win his case , it would have a profound effect across europe .
so how does the british government 's attitude compare with its counterparts across the world ?
europe the uk , it seems , has plenty of company in denying prisoners the vote .
a total of eight european states - mainly from the former eastern bloc - have a similar blanket ban , according to the prison reform trust .
in addition , five more countries have no provisions to allow prisoners to vote .
prisoner voting banned armenia bulgaria czech republic estonia hungary luxemburg romania russia united kingdom source : prison reform trust however , these countries are not in the majority .
eighteen states , including the irish republic and spain , put no voting restrictions on prisoners .
but the irish government admits that , in reality , voting for prisoners in the republic is not so straightforward .
their website states : " you have a right to be registered in the political constituency where you would normally live if you were not in prison .
" however , you have no right to be given physical access to a ballot box by temporary release , or a postal vote , or any other way . "
in other european countries , including france and germany , courts have the power to impose loss of voting rights as an additional punishment .
the european court of human rights is currently considering the case of uk prisoner john hirst , who claims his human rights have been abused by denying him the vote .
if he wins , the ruling will force all 46 members of the council of europe to give voting rights at least to some serving prisoners .
united states for the broadest spectrum of approaches to voting rights for convicted criminals , look no further than the united states .
overall , 48 states deny the vote to serving prisoners , 33 disqualify parolees from voting , and eight even bar ex-convicts from the ballot box .
only two states - maine and vermont - place no restrictions on prisoners .
conviction rates among ethnic minorities in the us are much higher than rates among white people .
as a result , a much higher proportion of black and hispanic people are excluded from the vote .
this has prompted criticism and even several lawsuits claiming racial discrimination - particularly in florida , where it is estimated almost one-third of black people are denied the vote .
the state was crucial in deciding the 2000 presidential election in favour of george w bush and his republican party .
many in the defeated democrat party blamed the disqualification of ethnic minorities - traditional democrat voters - for their loss .
rest of the world the european convention on human rights , absorbed into british law in 1998 , was not the first piece of legislation to protect the right to vote .
the united nations enshrined similar rights in its international covenant on civil and political rights -lrb- iccpr -rrb- , signed by the uk in 1976 .
it states that every citizen should have the right to vote and those deprived of their liberty should be treated " with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person " .
it adds : " the penitentiary system shall comprise treatment of prisoners the essential aim of which shall be their reformation and social rehabilitation . "
south africa put this into practice in 1999 when all prisoners were given the right to vote .
the south african constitutional court declared : " the vote of each and every citizen is a badge of dignity and personhood .
quite literally it says that everybody counts . "
canada is also among the countries to soften its approach recently .
in 2002 the supreme court stated that denial of the right to vote " countermands the message that everyone is equally worthy and entitled to respect under the law " .
many other countries give offenders determinate voting bans , depending on the length of their sentences .
the australian electoral commission summarises this approach : " prisoners serving sentences of less than three years , serving sentences of periodic detention , on early release , or on parole , are entitled to enrol and vote . "
but supporters of penal reform say there is still much to be done .
china and brazil , boasting two of the world 's largest prison populations , come under frequent criticism for denying prisoners even the most basic human rights .

bma wales has published a report aimed at the " myths " it said the pro-smoking lobby had told to oppose legislation .
the assembly does not have the power to bring in a smoking ban but has set up a committee to look at the evidence .
the pro-smoking group , forest , said calls for a ban were not based on " incontrovertible scientific evidence of harm to others " .
bma wales said its report , behind the smokescreen , would " clear the air " on the evidence presented to the ams sitting on the assembly 's committee .
the report claims evidence shows that passive smoking increases the risk of lung cancer in non smokers by 20-30 % .
it also claims that evidence from ireland , which brought in a ban last year , shows that banning smoking in public places does not increase smoking in homes .
doctors said they hope now that the welsh assembly government , which voted for a ban in 2003 , will be given the powers to pass the legislation .
the report says the effects of passive smoking kill 30 people daily dr tony calland , chairman of the bma 's welsh council said : " earlier this year , bma cymru wales asked the welsh public to sign a country-wide petition calling on the uk government to give the national assembly the power to exercise a ban .
" over 12,000 people signed that petition , which was presented to 10 downing street .
" if the health of the people of wales is a priority for politicians , then a complete ban on smoking in enclosed public places is the only answer . "
mr james johnson , chairman of the bma -lrb- uk -rrb- said : " the medical profession is united in its calls for a uk-wide ban on smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces .
" recent research reports that passive smoking kills 30 people each day .
the true cost of delaying legislation is not financial , it is human . "
lord harris of high cross , president of the smokers ' lobby group forest , said : " the truth is that the dozens of studies conducted around the world over the past 25 years fail spectacularly to yield any reliably stable , uniform or statistically significant link between lifetime exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer in non-smokers .
" we must keep constantly in mind that the ' evidence ' on passive smoking is based on nothing more substantial than estimates , guesswork , subjective recollections and even gossip . "

in the document , which has been seen by the bbc , lord goldsmith tells tony blair a second resolution was the " safest legal course " .
ten days later his advice raised no such concerns about legality .
lord goldsmith issued a statement saying the document backed up the government 's position .
what the public must now have an answer to is this : what , or who , changed the attorney general 's mind ?
michael howard analysis : pressure grows iraq : an election issue ?
tory leader michael howard has queried the prime minister 's honesty , but mr blair insists he has not lied .
and - in a bbc interview - he has received the public backing of chancellor gordon brown .
but the lib dems said the house of commons would not have voted for war if the earlier legal advice had been known about .
the extract obtained by the bbc was sent to mr blair on 7 march 2003 , a fortnight before the war took place .
in it lord goldsmith argues relying on the original resolution 1441 - which required iraq to disarm - as authorisation for the use of force needed " strong factual grounds " that it had been breached .
the views of unmovic - the un monitoring , verification and inspection commission led by hans blix - and the iaea , the nuclear inspection team led by mohammed elbaradei would be " highly significant " , the attorney general reportedly said .
mr blair has steadfastly resisted pressure to release the full advice of the attorney general .
' further resolution ' in the newly-leaked document , retyped from its original form , lord goldsmith says : " i remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force ...
" i accept that a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 is capable in principle of reviving the authorisation in 678 without a further resolution ...
" however , the argument that resolution 1441 alone has revived the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 will only be sustainable if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that iraq has failed to take the final opportunity . "
key dates 7 march : early legal advice sent to mr blair 7 march : hans blix says iraq accelerating co-operation 17 march : final legal advice given to cabinet 17 march : advice revealed in house of lords 20 march : war starts full text of leaked memo the advice from 10 days later the legal advice was issued on the same day un weapons inspector hans blix said more time was needed to disarm iraq , that the country had accelerated its co-operation but that it could not be described as " immediate compliance " the document concludes by saying : " if we fail to achieve the adoption of a second resolution we would need to consider urgently at that stage the strength of our legal case in the light of circumstances at the time . "
in his statement , lord goldsmith said the document " stands up the case that the government has been making all along " .
" what this document does , as in any legal advice , is to go through the complicated arguments that led me to this view .
" far from showing i reached the conclusion that to go to war would be unlawful , it shows how i took account of all the arguments before reaching my conclusion . "
' unequivocal advice ' and he said the war in iraq was legal , adding that this was what he had said to government , to cabinet and in public at the time .
foreign secretary jack straw told bbc news : " what changed between 7 , when that advice was written , and 17 march when the attorney general came to his very clear decision that military action without a second resolution was justified was the circumstances . "
this included evidence that had been given to lord goldsmith and others that iraq was in breach of resolution 1441 .
but it is understood the 7 march document , with its caveats , was never shown to a full cabinet meeting .
instead , lord goldsmith 's later advice , described by foreign secretary jack straw as " unequivocal " , was shown to the cabinet on 17 march and made public in an answer in the house of lords .
if every member of the cabinet had seen a copy of that legal advice others may have resigned along with robin cook sir menzies campbell lord goldsmith 's statement was there a change of mind ?
the war started on 20 march .
mr howard said : " it is now obvious from this legal advice that on 7 march 2003 , the attorney general raised specific reservations about the legality of war in iraq .
" but mr blair has said that the attorney general 's advice to the cabinet on 17 march was ' very clear ' that the war was legal , and that the attorney general had not changed his mind .
it is obvious that he did .
" so what the public must now have an answer to is this : what , or who , changed the attorney general 's mind ? "
the lib dems want a full public inquiry into the war and want voters to punish the tories as well as labour , as both supported the war , and choose their party instead .
lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said : " if the house of commons had known of the contents of this advice it would n't have voted to endorse military action .
" i strongly suspect that if every member of the cabinet had seen a copy of this advice , others would have resigned , along with robin cook . "
former international development secretary clare short , an opponent of the war , said the leak would " confirm everything that i have been saying - it 's very serious " .
bbc political editor andrew marr said the document would greatly fuel suspicions but was not the " smoking gun " that opponents of the war were looking for .

several operators are offering culturally-specific tours it is where thomas jefferson lived with his devoted slave sally hemings ; where jazz first captivated europe at the end of world war i. it is also where generations of black writers and intellectuals came to enjoy the taste of freedom .
until recently , it was impossible for visitors to the french capital to gain more than a fleeting impression of the city 's role in the development of the african-american identity .
but over the last few years a new form of tourism has appeared thanks to growing demand from the educated black middle class in the us .
several operators are now offering culturally-specific guided tours to open up the rich heritage of josephine baker , sidney bechet , james baldwin , richard wright and the countless others who came to france to escape the suffocating restrictions of their homeland .
black history " african-americans are constantly aware that we have a legacy which it will be very hard - perhaps impossible - to shed .
" it 's a question of constantly being made to feel you are second best , " says monique wells , of discover paris , which offers walking itineraries around paris .
" we are constantly trying to validate ourselves .
and that is why cultural tourism to places like paris is becoming so important . "
a typical tour begins at the arc de triomphe , which the abolitionist leader william wells brown climbed in 1849 and afterwards said that " you could look out over a city where you are finally free , even from bounty hunters and fugitive slave laws " .
in 1917 , the casino de paris hosted the first ever jazz concert below - at number 92 on the champs elysees - lies the former us embassy where the future president , thomas jefferson , started what may or may not have been a sexual affair with hemings .
many african-americans believe he was the father of her seven children , though the issue remains hotly debated .
it was also down the champs elysees that the famed harlem hellfighters and other black regiments paraded at the end of world war i - an episode which was a turning-point in the love affair between black americans and france .
more than 250,000 black soldiers came to france after 1917 but they were looked on with disdain by their white commanders and consigned to menial tasks behind the lines .
but the french recognised their potential and attached the black troops to their own army .
the harlem hellfighters - the us army 's 369th regiment from new york city - saw the longest period of action of any american unit and was the first to reach the river rhine .
" the french treated them like human-beings , and black americans never forgot it , " says ricki stevenson , of black paris tours .
artists and intellectuals musicians attached to black units , such as louis mitchell and james europe , introduced paris to jazz , which has been a passion here ever since .
when black people come here they only have to open their mouths to be immediately classed as simply american .
monique wells , discover paris the first ever jazz concert in the city was in 1917 at the casino de paris .
if few landmarks of the time survive , visitors can still wander the streets of lower montmartre and recall the thriving black club scene of the 1920s when characters like ada " bricktop " smith , adelaide hall , and , of course , josephine baker surfed the craze known as negrophilie .
writers followed .
members of the so-called harlem renaissance like langston hughes hung out in 1920s montparnasse , and after world war ii a new generation of african-americans took advantage of the gi bill to live out a bohemian , and unsegregated , paris existence .
richard wright , chester himes , and james baldwin are only the best-known .
" it was a rite of passage for black american intellectuals , " says ricki stevenson .
" paris was a place to come and think , take a broader view of the world , where - for once - your ideas and talents counted for more than your colour . "

so much has changed in the last decades , but oddly enough , according to monique wells , something of that sense of affirmation is still felt by black americans when they come to paris as tourists .
" african-americans are above all ...
americans .
even if we have been made to suffer for it , our culture is an american culture , " she says .
" when black people come here they only have to open their mouths to be immediately classed - not as black , or coloured - but simply american .
" and for many that is a strange and exhilarating experience . "

shouting , embarrassed giggles and laughter fill the dining hall .
about 150 young men and women are sitting around tables covered with felt tip pens and big sheets of white paper .
their task is to invent and then read out catchy slogans about their feelings for russia .
russia 's future is in our hands !
we will resurrect our country , forward with russia , america ca n't outshine us ! they yell as a wiry man in a track suit springs between the tables urging them on .
one teenage girl in a white baseball hat is carefully colouring in a huge green dollar sign .
" people today are far too interested in money " , she says .
" i think that is wrong .
there are more important values in life like self-respect and love for your country . "
we 've been granted unique access to a training session of a new pro-putin youth group called nashi - our people - at a soviet-era cross-country skiing resort in ryazan , three hours south of moscow .
leadership qualities each table sports a russian flag and a nashi one .
the flag of the new movement looks a bit danish to me but i am told the red stands for russia 's glorious past - at the centre of the ussr - and the white is the country 's shining future . "
putin is the only person who believes democracy and sovereignty can be combined in this country " vasily yakemenko president putin 's advisers are acutely aware that youth organisations played a major role in the momentous events in ukraine last december , and in georgia a year earlier .
there are increasing signs that a nervous kremlin is doing whatever it can to prevent an orange revolution in russia .
music was a crucial factor in boosting morale throughout the fortnight of street protests in kiev .
perhaps that is why some of russia 's most influential rock stars were recently invited to a secret meeting in a hotel by putin 's deputy chief of staff , vladislav surkov .
officially the meeting was held to discuss the state of the music industry but according to nashi 's press spokesman , ivan mostovich , the musicians were also told that the president wanted to " count on them , if something happens , to at least remain neutral " .
nashi 's leader , vasily yakemenko , is a former employee of the presidential administration and one of very few people i meet in russia today who still seems genuinely enthusiastic about putin .
the president , he tells me , is surrounded by incompetent bureaucrats who come from a generation of defeatists .
" what we are doing here today is looking for young people with leadership qualities " , he says .
" after two days of training we 'll pick out the most ambitious ones , the ones who have n't lost their hope in russia . "
different agenda ?
nashi has grand plans to train a new generation of 100,000 young russians , some of whom yakemenko claims will be ready by 2009 to start running the country .
they 'll be taught subjects such as geopolitics , history and economics in 25 different institutes across russia .
" the tragedy of our country at the moment " , he continues , " is that putin is the only person who believes democracy and sovereignty can be combined in this country . "
when i ask what he means by sovereignty yakemenko criticises the role us- and western-funded organisations played in the revolutions on russia 's borders .
to him young people who join groups like ukraine 's pora - time for change - are helping to put the motherland under foreign control .
if yakemenko presents nashi as a spontaneous union of well educated patriots , others worry that the group has a very different agenda .
one activist from the youth wing of the liberal yabloko party claims the movement is trying to intimidate young people and stop them from joining pro-western groups .
ilya yashin , who was thrown out of nashi 's founding conference once his identity was discovered , accused the movement of acting as " a cover for storm brigades " that will use violence against democratic organisations .
law and order " some of our members may be giving up their time to help maintain law and order on the streets - what is wrong with that ? "
nashi spokesman , ivan mostovich according to a report on the relatively independent ren tv channel , in nizhniy novgorod , one of russia 's largest cities , nashi are already setting up squads to maintain order in the streets and local police officials are considering whether to provide the group with tear gas weapons .
but nashi 's spokesman ivan mostovich , dismisses fears that the group is aggressive or nationalistic .
" ever since soviet times we 've had volunteers who helped the police - we called them druzhniki .
and yes , some of our members may be giving up their time to help maintain law and order on the streets .
what is wrong with that ? " he asks .
" i think you have the same kinds of volunteers in the west and that is part of building a responsible civil society . "
spotting ' fascists ' this week it emerged that the movement is planning to distribute a booklet to head teachers across the country to help them to spot " fascists and their sympathisers " in schools .
nashi denounces free market liberals who are ready to sell off russia 's assets to the highest bidder but they also oppose an ultra-left party , the national bolsheviks , led by the maverick writer eduard limonov .
after a decade of apathy , growing numbers of young russians are getting involved in politics .
alexander korsunov , a moscow student , runs a website called skaji nyet or say no .
among other things , the site provides detailed coverage of the social protests which have erupted in several russian cities following the welfare reforms introduced at the beginning of this year .
he says his site is a response to heavy media censorship and he is trying to fill the information gap but he is also hopeful that change is on its way .
" i 'm not trying to provoke people or make them join this or that party .
russians are smart enough to make their own choice but i think there is going to be some new oppositional power - now it is just in the air you know , everybody feels that something is going to happen . "
part two of putin 's game will be broadcast on thursday , 28 april , 2005 at 2000 bst on bbc radio 4 .

" what we are doing here today is looking for young people with leadership qualities " , he says .
" after two days of training we 'll pick out the most ambitious ones , the ones who have n't lost their hope in russia . "
different agenda ?
nashi has grand plans to train a new generation of 100,000 young russians , some of whom yakemenko claims will be ready by 2009 to start running the country .
nashi values : patriotism counts for more than hard currency they 'll be taught subjects such as geopolitics , history and economics in 25 different institutes across russia .
" the tragedy of our country at the moment " , he continues , " is that putin is the only person who believes democracy and sovereignty can be combined in this country . "
when i ask what he means by sovereignty yakemenko criticises the role us- and western-funded organisations played in the revolutions on russia 's borders .
to him young people who join groups like ukraine 's pora - time for change - are helping to put the motherland under foreign control .
if yakemenko presents nashi as a spontaneous union of well educated patriots , others worry that the group has a very different agenda .
one activist from the youth wing of the liberal yabloko party claims the movement is trying to intimidate young people and stop them from joining pro-western groups .
ilya yashin , who was thrown out of nashi 's founding conference once his identity was discovered , accused the movement of acting as " a cover for storm brigades " that will use violence against democratic organisations .
law and order some of our members may be giving up their time to help maintain law and order on the streets - what is wrong with that ?
nashi spokesman , ivan mostovich according to a report on the relatively independent ren tv channel , in nizhniy novgorod , one of russia 's largest cities , nashi are already setting up squads to maintain order in the streets and local police officials are considering whether to provide the group with tear gas weapons .
but nashi 's spokesman ivan mostovich , dismisses fears that the group is aggressive or nationalistic .
" ever since soviet times we 've had volunteers who helped the police - we called them druzhniki .
and yes , some of our members may be giving up their time to help maintain law and order on the streets .
what is wrong with that ? " he asks .
" i think you have the same kinds of volunteers in the west and that is part of building a responsible civil society . "
spotting ' fascists ' this week it emerged that the movement is planning to distribute a booklet to head teachers across the country to help them to spot " fascists and their sympathisers " in schools .
nashi denounces free market liberals who are ready to sell off russia 's assets to the highest bidder but they also oppose an ultra-left party , the national bolsheviks , led by the maverick writer eduard limonov .
after a decade of apathy , growing numbers of young russians are getting involved in politics .
alexander korsunov , a moscow student , runs a website called skaji nyet or say no .
among other things , the site provides detailed coverage of the social protests which have erupted in several russian cities following the welfare reforms introduced at the beginning of this year .
he says his site is a response to heavy media censorship and he is trying to fill the information gap but he is also hopeful that change is on its way .
" i 'm not trying to provoke people or make them join this or that party .
russians are smart enough to make their own choice but i think there is going to be some new oppositional power - now it is just in the air you know , everybody feels that something is going to happen . "
part two of putin 's game will be broadcast on thursday , 28 april , 2005 at 2000 bst on bbc radio 4 .
