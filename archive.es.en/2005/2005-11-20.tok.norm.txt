but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly . rich countries are on their way to meeting the emissions reduction targets set by the kyoto protocol , the head of the un climate change secretariat , richard kinley , said during a bonn press conference on thursday .

" one might say ... that one of the big objectives of the ministers will be - at least for most of them - to celebrate the entry into force of the kyoto protocol , " kinley commented . but the un officials dashed hopes that new targets would be set at montreal for the period after kyoto finishes . " the issue at montreal is basically to … start preparing for what we call the future commitment period of the kyoto protocol , " said the halldor thorgeirsson , a coordinator of the un framework convention on climate change .

thorgeirsson stressed that their participation in developing new , cleaner technologies would be a key issue in montreal . " basically the ability of the atmosphere to capture carbon dioxide is limited , " thorgeirsson said .
" and if you - through carbon trading and through emission limits - give a price signal to industries they then will apply the best available technology . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.11.2005 germany remembers the nuremberg trials 60 years ago großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us chief prosecutor jackson addresses the bench at the trials germans and their wartime allies were due sunday to mark the 60th anniversary of the start of the nuremberg trials that brought leading nazis to justice and forced the nation to confront its past . surviving members of the team of jurists and officials assembled by the allies to try hitler 's henchmen gathered in nuremberg , in southern germany , to reflect on what was arguably the first international military tribunal . among them was whitney harris , one of the american prosecutors , who said that at the start of the process they had no inkling of the extent of the atrocities committed by the nazis . " i did not have the slightest idea of the scale of the genocide that had taken place in germany .
we did not have much solid evidence when we started , " he told the online version of der spiegel weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz , 60 years ago but a picture of some of the worst crimes ever committed emerged as nazi officers revealed under questioning how ss commander heinrich himmler had ordered auschwitz to be turned into a mass extermination camp for jews , gypsies and prisoners of war . of the 1.3 million people sent to auschwitz , 1.1 million died . pleas of innocence all 21 of the defendants who went on trial on november 20 , 1945 pleaded " not guilty " in the oak-paneled courtroom 600 of the nuremberg palace of justice , but the evidence was overwhelming . by october 1 , 1946 , 11 had been sentenced to death and seven had been handed prison terms . among them was hitler 's deputy rudolf hess who was condemned to life imprisonment .
three defendents were acquitted , proving , harris said , that justice was done . high drama erupted when hermann goering , one of the chief architects of the " final solution " to eradicate the jews , committed suicide by taking cyanide in his cell on october 15 , 1946 , on the day of his execution . the 10 others were hanged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the accused in the courtroom what shocked many at the trial was the refusal of the defendants to accept personal responsibility for their role in the crimes carried out by the nazi regime , maintaining that they were merely obeying orders . " i did not expect them to be such pitiful cowards , " arno hamburger , a leader of the jewish community in nuremberg who acted as a translator at the trials , told sunday 's edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . the trial began with a speech in which us chief prosecutor robert h. jackson prophetically remarked that the deeds of the defendants would mark humanity long after they had turned to dust . current debate ironically the anniversary has stirred a heated debate between the united states and the vanquished germans because of washington 's refusal decades later to fully recognise the un 's new international criminal court , tasked with trying war crimes suspects . the anniversary events are to culminate in a speech by philippe kirsch , the president of the icc - a deliberate effort to nudge the united states into action . " we should not lose sight of the role of the united states in the nuremberg trials , " nuremberg mayor ulrich maly told afp . " but we want to emphasize the significance of the nuremberg trials for a global form of justice and draw the link to today . " former prosecutor harris said he strongly condemned washington 's attitude to the icc but he believed that the main message of nuremberg was one against war . " we can not tolerate wars in this world anymore , " he said .
" adolf hitler was only a name that symbolised the absolute and worldwide breakdown of morality in the 20th century .
all these gruesome crimes are not exclusively a german phenomenon .

but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly . rich countries are on their way to meeting the emissions reduction targets set by the kyoto protocol , the head of the un climate change secretariat , richard kinley , said during a bonn press conference on thursday .
but they still have a tough road ahead of them .
the flexible mechanisms outlined in the treaty will help developed countries meet their goal of reducing emissions below 1990 levels , kinley said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the soviet union led to a drop in greenhouse gas emissions un scientists pointed out though that most of the emission reductions so far came after the soviet union collapsed and large industries shut down .
they said that if measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are n't stepped-up , the world will see an increase of up to 10 percent above 1990 levels in the next five years . 100 ministers expected in montreal the information was outlined in a new un publication of key greenhouse gas data that will be presented at the upcoming climate change conference in montreal .
the gathering could be the largest of its kind , and it 's the first since the kyoto protocol came into effect . " one might say ... that one of the big objectives of the ministers will be - at least for most of them - to celebrate the entry into force of the kyoto protocol , " kinley commented . but the un officials dashed hopes that new targets would be set at montreal for the period after kyoto finishes . " the issue at montreal is basically to … start preparing for what we call the future commitment period of the kyoto protocol , " said the halldor thorgeirsson , a coordinator of the un framework convention on climate change .
" the first one already being established is between 2008 and 2012 .
there is then the question of what should happen after 2012 and that discussion will start in montreal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains the world 's biggest polluter as the effects of climate change are felt around the world , governments need to stop thinking about how they can prevent climate change and start working on how to mitigate the damage it will cause , the un scientists said .
thus , one of the buzz words at montreal will be adaptation - helping nations cope with and adapt to the effects of global warming .
us , australian participation needed it also remains to be seen whether the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and australia - which both have not ratified the kyoto protocol - will be willing to commit themselves to binding targets in any new agreement .
thorgeirsson stressed that their participation in developing new , cleaner technologies would be a key issue in montreal . " basically the ability of the atmosphere to capture carbon dioxide is limited , " thorgeirsson said .
" and if you - through carbon trading and through emission limits - give a price signal to industries they then will apply the best available technology . "
" so this is first a question of making sure that the technology is available .
that 's why the efforts of the united states are extremely important , since they are leaders in many of the technology developments .

but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly . rich countries are on their way to meeting the emissions reduction targets set by the kyoto protocol , the head of the un climate change secretariat , richard kinley , said during a bonn press conference on thursday .
but they still have a tough road ahead of them .
the flexible mechanisms outlined in the treaty will help developed countries meet their goal of reducing emissions below 1990 levels , kinley said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the soviet union led to a drop in greenhouse gas emissions un scientists pointed out though that most of the emission reductions so far came after the soviet union collapsed and large industries shut down .
they said that if measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are n't stepped-up , the world will see an increase of up to 10 percent above 1990 levels in the next five years . 100 ministers expected in montreal the information was outlined in a new un publication of key greenhouse gas data that will be presented at the upcoming climate change conference in montreal .
the gathering could be the largest of its kind , and it 's the first since the kyoto protocol came into effect . " one might say ... that one of the big objectives of the ministers will be - at least for most of them - to celebrate the entry into force of the kyoto protocol , " kinley commented . but the un officials dashed hopes that new targets would be set at montreal for the period after kyoto finishes . " the issue at montreal is basically to … start preparing for what we call the future commitment period of the kyoto protocol , " said the halldor thorgeirsson , a coordinator of the un framework convention on climate change .
" the first one already being established is between 2008 and 2012 .
there is then the question of what should happen after 2012 and that discussion will start in montreal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains the world 's biggest polluter as the effects of climate change are felt around the world , governments need to stop thinking about how they can prevent climate change and start working on how to mitigate the damage it will cause , the un scientists said .
thus , one of the buzz words at montreal will be adaptation - helping nations cope with and adapt to the effects of global warming .
us , australian participation needed it also remains to be seen whether the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and australia - which both have not ratified the kyoto protocol - will be willing to commit themselves to binding targets in any new agreement .
thorgeirsson stressed that their participation in developing new , cleaner technologies would be a key issue in montreal . " basically the ability of the atmosphere to capture carbon dioxide is limited , " thorgeirsson said .
" and if you - through carbon trading and through emission limits - give a price signal to industries they then will apply the best available technology . "
" so this is first a question of making sure that the technology is available .
that 's why the efforts of the united states are extremely important , since they are leaders in many of the technology developments .

paying men to adopt since 1998 , foreign women giving birth to a baby in germany have been given residence status if a german claimed to be the father . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german father means german citizenship according to estimates , up to 1,600 foreign women are year have been granted entry into germany since immigration officials stopped checking paternity claims . the justice ministry says some of those women arrived in germany days before giving birth , and paid german men to adopt their babies . foreign babies born in germany are automatically given german citizenship and their mothers can not be deported if the father is a german . benefit fraud bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many paternity claims are false less dramatically , the loophole was also exploited by foreign men who paid german single mothers to be able to adopt their children . those germans who received payments were mostly welfare recipients , so the justice ministry is also looking at benefit fraud in connection with fake paternities . getting tough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries plans to get tough proposals by justice minister brigitte zypries to toughen immigration laws are a focus of discussions among justice ministers from all 16 of germany 's federal states . they include an expansion of the powers of immigration authorities to investigate families which may have broken paternity laws . the new regulations are also intended to make it easier for authorities to press for genetic testing to resolve paternity cases .
crime experts say that there is already a grey market offering fake paternities in germany including legal advice about how to acquire a residence status . they say the practice has already sharpened the interest of organized crime , and that action by the justice authorities must be taken swiftly . uwe hessler -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fathers ' rights suffer setback german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support .

but they also warn that without further efforts emissions could rise significantly . rich countries are on their way to meeting the emissions reduction targets set by the kyoto protocol , the head of the un climate change secretariat , richard kinley , said during a bonn press conference on thursday .
but they still have a tough road ahead of them .
the flexible mechanisms outlined in the treaty will help developed countries meet their goal of reducing emissions below 1990 levels , kinley said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the soviet union led to a drop in greenhouse gas emissions un scientists pointed out though that most of the emission reductions so far came after the soviet union collapsed and large industries shut down .
they said that if measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are n't stepped-up , the world will see an increase of up to 10 percent above 1990 levels in the next five years . 100 ministers expected in montreal the information was outlined in a new un publication of key greenhouse gas data that will be presented at the upcoming climate change conference in montreal .
the gathering could be the largest of its kind , and it 's the first since the kyoto protocol came into effect . " one might say ... that one of the big objectives of the ministers will be - at least for most of them - to celebrate the entry into force of the kyoto protocol , " kinley commented . but the un officials dashed hopes that new targets would be set at montreal for the period after kyoto finishes . " the issue at montreal is basically to … start preparing for what we call the future commitment period of the kyoto protocol , " said the halldor thorgeirsson , a coordinator of the un framework convention on climate change .
" the first one already being established is between 2008 and 2012 .
there is then the question of what should happen after 2012 and that discussion will start in montreal . "

us , australian participation needed it also remains to be seen whether the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and australia - which both have not ratified the kyoto protocol - will be willing to commit themselves to binding targets in any new agreement .
thorgeirsson stressed that their participation in developing new , cleaner technologies would be a key issue in montreal . " basically the ability of the atmosphere to capture carbon dioxide is limited , " thorgeirsson said .
" and if you - through carbon trading and through emission limits - give a price signal to industries they then will apply the best available technology . "
" so this is first a question of making sure that the technology is available .

on a visit to beijing , he also said he and his chinese counterpart hu jintao had agreed to work together to reduce their trade imbalance .
earlier , he attended a service at one of the few officially-recognised christian churches in beijing .
the white house said mr bush - a devout christian - wanted to show his support for expressions of faith in china .
boeing deal the two leaders met for talks at the great hall of the people on the edge of beijing 's tiananmen square .
it comes at a time of tension over the effect of cheap chinese imports on us manufacturing .
mr hu said they had expressed their willingness to " join hands together to gradually achieve a balance of trade " between the two countries . "
it is important that social , political and religious freedoms grow in china and we encourage china to continue making the historic transition to greater freedom " george w bush " the frictions and problems that may arise in this rapid development of the two-way trade may be properly addressed through consultations , " he added .
he also promised to " unswervingly " press ahead towards a more market-based currency .
washington says the yuan is undervalued to boost china 's exports at the expense of jobs elsewhere .
and mr hu said china was willing to take action to end the illegal copying of goods which the us businesses say cost them billions of dollars .
mr bush said a relationship with china was important to the us , and he invited mr hu to make the visit he had to postpone in september because of hurricane katrina .
before the talks , a us aide said china was to buy 70 boeing aircraft .
correspondents say the purchase may be an attempt to soothe american frustration over china 's trade surplus , which is tipped to hit $ 200bn this year .
' healthy society ' earlier , a key bush aide said mr bush would speak to the chinese leader about " giving more opportunities for chinese citizens to worship and speak freely " .
on sunday morning , mr bush attended the gangwashi church - one of five officially recognised protestant churches in beijing - accompanied by his wife laura .
he wrote in the church guest book : " may god bless the christians of china . "
" my hope is that the government of china will not fear christians who gather to worship openly , " mr bush told reporters afterwards .
" a healthy society is a society that welcomes all faiths . "
the bbc 's rupert wingfield-hayes in beijing says mr bush 's tone was encouraging rather than lecturing - showing a conscious effort to address the issue without alienating the chinese leadership .
while on the japanese leg of his regional tour , mr bush urged china to allow more political freedom and pointed to taiwan - considered a renegade province by beijing - as a model of a society that has successfully moved from " repression to democracy " .
but a spokesman in beijing said the chinese " enjoy all forms of democracy and freedom under law " .
mr bush is nearing the end of his east asia tour .
he flies to mongolia on monday .

on a visit to beijing , he also said he and his chinese counterpart hu jintao had agreed to work together to reduce their trade imbalance .
earlier , he attended a service at one of the few officially-recognised christian churches in beijing .
the white house said mr bush - a devout christian - wanted to show his support for expressions of faith in china .
boeing deal the two leaders met for talks at the great hall of the people on the edge of beijing 's tiananmen square .
it comes at a time of tension over the effect of cheap chinese imports on us manufacturing .
mr hu said they had expressed their willingness to " join hands together to gradually achieve a balance of trade " between the two countries .
it is important that social , political and religious freedoms grow in china and we encourage china to continue making the historic transition to greater freedom george w bush " the frictions and problems that may arise in this rapid development of the two-way trade may be properly addressed through consultations , " he added .
he also promised to " unswervingly " press ahead towards a more market-based currency .
washington says the yuan is undervalued to boost china 's exports at the expense of jobs elsewhere .
and mr hu said china was willing to take action to end the illegal copying of goods which the us businesses say cost them billions of dollars .
mr bush said a relationship with china was important to the us , and he invited mr hu to make the visit he had to postpone in september because of hurricane katrina .
before the talks , a us aide said china was to buy 70 boeing aircraft .
correspondents say the purchase may be an attempt to soothe american frustration over china 's trade surplus , which is tipped to hit $ 200bn this year .
' healthy society ' earlier , a key bush aide said mr bush would speak to the chinese leader about " giving more opportunities for chinese citizens to worship and speak freely " .
on sunday morning , mr bush attended the gangwashi church - one of five officially recognised protestant churches in beijing - accompanied by his wife laura .
mr bush attended church to show his support for china 's christians he wrote in the church guest book : " may god bless the christians of china . "
" my hope is that the government of china will not fear christians who gather to worship openly , " mr bush told reporters afterwards .
" a healthy society is a society that welcomes all faiths . "
the bbc 's rupert wingfield-hayes in beijing says mr bush 's tone was encouraging rather than lecturing - showing a conscious effort to address the issue without alienating the chinese leadership .
while on the japanese leg of his regional tour , mr bush urged china to allow more political freedom and pointed to taiwan - considered a renegade province by beijing - as a model of a society that has successfully moved from " repression to democracy " .
but a spokesman in beijing said the chinese " enjoy all forms of democracy and freedom under law " .
mr bush is nearing the end of his east asia tour .
he flies to mongolia on monday .

the goal is to tackle on one of the recurring issues that arose during the un world summit on the information society in tunis about the lack of material online in languages other than english .
wikimedia has emerged from the wikipedia , the freely-available , editable , open and collaborative online encyclopaedia set up by jimmy wales .
" the wikimedia foundation is a non-profit organisation with the essential goal to distribute that free encyclopaedia to everyone on the planet in their own language , " said mr wales .
the wikimedia projects are about accessing cultural diversity and giving voices and knowledge to people in their own language .
together they form a giant , multicultural , adaptable and free cerebral net .
going local the foundation is setting up local chapters to further support local participation .
" wikipedia is organised by languages , not by location , but we are building local chapters because local people like to meet and it is a way for us to interface with them on a local scale , " said mr wales .

" what you do n't get in the mainstream media is so much of the background material .
so you can come to wikipedia and get a lot of background , " said mr wales .
a good example of that was after the asian tsunami .
people visited wikipedia to search for information about the phenomenon .
but eyewitness videos and images were also published on blogs and photo sharing websites , and collected and used by mainstream news organisations .
wikicommons is an attempt to aggregate all that content to make it accessible to anyone , even mainstream media , anywhere , for free , under free licence terms .
it collects all the images , sound , and video that are all freely licensed so that they can be used in any kind of cultural context .
it is like an information hub for a " global free culture " , said mr wales .
silencing voices but the issue for an organisation which relies on volunteers and only two full-time employees is making groups outside of the online community aware of it , and to get them using it as part of their projects .
wikipedia now attracts roughly more than 2.4 billion hits a month , running on more than 120 servers globally , managed by volunteers who communicate via internet chat .
it says it has a broader reach than the los angeles times , new york times , msnbc.com and the chicago tribune , collectively .
however , there are still big barriers to making the foundation 's efforts truly global .
" freedom of speech is critical for all cultures , " said mr wales .
but in cultures where there are oppressive regimes , the voice of people , no matter what their political stance , is not being expressed at all .
china has cut off contact with the wikipedia encyclopaedia " one of the things we see in wikipedia is that by silencing your own citizens , you are not only preventing them from reading information from outside , but you are also silencing the information that comes out .
access to wikipedia has recently been blocked by chinese authorities which , mr wales said , has backfired in some senses .
it means people from mainland china can not read or contribute to the chinese wikipedia .
the number of edits on the chinese version since the blocking has dropped by around 40 % , according to mr wales .
" the mainland chinese tend to take a chinese mainland point of view on controversial issues , and the taiwanese take another the taiwanese viewpoint , " he explained .
" hopefully it is just a mistake and it will be unblocked .
it has happened before , " he said .
wikipedia gives people the chance to post articles which they think are of cultural and social importance from their own countries , which people are encouraged to translate into their own languages .
each international-facing wikipedia site features articles on the front page which are culturally relevant .

the wikimedia foundation has set itself the ambitious aim of providing knowledge to people in their own language .
the goal is to tackle on one of the recurring issues that arose during the un world summit on the information society in tunis about the lack of material online in languages other than english .
wikimedia has emerged from the wikipedia , the freely-available , editable , open and collaborative online encyclopaedia set up by jimmy wales .
" the wikimedia foundation is a non-profit organisation with the essential goal to distribute that free encyclopaedia to everyone on the planet in their own language , " said mr wales .
the wikimedia projects are about accessing cultural diversity and giving voices and knowledge to people in their own language .
together they form a giant , multicultural , adaptable and free cerebral net .
going local the foundation is setting up local chapters to further support local participation .
" wikipedia is organised by languages , not by location , but we are building local chapters because local people like to meet and it is a way for us to interface with them on a local scale , " said mr wales .
the foundation 's other projects also include wikicommons , wikibooks , and wikinews .
freedom of speech is critical for all cultures jimmy wales , wikimedia foundation preserving the essence of the net " wikinews was born out of observation that when any major news ever happens , wikipedia becomes a very valuable resource for people . "
" what you do n't get in the mainstream media is so much of the background material .
so you can come to wikipedia and get a lot of background , " said mr wales .
a good example of that was after the asian tsunami .
people visited wikipedia to search for information about the phenomenon .
but eyewitness videos and images were also published on blogs and photo sharing websites , and collected and used by mainstream news organisations .
wikicommons is an attempt to aggregate all that content to make it accessible to anyone , even mainstream media , anywhere , for free , under free licence terms .
it collects all the images , sound , and video that are all freely licensed so that they can be used in any kind of cultural context .
it is like an information hub for a " global free culture " , said mr wales .
silencing voices but the issue for an organisation which relies on volunteers and only two full-time employees is making groups outside of the online community aware of it , and to get them using it as part of their projects .
wikipedia now attracts roughly more than 2.4 billion hits a month , running on more than 120 servers globally , managed by volunteers who communicate via internet chat .
it says it has a broader reach than the los angeles times , new york times , msnbc.com and the chicago tribune , collectively .
however , there are still big barriers to making the foundation 's efforts truly global .
" freedom of speech is critical for all cultures , " said mr wales .
but in cultures where there are oppressive regimes , the voice of people , no matter what their political stance , is not being expressed at all .
china has cut off contact with the wikipedia encyclopaedia " one of the things we see in wikipedia is that by silencing your own citizens , you are not only preventing them from reading information from outside , but you are also silencing the information that comes out .
access to wikipedia has recently been blocked by chinese authorities which , mr wales said , has backfired in some senses .
it means people from mainland china can not read or contribute to the chinese wikipedia .
the number of edits on the chinese version since the blocking has dropped by around 40 % , according to mr wales .
" the mainland chinese tend to take a chinese mainland point of view on controversial issues , and the taiwanese take another the taiwanese viewpoint , " he explained .
" hopefully it is just a mistake and it will be unblocked .
it has happened before , " he said .
wikipedia gives people the chance to post articles which they think are of cultural and social importance from their own countries , which people are encouraged to translate into their own languages .
each international-facing wikipedia site features articles on the front page which are culturally relevant .
" we are not talking about dissidents and being critical of the chinese government , " he said , stressing that wikipedia was about having the tools to promote your culture .

the wikimedia foundation has set itself the ambitious aim of providing knowledge to people in their own language .
the goal is to tackle on one of the recurring issues that arose during the un world summit on the information society in tunis about the lack of material online in languages other than english .
wikimedia has emerged from the wikipedia , the freely-available , editable , open and collaborative online encyclopaedia set up by jimmy wales .
" the wikimedia foundation is a non-profit organisation with the essential goal to distribute that free encyclopaedia to everyone on the planet in their own language , " said mr wales .
the wikimedia projects are about accessing cultural diversity and giving voices and knowledge to people in their own language .
together they form a giant , multicultural , adaptable and free cerebral net .
going local the foundation is setting up local chapters to further support local participation .
" wikipedia is organised by languages , not by location , but we are building local chapters because local people like to meet and it is a way for us to interface with them on a local scale , " said mr wales .
the foundation 's other projects also include wikicommons , wikibooks , and wikinews . "
freedom of speech is critical for all cultures " jimmy wales , wikimedia foundation preserving the essence of the net " wikinews was born out of observation that when any major news ever happens , wikipedia becomes a very valuable resource for people . "
" what you do n't get in the mainstream media is so much of the background material .
so you can come to wikipedia and get a lot of background , " said mr wales .
a good example of that was after the asian tsunami .
people visited wikipedia to search for information about the phenomenon .
but eyewitness videos and images were also published on blogs and photo sharing websites , and collected and used by mainstream news organisations .
wikicommons is an attempt to aggregate all that content to make it accessible to anyone , even mainstream media , anywhere , for free , under free licence terms .
it collects all the images , sound , and video that are all freely licensed so that they can be used in any kind of cultural context .
it is like an information hub for a " global free culture " , said mr wales .
silencing voices but the issue for an organisation which relies on volunteers and only two full-time employees is making groups outside of the online community aware of it , and to get them using it as part of their projects .
wikipedia now attracts roughly more than 2.4 billion hits a month , running on more than 120 servers globally , managed by volunteers who communicate via internet chat .
it says it has a broader reach than the los angeles times , new york times , msnbc.com and the chicago tribune , collectively .
however , there are still big barriers to making the foundation 's efforts truly global .
" freedom of speech is critical for all cultures , " said mr wales .
but in cultures where there are oppressive regimes , the voice of people , no matter what their political stance , is not being expressed at all .
" one of the things we see in wikipedia is that by silencing your own citizens , you are not only preventing them from reading information from outside , but you are also silencing the information that comes out .
access to wikipedia has recently been blocked by chinese authorities which , mr wales said , has backfired in some senses .
it means people from mainland china can not read or contribute to the chinese wikipedia .
the number of edits on the chinese version since the blocking has dropped by around 40 % , according to mr wales .
" the mainland chinese tend to take a chinese mainland point of view on controversial issues , and the taiwanese take another the taiwanese viewpoint , " he explained .
" hopefully it is just a mistake and it will be unblocked .
it has happened before , " he said .
wikipedia gives people the chance to post articles which they think are of cultural and social importance from their own countries , which people are encouraged to translate into their own languages .
each international-facing wikipedia site features articles on the front page which are culturally relevant .
" we are not talking about dissidents and being critical of the chinese government , " he said , stressing that wikipedia was about having the tools to promote your culture .
