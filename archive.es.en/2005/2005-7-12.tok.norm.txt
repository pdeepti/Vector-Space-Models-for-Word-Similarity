diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2005 murderer takes case to human rights court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gäfgen said his human rights had been violated while in custody the convicted murderer of a prominent banker 's son has lodged a complaint at the european court of human rights over his treatment while in custody .
a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
last december , a frankfurt court found daschner guilty of incitement to coercion and misuse of his office .

2 , 2004 . in his final statement to the court , bouyeri - who showed no emotions throughout the trial and refused to speak - said he felt he owed van gogh 's mother anneke some explanation .
" i have to admit i do not feel for you , i do not feel your pain , i can not - i do n't know what it is like to lose a child , " he said . " i can not feel for you ... because i believe you are a non-believer , " he added .
" i acted out of conviction - not because i hated your son . " bouyeri told the prosecutor that he concurred with the charges against him and the demand for a life sentence .
" i would be cowardly to hide behind -lrb- the right to remain silent -rrb- and have a chance to thus escape the maximum punishment , " he said . " if i had the possibility to do again what i did on november 2 , i would do it all again , " bouyeri added . beyond a life sentence , prosecutors demanded that bouyeri be stripped of his right to vote or stand for election for the rest of his life , " to literally place him outside of our democracy .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .
and it is continuing . "
not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .
but more than that , the authors even carry on a dialog of sorts through their novels .
for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .
upon discovering grass ' writing he was ecstatic , huelle said .
important influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass -lrb- left -rrb- during the filming of " the tin drum " " the first grass books were like a voyage of discovery for me , " he said .
" all of a sudden there was my city , but in another form , unknown to me .
you could say it was a literature of initial contact .
suddenly i could once more envision the playground of my childhood , the streets , the ball fields , all these places .
it was fascinating . "
on the heels of the novel " who was davis weiser ? " came other stories reflecting on the city .
a series of his tales recall the memories of people long dead , an ode to a gdansk and the pomeranian and kashubian areas that no longer exist .
stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .
" previously they were ignored , as if they did n't exist .
as if an extremely old , primal polish area had been recaptured .
which is total nonsense and historically inaccurate .
in both countries -lrb- germany and poland -rrb- there are and always have been nationalists who will take this approach .
this can not be ignored , it has to be addressed . "
cult figure grass has caused an uproar with his books and his appearances in gdansk .
he accepts the fact that he has become a cult figure .
" we live in such a speedy era .
everything goes so quickly , and functions via modern technology .
literature assumes that there are readers , its not something that can be delegated .
you have to read yourself .
writing is just scribbles on a page that have to be brought to life by the reader .
and if i can get people to read with my books - especially here -lrb- in poland -rrb- - then i am particularly happy about it .

a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
last december , a frankfurt court found daschner guilty of incitement to coercion and misuse of his office .
but , he was given a lenient sentence and has since been transferred to a different division of hesse 's police . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police chief fined in torture case former frankfurt deputy police chief wolfgang daschner received a suspended sentence of a € 10,800 -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for threatening to torture the suspected kidnapper of a young boy who had already been killed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds clarke said the " complex and intensive " investigation was " moving at great speed " , following raids on six premises in the industrial city of leeds , in the north of england , home to a large muslim population of south asian origin . he said a man - identity and age not revealed - was arrested in west yorkshire , the county in northern england that he was being transferred to london for questioning .
closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .
there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .
bildunterschrift : metropolitan police officers from london meanwhile , hundreds of police are currently involved in searching for the perpetrators of thursday 's blasts .
they need to scrutinize tapes from 2,500 security cameras and wade through tips called in by some 2,000 informants .
coming soon : photos according to the financial times newspaper , investigators are getting closer to identifying those responsible for the blast that ripped through a double decker bus .
" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .
forensic experts were especially interested in identifying two of the people who died on the bus .
they are suspected of having brought the bomb aboard , since they appeared to have been carrying or sitting on top of the explosives , the times wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking wounded being treated at the london hilton metropole after the explosion at edgware road tube station experts are hoping to reach conclusions about the types of bombs that were used based on evidence found at the sites .
they hope this will lead them to the suspects .
they have said the attacks may have been carried out using military type explosives .
the death count from the thursday explosions now stands at 52 with some 700 injured , but the numbers are expected to rise .
in london , stringent security measures are in place , even if they made it hard for people to return to business as usual . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk police defend birmingham evacuation only days after deadly bomb attacks in london , some 20,000 people were evacuated from birmingham overnight saturday as police reacted to a " credible threat " to the central english city .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism economy set to dominate german election unemployment europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 the world according to merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promising " closer consultation " with the us - whatever that means what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?
most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .

-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .

a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 un reform sparks heavy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cold wind is blowing at the un tensions ran high during the first day of debates at the united nations on security council enlargement .
diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism economy set to dominate german election unemployment europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 the world according to merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promising " closer consultation " with the us - whatever that means what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?
most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .

"
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .

" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .

argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .

a pair of german pilots went to great heights to get the perfect snapshot .
unfortunately , a case of mistaken identity means the duo is likely to start experiencing some career turbulence . the pilot of a condor airlines plane gave new meaning to the term ' zoom lens ' when he diverted from his authorized flight path to swoop in on a planeload of brits en route to holidays in canada .
his aim ?
to take a picture of the other plane 's pilot , a friend who was making his final flight .
unfortunately , the german pilot was a mere 200 meters -lrb- 600 feet -rrb- away from the thomas cook airlines boeing 757 before he realized the colleague , whose last flight he so badly wanted to commemorate , was in fact at the controls of a different plane , some 160 kilometers further ahead .
the captain of the british airliner was forced to veer out of the way , 10,000 meters -lrb- 30,000 feet -rrb- in the air above the canadian coast .
quick maneuver the condor captain , with 234 passengers on board , and a co-pilot have been suspended , the press association said .
the german plane , flying from frankfurt to toronto , broke aircraft separation rules by flying so close to the british airliner , whose pilot reported the incident to canadian air traffic controllers and to the uk 's civil aviation authority .
the thomas cook plane was carrying 187 passengers from gatwick to toronto .
a thomas cook spokeswoman said : " our crew were flying on an agreed track when all of a sudden they got a warning on their tcas collision avoidance system that another aircraft had entered their airspace . ...
the captain carried out a textbook-style maneuver , taking the thomas cook aircraft out of danger and on to a higher flight path . "
a spokesman for condor acknowledged that two pilots were suspended , but would not comment on the truth of the allegations that the incident came about because of a photograph attempt .
he also did n't say whether the picture came out clear or blurry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cheap airlines reach the sky 's limits once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .

taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .
-lrb- july 11 , 2005 -rrb- vote on security council expansion looms germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on expanding the un security council - meant to include themselves .
the un general assembly could vote on the issue as early as mid-july .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds clarke said the " complex and intensive " investigation was " moving at great speed " , following raids on six premises in the industrial city of leeds , in the north of england , home to a large muslim population of south asian origin . he said a man - identity and age not revealed - was arrested in west yorkshire , the county in northern england that he was being transferred to london for questioning .
closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .

there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 un reform sparks heavy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cold wind is blowing at the un tensions ran high during the first day of debates at the united nations on security council enlargement .
diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .

a pair of german pilots went to great heights to get the perfect snapshot .
unfortunately , a case of mistaken identity means the duo is likely to start experiencing some career turbulence . the pilot of a condor airlines plane gave new meaning to the term ' zoom lens ' when he diverted from his authorized flight path to swoop in on a planeload of brits en route to holidays in canada .

unfortunately , the german pilot was a mere 200 meters -lrb- 600 feet -rrb- away from the thomas cook airlines boeing 757 before he realized the colleague , whose last flight he so badly wanted to commemorate , was in fact at the controls of a different plane , some 160 kilometers further ahead .
the captain of the british airliner was forced to veer out of the way , 10,000 meters -lrb- 30,000 feet -rrb- in the air above the canadian coast .
quick maneuver the condor captain , with 234 passengers on board , and a co-pilot have been suspended , the press association said .
the german plane , flying from frankfurt to toronto , broke aircraft separation rules by flying so close to the british airliner , whose pilot reported the incident to canadian air traffic controllers and to the uk 's civil aviation authority .
the thomas cook plane was carrying 187 passengers from gatwick to toronto .
a thomas cook spokeswoman said : " our crew were flying on an agreed track when all of a sudden they got a warning on their tcas collision avoidance system that another aircraft had entered their airspace . ...
the captain carried out a textbook-style maneuver , taking the thomas cook aircraft out of danger and on to a higher flight path . "
a spokesman for condor acknowledged that two pilots were suspended , but would not comment on the truth of the allegations that the incident came about because of a photograph attempt .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism economy set to dominate german election unemployment europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 the world according to merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promising " closer consultation " with the us - whatever that means what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?
most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .

" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.

a pair of german pilots went to great heights to get the perfect snapshot .
unfortunately , a case of mistaken identity means the duo is likely to start experiencing some career turbulence . the pilot of a condor airlines plane gave new meaning to the term ' zoom lens ' when he diverted from his authorized flight path to swoop in on a planeload of brits en route to holidays in canada .
his aim ?
to take a picture of the other plane 's pilot , a friend who was making his final flight .
unfortunately , the german pilot was a mere 200 meters -lrb- 600 feet -rrb- away from the thomas cook airlines boeing 757 before he realized the colleague , whose last flight he so badly wanted to commemorate , was in fact at the controls of a different plane , some 160 kilometers further ahead .
the captain of the british airliner was forced to veer out of the way , 10,000 meters -lrb- 30,000 feet -rrb- in the air above the canadian coast .
quick maneuver the condor captain , with 234 passengers on board , and a co-pilot have been suspended , the press association said .
the german plane , flying from frankfurt to toronto , broke aircraft separation rules by flying so close to the british airliner , whose pilot reported the incident to canadian air traffic controllers and to the uk 's civil aviation authority .
the thomas cook plane was carrying 187 passengers from gatwick to toronto .

a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .

a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .

most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .

"
but there has been some criticism from the continent . in his first address to the house of commons since thursday 's attacks , british prime minister tony blair made it clear that britain is made of stern stuff , and would not be brought to its knees by this act of terror which has so far claimed 52 lives . " we express our revulsion at this murderous carnage of the innocent .
we sent our deep and abiding sympathy and prayers to the victims and their families .
we are united in our determination that our country will not be defeated by such terror but will defeat it and emerge from this horror with our values , our way of life , our tolerance and respect for others , undiminished , " blair said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers as a token of shared grief he praised the " stoicism , reslilience and sheer undaunted spirit " of londoners , who he said had responded to the attacks with " a defiance and strength that are universally admired . "
but the spaniards , who were the victims of a similar attack in madrid at the beginning of last year , have also expressed a sense of incredulity at the speed at which londoners seem to be putting the events behind them . spanish daily el pais told its readers " in continental europe , and especially in the south , cathartic ceremonies are needed to stave off panic .
london buries its dead as it always has , simulating relative indifference and displaying normality , " the paper said . " democratic responsibility " but londoners are neither strangers to bomb attacks , nor do they share the outwardly expressive spanish temperament .

a pair of german pilots went to great heights to get the perfect snapshot .
unfortunately , a case of mistaken identity means the duo is likely to start experiencing some career turbulence . the pilot of a condor airlines plane gave new meaning to the term ' zoom lens ' when he diverted from his authorized flight path to swoop in on a planeload of brits en route to holidays in canada .
his aim ?
to take a picture of the other plane 's pilot , a friend who was making his final flight .
unfortunately , the german pilot was a mere 200 meters -lrb- 600 feet -rrb- away from the thomas cook airlines boeing 757 before he realized the colleague , whose last flight he so badly wanted to commemorate , was in fact at the controls of a different plane , some 160 kilometers further ahead .
the captain of the british airliner was forced to veer out of the way , 10,000 meters -lrb- 30,000 feet -rrb- in the air above the canadian coast .
quick maneuver the condor captain , with 234 passengers on board , and a co-pilot have been suspended , the press association said .
the german plane , flying from frankfurt to toronto , broke aircraft separation rules by flying so close to the british airliner , whose pilot reported the incident to canadian air traffic controllers and to the uk 's civil aviation authority .
the thomas cook plane was carrying 187 passengers from gatwick to toronto .
a thomas cook spokeswoman said : " our crew were flying on an agreed track when all of a sudden they got a warning on their tcas collision avoidance system that another aircraft had entered their airspace . ...
the captain carried out a textbook-style maneuver , taking the thomas cook aircraft out of danger and on to a higher flight path . "
a spokesman for condor acknowledged that two pilots were suspended , but would not comment on the truth of the allegations that the incident came about because of a photograph attempt .
he also did n't say whether the picture came out clear or blurry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cheap airlines reach the sky 's limits once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds clarke said the " complex and intensive " investigation was " moving at great speed " , following raids on six premises in the industrial city of leeds , in the north of england , home to a large muslim population of south asian origin . he said a man - identity and age not revealed - was arrested in west yorkshire , the county in northern england that he was being transferred to london for questioning .
closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .
there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .
bildunterschrift : metropolitan police officers from london meanwhile , hundreds of police are currently involved in searching for the perpetrators of thursday 's blasts .
they need to scrutinize tapes from 2,500 security cameras and wade through tips called in by some 2,000 informants .
coming soon : photos according to the financial times newspaper , investigators are getting closer to identifying those responsible for the blast that ripped through a double decker bus .
" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .
forensic experts were especially interested in identifying two of the people who died on the bus .
they are suspected of having brought the bomb aboard , since they appeared to have been carrying or sitting on top of the explosives , the times wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking wounded being treated at the london hilton metropole after the explosion at edgware road tube station experts are hoping to reach conclusions about the types of bombs that were used based on evidence found at the sites .
they hope this will lead them to the suspects .
they have said the attacks may have been carried out using military type explosives .
the death count from the thursday explosions now stands at 52 with some 700 injured , but the numbers are expected to rise .
in london , stringent security measures are in place , even if they made it hard for people to return to business as usual . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk police defend birmingham evacuation only days after deadly bomb attacks in london , some 20,000 people were evacuated from birmingham overnight saturday as police reacted to a " credible threat " to the central english city .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .

brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .

argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds clarke said the " complex and intensive " investigation was " moving at great speed " , following raids on six premises in the industrial city of leeds , in the north of england , home to a large muslim population of south asian origin . he said a man - identity and age not revealed - was arrested in west yorkshire , the county in northern england that he was being transferred to london for questioning .
closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .
there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .
bildunterschrift : metropolitan police officers from london meanwhile , hundreds of police are currently involved in searching for the perpetrators of thursday 's blasts .
they need to scrutinize tapes from 2,500 security cameras and wade through tips called in by some 2,000 informants .
coming soon : photos according to the financial times newspaper , investigators are getting closer to identifying those responsible for the blast that ripped through a double decker bus .
" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .
forensic experts were especially interested in identifying two of the people who died on the bus .
they are suspected of having brought the bomb aboard , since they appeared to have been carrying or sitting on top of the explosives , the times wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking wounded being treated at the london hilton metropole after the explosion at edgware road tube station experts are hoping to reach conclusions about the types of bombs that were used based on evidence found at the sites .
they hope this will lead them to the suspects .
they have said the attacks may have been carried out using military type explosives .
the death count from the thursday explosions now stands at 52 with some 700 injured , but the numbers are expected to rise .
in london , stringent security measures are in place , even if they made it hard for people to return to business as usual . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk police defend birmingham evacuation only days after deadly bomb attacks in london , some 20,000 people were evacuated from birmingham overnight saturday as police reacted to a " credible threat " to the central english city .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .

closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .

taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .

" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .

a court in the southern city of stuttgart has ruled that the massive discounter has to increase its stock levels . lidl was accused by a competition watchdog of enticing shoppers through its doors under false pretences .
the court referred to a case of lidl running a large-scale advertisement for a computer and keyboard , which implied that stocks were ample .
in actual fact , on the day the promotional announcement appeared in the paper , the products in question were sold out by nine in the morning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not only toilet paper and bananas are for daily use the court says the discounter broke an existing law under which shops have to store enough " products for daily use " to keep customers supplied for two days .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .
and it is continuing . "
not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .
but more than that , the authors even carry on a dialog of sorts through their novels .
for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .
upon discovering grass ' writing he was ecstatic , huelle said .

on the heels of the novel " who was davis weiser ? " came other stories reflecting on the city .
a series of his tales recall the memories of people long dead , an ode to a gdansk and the pomeranian and kashubian areas that no longer exist .
stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .
" previously they were ignored , as if they did n't exist .
as if an extremely old , primal polish area had been recaptured .
which is total nonsense and historically inaccurate .
in both countries -lrb- germany and poland -rrb- there are and always have been nationalists who will take this approach .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .

" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .

not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .
but more than that , the authors even carry on a dialog of sorts through their novels .
for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .

stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .

a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
last december , a frankfurt court found daschner guilty of incitement to coercion and misuse of his office .
but , he was given a lenient sentence and has since been transferred to a different division of hesse 's police . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police chief fined in torture case former frankfurt deputy police chief wolfgang daschner received a suspended sentence of a € 10,800 -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for threatening to torture the suspected kidnapper of a young boy who had already been killed .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .
and it is continuing . "
not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .
but more than that , the authors even carry on a dialog of sorts through their novels .
for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .
upon discovering grass ' writing he was ecstatic , huelle said .
important influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass -lrb- left -rrb- during the filming of " the tin drum " " the first grass books were like a voyage of discovery for me , " he said .
" all of a sudden there was my city , but in another form , unknown to me .
you could say it was a literature of initial contact .
suddenly i could once more envision the playground of my childhood , the streets , the ball fields , all these places .
it was fascinating . "
on the heels of the novel " who was davis weiser ? " came other stories reflecting on the city .
a series of his tales recall the memories of people long dead , an ode to a gdansk and the pomeranian and kashubian areas that no longer exist .
stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .
" previously they were ignored , as if they did n't exist .
as if an extremely old , primal polish area had been recaptured .
which is total nonsense and historically inaccurate .
in both countries -lrb- germany and poland -rrb- there are and always have been nationalists who will take this approach .
this can not be ignored , it has to be addressed . "
cult figure grass has caused an uproar with his books and his appearances in gdansk .
he accepts the fact that he has become a cult figure .
" we live in such a speedy era .
everything goes so quickly , and functions via modern technology .
literature assumes that there are readers , its not something that can be delegated .
you have to read yourself .
writing is just scribbles on a page that have to be brought to life by the reader .

a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .

a pair of german pilots went to great heights to get the perfect snapshot .
unfortunately , a case of mistaken identity means the duo is likely to start experiencing some career turbulence . the pilot of a condor airlines plane gave new meaning to the term ' zoom lens ' when he diverted from his authorized flight path to swoop in on a planeload of brits en route to holidays in canada .
his aim ?
to take a picture of the other plane 's pilot , a friend who was making his final flight .
unfortunately , the german pilot was a mere 200 meters -lrb- 600 feet -rrb- away from the thomas cook airlines boeing 757 before he realized the colleague , whose last flight he so badly wanted to commemorate , was in fact at the controls of a different plane , some 160 kilometers further ahead .
the captain of the british airliner was forced to veer out of the way , 10,000 meters -lrb- 30,000 feet -rrb- in the air above the canadian coast .
quick maneuver the condor captain , with 234 passengers on board , and a co-pilot have been suspended , the press association said .
the german plane , flying from frankfurt to toronto , broke aircraft separation rules by flying so close to the british airliner , whose pilot reported the incident to canadian air traffic controllers and to the uk 's civil aviation authority .
the thomas cook plane was carrying 187 passengers from gatwick to toronto .
a thomas cook spokeswoman said : " our crew were flying on an agreed track when all of a sudden they got a warning on their tcas collision avoidance system that another aircraft had entered their airspace . ...
the captain carried out a textbook-style maneuver , taking the thomas cook aircraft out of danger and on to a higher flight path . "
a spokesman for condor acknowledged that two pilots were suspended , but would not comment on the truth of the allegations that the incident came about because of a photograph attempt .
he also did n't say whether the picture came out clear or blurry . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cheap airlines reach the sky 's limits once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .

a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 un reform sparks heavy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cold wind is blowing at the un tensions ran high during the first day of debates at the united nations on security council enlargement .
diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .
-lrb- july 11 , 2005 -rrb- vote on security council expansion looms germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on expanding the un security council - meant to include themselves .
the un general assembly could vote on the issue as early as mid-july .
-lrb- july 7 , 2005 -rrb- bush boosts un seat hopes for germany bush and schröder 's meeting in june highlighted a new warmth in us-german relations , as the us president promised he would not block a german bid for a permanent seat on the un security council .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .

most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds clarke said the " complex and intensive " investigation was " moving at great speed " , following raids on six premises in the industrial city of leeds , in the north of england , home to a large muslim population of south asian origin . he said a man - identity and age not revealed - was arrested in west yorkshire , the county in northern england that he was being transferred to london for questioning .
closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .
there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .
bildunterschrift : metropolitan police officers from london meanwhile , hundreds of police are currently involved in searching for the perpetrators of thursday 's blasts .
they need to scrutinize tapes from 2,500 security cameras and wade through tips called in by some 2,000 informants .
coming soon : photos according to the financial times newspaper , investigators are getting closer to identifying those responsible for the blast that ripped through a double decker bus .
" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .
forensic experts were especially interested in identifying two of the people who died on the bus .
they are suspected of having brought the bomb aboard , since they appeared to have been carrying or sitting on top of the explosives , the times wrote .

they hope this will lead them to the suspects .
they have said the attacks may have been carried out using military type explosives .
the death count from the thursday explosions now stands at 52 with some 700 injured , but the numbers are expected to rise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 un reform sparks heavy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cold wind is blowing at the un tensions ran high during the first day of debates at the united nations on security council enlargement .
diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .
-lrb- july 11 , 2005 -rrb- vote on security council expansion looms germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on expanding the un security council - meant to include themselves .
the un general assembly could vote on the issue as early as mid-july .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds clarke said the " complex and intensive " investigation was " moving at great speed " , following raids on six premises in the industrial city of leeds , in the north of england , home to a large muslim population of south asian origin . he said a man - identity and age not revealed - was arrested in west yorkshire , the county in northern england that he was being transferred to london for questioning .
closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .
there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .
bildunterschrift : metropolitan police officers from london meanwhile , hundreds of police are currently involved in searching for the perpetrators of thursday 's blasts .
they need to scrutinize tapes from 2,500 security cameras and wade through tips called in by some 2,000 informants .
coming soon : photos according to the financial times newspaper , investigators are getting closer to identifying those responsible for the blast that ripped through a double decker bus .
" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .
forensic experts were especially interested in identifying two of the people who died on the bus .
they are suspected of having brought the bomb aboard , since they appeared to have been carrying or sitting on top of the explosives , the times wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking wounded being treated at the london hilton metropole after the explosion at edgware road tube station experts are hoping to reach conclusions about the types of bombs that were used based on evidence found at the sites .
they hope this will lead them to the suspects .
they have said the attacks may have been carried out using military type explosives .
the death count from the thursday explosions now stands at 52 with some 700 injured , but the numbers are expected to rise .
in london , stringent security measures are in place , even if they made it hard for people to return to business as usual . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk police defend birmingham evacuation only days after deadly bomb attacks in london , some 20,000 people were evacuated from birmingham overnight saturday as police reacted to a " credible threat " to the central english city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election issues : what 's at stake a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
germany 's long road to multiculturalism economy set to dominate german election unemployment europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 the world according to merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promising " closer consultation " with the us - whatever that means what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?
most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

"
but there has been some criticism from the continent . in his first address to the house of commons since thursday 's attacks , british prime minister tony blair made it clear that britain is made of stern stuff , and would not be brought to its knees by this act of terror which has so far claimed 52 lives . " we express our revulsion at this murderous carnage of the innocent .
we sent our deep and abiding sympathy and prayers to the victims and their families .
we are united in our determination that our country will not be defeated by such terror but will defeat it and emerge from this horror with our values , our way of life , our tolerance and respect for others , undiminished , " blair said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers as a token of shared grief he praised the " stoicism , reslilience and sheer undaunted spirit " of londoners , who he said had responded to the attacks with " a defiance and strength that are universally admired . "
but the spaniards , who were the victims of a similar attack in madrid at the beginning of last year , have also expressed a sense of incredulity at the speed at which londoners seem to be putting the events behind them . spanish daily el pais told its readers " in continental europe , and especially in the south , cathartic ceremonies are needed to stave off panic .
london buries its dead as it always has , simulating relative indifference and displaying normality , " the paper said . " democratic responsibility " but londoners are neither strangers to bomb attacks , nor do they share the outwardly expressive spanish temperament .
in its editorial , el mundo daily , said that " in the midst of commotion and anguish for the cruel blow received , the response has been one of civic maturity and democratic responsibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photographs of some of the missing passengers there has also been criticism in the spanish press at the length of time it is taking the british authorities to identify the dead .
while most of the 190 people killed in the madrid bombings had been identified within three days of the attacks , there are still a number of relatives in britain desperate to know the truth about their missing loved ones . but in his parliamentary address , tony blair stressed the difficulties involved in the process .
" the police are proceeding here with some caution .
in previous terrorist attacks of a similar kind in other countries , mistakes have been made which are incredibly distressing , " he said .
" i wish it could be quicker but i think the only wise course is to follow precisely the advice of the coroner and police and that is what we will do . " strategic planning as london does what it can to continue its return to normality , the eu justice and interior ministers are scheduled to meet on wednesday to boost an eu-wide action plan to continue the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair although the talks are not expected to yield any new initiatives , it is widely expected that britain , which took over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , will put pressure on the union to approve plans to strengthen protection of key infrastructure targets such as transport and energy networks . britain is also calling for introducing a regulations to oblige telecommunications companies to retain for one year records detailing customers ' call and e-mail correspondents and the internet sites they visit .
but the plan has drawn widespread criticism from companies , complaining about the implied costs , and from civil liberties groups , who claim it would violate the right to privacy . british home secretary charles clarke also wants eu ministers to pass an " evidence warrant " which would facilitate the inter-european exchange of evidence to be used in court cases . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain still looking for bombing leads the search continued friday for the terrorists whose work killed over 50 people and injured more than 700 in a series of explosions on the london public transportation system .

gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .

stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .

sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .

argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .

most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .
and it is continuing . "
not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .

for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .
upon discovering grass ' writing he was ecstatic , huelle said .
important influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass -lrb- left -rrb- during the filming of " the tin drum " " the first grass books were like a voyage of discovery for me , " he said .
" all of a sudden there was my city , but in another form , unknown to me .
you could say it was a literature of initial contact .
suddenly i could once more envision the playground of my childhood , the streets , the ball fields , all these places .
it was fascinating . "
on the heels of the novel " who was davis weiser ? " came other stories reflecting on the city .
a series of his tales recall the memories of people long dead , an ode to a gdansk and the pomeranian and kashubian areas that no longer exist .
stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .
" previously they were ignored , as if they did n't exist .
as if an extremely old , primal polish area had been recaptured .
which is total nonsense and historically inaccurate .
in both countries -lrb- germany and poland -rrb- there are and always have been nationalists who will take this approach .
this can not be ignored , it has to be addressed . "
cult figure grass has caused an uproar with his books and his appearances in gdansk .
he accepts the fact that he has become a cult figure .
" we live in such a speedy era .
everything goes so quickly , and functions via modern technology .
literature assumes that there are readers , its not something that can be delegated .
you have to read yourself .
writing is just scribbles on a page that have to be brought to life by the reader .
and if i can get people to read with my books - especially here -lrb- in poland -rrb- - then i am particularly happy about it .

a court in the southern city of stuttgart has ruled that the massive discounter has to increase its stock levels . lidl was accused by a competition watchdog of enticing shoppers through its doors under false pretences .
the court referred to a case of lidl running a large-scale advertisement for a computer and keyboard , which implied that stocks were ample .
in actual fact , on the day the promotional announcement appeared in the paper , the products in question were sold out by nine in the morning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not only toilet paper and bananas are for daily use the court says the discounter broke an existing law under which shops have to store enough " products for daily use " to keep customers supplied for two days .
computers fall under that category . missing the loophole retailers can slip through the loopholes in the law without too much difficulty if they can prove either that they had to sell the product in question in a shorter period of time than generally required by the law , or if they can show that there was an unexpected interest in what they were selling . but lidl did neither . in fact , the discount supermarket argued that customers would not expect to find great stocks of such cheap products , but would likely know that they would sell out very quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train tickets were a popular sell but the court countered that " customers do not expect to have to stand in a queue before the store opens in order to be one of the lucky few people to buy the product . " the competition watchdog has also brought charges against lidl for selling train tickets in the same vein .
stores in germany recently sold more than a million train tickets at cheap rate prices . but , with each branch selling an average of between just 150 - 250 tickets , they too were sold out in record time . the trial date has not yet been set . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds clarke said the " complex and intensive " investigation was " moving at great speed " , following raids on six premises in the industrial city of leeds , in the north of england , home to a large muslim population of south asian origin . he said a man - identity and age not revealed - was arrested in west yorkshire , the county in northern england that he was being transferred to london for questioning .
closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .
there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .
bildunterschrift : metropolitan police officers from london meanwhile , hundreds of police are currently involved in searching for the perpetrators of thursday 's blasts .
they need to scrutinize tapes from 2,500 security cameras and wade through tips called in by some 2,000 informants .
coming soon : photos according to the financial times newspaper , investigators are getting closer to identifying those responsible for the blast that ripped through a double decker bus .
" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .
forensic experts were especially interested in identifying two of the people who died on the bus .
they are suspected of having brought the bomb aboard , since they appeared to have been carrying or sitting on top of the explosives , the times wrote .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .
and it is continuing . "
not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .
but more than that , the authors even carry on a dialog of sorts through their novels .
for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .
upon discovering grass ' writing he was ecstatic , huelle said .

on the heels of the novel " who was davis weiser ? " came other stories reflecting on the city .
a series of his tales recall the memories of people long dead , an ode to a gdansk and the pomeranian and kashubian areas that no longer exist .
stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .
" previously they were ignored , as if they did n't exist .
as if an extremely old , primal polish area had been recaptured .
which is total nonsense and historically inaccurate .
in both countries -lrb- germany and poland -rrb- there are and always have been nationalists who will take this approach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2005 murderer takes case to human rights court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gäfgen said his human rights had been violated while in custody the convicted murderer of a prominent banker 's son has lodged a complaint at the european court of human rights over his treatment while in custody .
a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .
last december , a frankfurt court found daschner guilty of incitement to coercion and misuse of his office .
but , he was given a lenient sentence and has since been transferred to a different division of hesse 's police . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police chief fined in torture case former frankfurt deputy police chief wolfgang daschner received a suspended sentence of a € 10,800 -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for threatening to torture the suspected kidnapper of a young boy who had already been killed .

a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism economy set to dominate german election unemployment europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 the world according to merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promising " closer consultation " with the us - whatever that means what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?
most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- turkey worried about german elections germans are not the only ones whose fates lay in the balance of early federal elections .
with the conservatives in power in berlin , turkey would lose a staunch supporter of its bid to join the eu .

a court in the southern city of stuttgart has ruled that the massive discounter has to increase its stock levels . lidl was accused by a competition watchdog of enticing shoppers through its doors under false pretences .
the court referred to a case of lidl running a large-scale advertisement for a computer and keyboard , which implied that stocks were ample .
in actual fact , on the day the promotional announcement appeared in the paper , the products in question were sold out by nine in the morning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not only toilet paper and bananas are for daily use the court says the discounter broke an existing law under which shops have to store enough " products for daily use " to keep customers supplied for two days .
computers fall under that category . missing the loophole retailers can slip through the loopholes in the law without too much difficulty if they can prove either that they had to sell the product in question in a shorter period of time than generally required by the law , or if they can show that there was an unexpected interest in what they were selling . but lidl did neither . in fact , the discount supermarket argued that customers would not expect to find great stocks of such cheap products , but would likely know that they would sell out very quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train tickets were a popular sell but the court countered that " customers do not expect to have to stand in a queue before the store opens in order to be one of the lucky few people to buy the product . " the competition watchdog has also brought charges against lidl for selling train tickets in the same vein .
stores in germany recently sold more than a million train tickets at cheap rate prices . but , with each branch selling an average of between just 150 - 250 tickets , they too were sold out in record time . the trial date has not yet been set . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

"
but there has been some criticism from the continent . in his first address to the house of commons since thursday 's attacks , british prime minister tony blair made it clear that britain is made of stern stuff , and would not be brought to its knees by this act of terror which has so far claimed 52 lives . " we express our revulsion at this murderous carnage of the innocent .
we sent our deep and abiding sympathy and prayers to the victims and their families .
we are united in our determination that our country will not be defeated by such terror but will defeat it and emerge from this horror with our values , our way of life , our tolerance and respect for others , undiminished , " blair said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers as a token of shared grief he praised the " stoicism , reslilience and sheer undaunted spirit " of londoners , who he said had responded to the attacks with " a defiance and strength that are universally admired . "
but the spaniards , who were the victims of a similar attack in madrid at the beginning of last year , have also expressed a sense of incredulity at the speed at which londoners seem to be putting the events behind them . spanish daily el pais told its readers " in continental europe , and especially in the south , cathartic ceremonies are needed to stave off panic .
london buries its dead as it always has , simulating relative indifference and displaying normality , " the paper said . " democratic responsibility " but londoners are neither strangers to bomb attacks , nor do they share the outwardly expressive spanish temperament .
in its editorial , el mundo daily , said that " in the midst of commotion and anguish for the cruel blow received , the response has been one of civic maturity and democratic responsibility . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photographs of some of the missing passengers there has also been criticism in the spanish press at the length of time it is taking the british authorities to identify the dead .
while most of the 190 people killed in the madrid bombings had been identified within three days of the attacks , there are still a number of relatives in britain desperate to know the truth about their missing loved ones . but in his parliamentary address , tony blair stressed the difficulties involved in the process .
" the police are proceeding here with some caution .
in previous terrorist attacks of a similar kind in other countries , mistakes have been made which are incredibly distressing , " he said .
" i wish it could be quicker but i think the only wise course is to follow precisely the advice of the coroner and police and that is what we will do . " strategic planning as london does what it can to continue its return to normality , the eu justice and interior ministers are scheduled to meet on wednesday to boost an eu-wide action plan to continue the fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair although the talks are not expected to yield any new initiatives , it is widely expected that britain , which took over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , will put pressure on the union to approve plans to strengthen protection of key infrastructure targets such as transport and energy networks . britain is also calling for introducing a regulations to oblige telecommunications companies to retain for one year records detailing customers ' call and e-mail correspondents and the internet sites they visit .
but the plan has drawn widespread criticism from companies , complaining about the implied costs , and from civil liberties groups , who claim it would violate the right to privacy . british home secretary charles clarke also wants eu ministers to pass an " evidence warrant " which would facilitate the inter-european exchange of evidence to be used in court cases . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain still looking for bombing leads the search continued friday for the terrorists whose work killed over 50 people and injured more than 700 in a series of explosions on the london public transportation system .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .

closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .
there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .

coming soon : photos according to the financial times newspaper , investigators are getting closer to identifying those responsible for the blast that ripped through a double decker bus .
" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .
forensic experts were especially interested in identifying two of the people who died on the bus .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds clarke said the " complex and intensive " investigation was " moving at great speed " , following raids on six premises in the industrial city of leeds , in the north of england , home to a large muslim population of south asian origin . he said a man - identity and age not revealed - was arrested in west yorkshire , the county in northern england that he was being transferred to london for questioning .
closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .
there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .
bildunterschrift : metropolitan police officers from london meanwhile , hundreds of police are currently involved in searching for the perpetrators of thursday 's blasts .
they need to scrutinize tapes from 2,500 security cameras and wade through tips called in by some 2,000 informants .
coming soon : photos according to the financial times newspaper , investigators are getting closer to identifying those responsible for the blast that ripped through a double decker bus .
" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .
forensic experts were especially interested in identifying two of the people who died on the bus .
they are suspected of having brought the bomb aboard , since they appeared to have been carrying or sitting on top of the explosives , the times wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking wounded being treated at the london hilton metropole after the explosion at edgware road tube station experts are hoping to reach conclusions about the types of bombs that were used based on evidence found at the sites .
they hope this will lead them to the suspects .
they have said the attacks may have been carried out using military type explosives .
the death count from the thursday explosions now stands at 52 with some 700 injured , but the numbers are expected to rise .

a court in the southern city of stuttgart has ruled that the massive discounter has to increase its stock levels . lidl was accused by a competition watchdog of enticing shoppers through its doors under false pretences .
the court referred to a case of lidl running a large-scale advertisement for a computer and keyboard , which implied that stocks were ample .
in actual fact , on the day the promotional announcement appeared in the paper , the products in question were sold out by nine in the morning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not only toilet paper and bananas are for daily use the court says the discounter broke an existing law under which shops have to store enough " products for daily use " to keep customers supplied for two days .
computers fall under that category . missing the loophole retailers can slip through the loopholes in the law without too much difficulty if they can prove either that they had to sell the product in question in a shorter period of time than generally required by the law , or if they can show that there was an unexpected interest in what they were selling . but lidl did neither . in fact , the discount supermarket argued that customers would not expect to find great stocks of such cheap products , but would likely know that they would sell out very quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train tickets were a popular sell but the court countered that " customers do not expect to have to stand in a queue before the store opens in order to be one of the lucky few people to buy the product . " the competition watchdog has also brought charges against lidl for selling train tickets in the same vein .
stores in germany recently sold more than a million train tickets at cheap rate prices . but , with each branch selling an average of between just 150 - 250 tickets , they too were sold out in record time . the trial date has not yet been set . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

a pair of german pilots went to great heights to get the perfect snapshot .
unfortunately , a case of mistaken identity means the duo is likely to start experiencing some career turbulence . the pilot of a condor airlines plane gave new meaning to the term ' zoom lens ' when he diverted from his authorized flight path to swoop in on a planeload of brits en route to holidays in canada .

the captain of the british airliner was forced to veer out of the way , 10,000 meters -lrb- 30,000 feet -rrb- in the air above the canadian coast .
quick maneuver the condor captain , with 234 passengers on board , and a co-pilot have been suspended , the press association said .
the german plane , flying from frankfurt to toronto , broke aircraft separation rules by flying so close to the british airliner , whose pilot reported the incident to canadian air traffic controllers and to the uk 's civil aviation authority .
the thomas cook plane was carrying 187 passengers from gatwick to toronto .
a thomas cook spokeswoman said : " our crew were flying on an agreed track when all of a sudden they got a warning on their tcas collision avoidance system that another aircraft had entered their airspace . ...
the captain carried out a textbook-style maneuver , taking the thomas cook aircraft out of danger and on to a higher flight path . "
a spokesman for condor acknowledged that two pilots were suspended , but would not comment on the truth of the allegations that the incident came about because of a photograph attempt .

brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .

" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .
and it is continuing . "
not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .
but more than that , the authors even carry on a dialog of sorts through their novels .
for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .

on the heels of the novel " who was davis weiser ? " came other stories reflecting on the city .
a series of his tales recall the memories of people long dead , an ode to a gdansk and the pomeranian and kashubian areas that no longer exist .
stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .
" previously they were ignored , as if they did n't exist .
as if an extremely old , primal polish area had been recaptured .
which is total nonsense and historically inaccurate .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .
and it is continuing . "
not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .
but more than that , the authors even carry on a dialog of sorts through their novels .
for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .
upon discovering grass ' writing he was ecstatic , huelle said .
important influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass -lrb- left -rrb- during the filming of " the tin drum " " the first grass books were like a voyage of discovery for me , " he said .
" all of a sudden there was my city , but in another form , unknown to me .
you could say it was a literature of initial contact .
suddenly i could once more envision the playground of my childhood , the streets , the ball fields , all these places .
it was fascinating . "
on the heels of the novel " who was davis weiser ? " came other stories reflecting on the city .
a series of his tales recall the memories of people long dead , an ode to a gdansk and the pomeranian and kashubian areas that no longer exist .
stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .
" previously they were ignored , as if they did n't exist .
as if an extremely old , primal polish area had been recaptured .
which is total nonsense and historically inaccurate .
in both countries -lrb- germany and poland -rrb- there are and always have been nationalists who will take this approach .
this can not be ignored , it has to be addressed . "
cult figure grass has caused an uproar with his books and his appearances in gdansk .
he accepts the fact that he has become a cult figure .
" we live in such a speedy era .
everything goes so quickly , and functions via modern technology .
literature assumes that there are readers , its not something that can be delegated .
you have to read yourself .
writing is just scribbles on a page that have to be brought to life by the reader .
and if i can get people to read with my books - especially here -lrb- in poland -rrb- - then i am particularly happy about it .

most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 investigation of london bombings heats up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds british police declared their first arrest tuesday in connection with the london bombings and said at least one bomber is confirmed to have been killed as the pieces began to fall together in a fast-moving probe . british police said tuesday they believed they had identified four suspects over the bombings and that it was " very likely " one of the men who carried out the attacks last thursday was among the dead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police stand guard over a cordon in beeston , near leeds clarke said the " complex and intensive " investigation was " moving at great speed " , following raids on six premises in the industrial city of leeds , in the north of england , home to a large muslim population of south asian origin . he said a man - identity and age not revealed - was arrested in west yorkshire , the county in northern england that he was being transferred to london for questioning .
closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .
there 's no doubt about that . "
meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .
bildunterschrift : metropolitan police officers from london meanwhile , hundreds of police are currently involved in searching for the perpetrators of thursday 's blasts .
they need to scrutinize tapes from 2,500 security cameras and wade through tips called in by some 2,000 informants .
coming soon : photos according to the financial times newspaper , investigators are getting closer to identifying those responsible for the blast that ripped through a double decker bus .
" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .
forensic experts were especially interested in identifying two of the people who died on the bus .
they are suspected of having brought the bomb aboard , since they appeared to have been carrying or sitting on top of the explosives , the times wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walking wounded being treated at the london hilton metropole after the explosion at edgware road tube station experts are hoping to reach conclusions about the types of bombs that were used based on evidence found at the sites .
they hope this will lead them to the suspects .
they have said the attacks may have been carried out using military type explosives .
the death count from the thursday explosions now stands at 52 with some 700 injured , but the numbers are expected to rise .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train which was bombed at aldgate tube station on thursday london 's metropolitan police held back from saying that the blasts - which killed at least 52 people and injured around 700 on three underground subway trains and a double-decker bus - were the work of suicide bombers .
but it emerged that the operation was highly coordinated , with four prime suspects - as yet unnamed - having travelled together to the unsuspecting british capital on the morning of the rush-hour blasts .
" the investigation quite early led us to have concerns about the movement and activities of four men , three of whom came from the west yorkshire area , " said the head of the metropolitan police anti-terrorist squad , peter clarke .
" we are trying to establish their movements in the run-up to last week 's attack and specifically to establish whether they all died in the explosions , " clarke told reporters .
he added that it was " very likely " that one of the suspects was among those who died in one of the bombed underground trains , near aldgate station in east london .

closer to the capital tuesday , police sealed off a train station and parking lot in luton , a city north of london , and carried out a controlled explosion on a car with suspected links to the attacks .
" another attack likely " prime minister tony blair has stated that islamic extremists - possibly with links to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network - are believed to have carried out the bombings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london swings back to normal with daily life in london virtually back to normal tuesday , metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair warned in a bbc interview against complacency , saying : " another attack is likely .

meanwhile , britain launched a two-pronged political offensive on terrorism on tuesday , urging the european union to pass new security laws and pushing member states to crack down on terror funding .
taking advantage of momentum from the international solidarity shown in the wake of last week 's london bombings , britain 's foreign and finance ministers united in saying it was urgent to move now before other attacks occur .
in remarks to a european foreign affairs committee , foreign secretary jack straw called for " a re-balancing of -lrb- where -rrb- the line between the rights of individuals and the rights of societies should lie . "
he urged the eu to rapidly implement its counter-terrorism action plan , ensure more effective police cooperation between member states and accelerate moves to give the authorities access to telephone and internet data .
" i believe that , provided there are proper safeguards , no one 's civil liberties are threatened by retention and access to data , but the protection of everybody is more greatly enhanced , " he said .

" i believe we will be able to publish photos of one or more of the suspects within days , " the paper cited european security officials as saying .

the three germans , an american and an israeli will meet at the beginning of september to determine their pattern of work , expected to last between three and five years .

the decision to set up the committee was made in the spring and followed a controversy at the ministry over tributes paid on their deaths to all diplomats , which included former nazis who had later worked for the west german diplomatic service .
ministry staff have given the project their " wide backing . "
fischer had decided to do away with posthumous tributes to ex-nazi staff after discovering in 2003 a death announcement in an internal newsletter paying homage to former consul-general franz nüsslein , without mentioning he had been a nazi prosecutor .

i acted purely in the name of my religion , " 27-year-old dutch-moroccan national mohammed bouyeri -lrb- photo -rrb- told the court in amsterdam .
" i can assure you that one day , should i be set free , i would do exactly the same , exactly the same , " he said , speaking slowly at times in halting dutch . prosecutors asked that bouyeri be sent to prison for life - a sentence that offers no chance of parole - for shooting and stabbing controversial filmmaker van gogh on nov .
2 , 2004 . in his final statement to the court , bouyeri - who showed no emotions throughout the trial and refused to speak - said he felt he owed van gogh 's mother anneke some explanation .
" i have to admit i do not feel for you , i do not feel your pain , i can not - i do n't know what it is like to lose a child , " he said . " i can not feel for you ... because i believe you are a non-believer , " he added .
" i acted out of conviction - not because i hated your son . " bouyeri told the prosecutor that he concurred with the charges against him and the demand for a life sentence .
" i would be cowardly to hide behind -lrb- the right to remain silent -rrb- and have a chance to thus escape the maximum punishment , " he said . " if i had the possibility to do again what i did on november 2 , i would do it all again , " bouyeri added . beyond a life sentence , prosecutors demanded that bouyeri be stripped of his right to vote or stand for election for the rest of his life , " to literally place him outside of our democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh earlier prosecutor frits van straelen said : " we know that theo van gogh -lrb- photo -rrb- was not a saint . ...

a former top policeman threatened him with torture during questioning . magnus gäfgen , who kidnapped and murdered the young heir to a banking family in 2002 , has taken legal action against germany at the european court of human rights in strasbourg .
in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .

in his 220-page complaint , gäfgen , 30 , accused germany of violating articles three and six of the european convention on human rights .
article three stipulates that no one should be subjected to torture , inhuman or degrading treatment .
article six states that everyone has the right to a fair trial .
gäfgen was sentenced to life in prison in 2003 for kidnapping and killing 11-year-old jakob von metzler .
during his questioning , frankfurt 's former deputy police chief wolfgang daschner had ordered officers to threaten gäfgen with " intense pain " if he did n't reveal where metzler was being held .
gäfgen then told the police where he had hidden the child , who was already dead at the time .
gäfgen faces a long wait a spokeswoman for the court in strasbourg confirmed a report in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel that gäfgen had moved the european court of human rights .
however , gäfgen will have to wait several months before he can expect an initial response from strasbourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of human rights could take months to decide whether to accept gäfgen 's case " it can certainly take months before the court deals with the complaint and decides whether it 's admissible , " the spokeswoman said on tuesday .
if the court accepts the case , legal proceedings can take on average up to four years at the court before a verdict is expected .
gäfgen 's complaint was filed in mid-june .
case could shape proceedings in the future according to gäfgen 's attorney , michael heuchemer , the legal action was primarily aimed at setting a precedent against forcing a confession through torture .
" this would shape case law and the reality of criminal prosecution for decades to come , " der tagesspiegel quoted heuchemer .
in the long-term , gäfgen was not interested in compensation but rather in securing a ruling against germany , which could lead to a retrial , he said .
according to heuchemer , the case represented " the best-known and most easily proven violation of human rights and ban on torture in post-war german history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang daschner said he had hoped to find jakob von metzler alive the disclosure that daschner had threatened to manhandle gäfgen sparked a public debate about police employing torture , which is illegal in germany and can be punished with up to ten years in prison .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism economy set to dominate german election unemployment europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 the world according to merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promising " closer consultation " with the us - whatever that means what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?
most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- turkey worried about german elections germans are not the only ones whose fates lay in the balance of early federal elections .
with the conservatives in power in berlin , turkey would lose a staunch supporter of its bid to join the eu .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .
and it is continuing . "
not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .
but more than that , the authors even carry on a dialog of sorts through their novels .
for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .
upon discovering grass ' writing he was ecstatic , huelle said .
important influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass -lrb- left -rrb- during the filming of " the tin drum " " the first grass books were like a voyage of discovery for me , " he said .
" all of a sudden there was my city , but in another form , unknown to me .
you could say it was a literature of initial contact .
suddenly i could once more envision the playground of my childhood , the streets , the ball fields , all these places .
it was fascinating . "
on the heels of the novel " who was davis weiser ? " came other stories reflecting on the city .
a series of his tales recall the memories of people long dead , an ode to a gdansk and the pomeranian and kashubian areas that no longer exist .
stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .
" previously they were ignored , as if they did n't exist .
as if an extremely old , primal polish area had been recaptured .
which is total nonsense and historically inaccurate .
in both countries -lrb- germany and poland -rrb- there are and always have been nationalists who will take this approach .
this can not be ignored , it has to be addressed . "
cult figure grass has caused an uproar with his books and his appearances in gdansk .
he accepts the fact that he has become a cult figure .
" we live in such a speedy era .
everything goes so quickly , and functions via modern technology .
literature assumes that there are readers , its not something that can be delegated .

during a recent visit , the nobel laureate told deutsche welle about his ties to the polish city and his influence on writers in the region . born in gdansk , connected to gdansk - günter grass 's homeland has given him strength and inspiration for all his works , not just his successful novel " the tin drum . "
gdansk was the scene of several of grass 's novels including his serial trilogy .
his father owned a grocery in danzig - its german name - and his mother was of kashubian origin - slavic people distinct from the poles , both with regards to language and culture , who settled in the area around the city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass in front of his family home in gdansk " in the beginning , i went back to find traces of gdansk , " günter grass said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but over the years and the decades it developed into a strong interest in the history of gdansk , in the postwar history , " the nobel laureate said .
" for example , in the last chapter of my novel " the flounder , " i describe the insurgency in the polish port cities , especially gdansk , where the militia shot at the workers .
that becomes part of the plot .
at that time , i was the only writer who wrote about that .
polish writers could n't write about it .
the censors would n't have allowed it .
i was a sort of surrogate writer for polish literature .
so , my relationship to poland has been there for decades .
and it is continuing . "
not long ago , grass sat down with his translators to discuss a new version of " the tin drum . "
at the same time , he met up with the young polish writer pawel huelle , born in 1957 .
the two have a special connection , and huelle 's works are often compared with those of grass .
both authors write books that reflect gdansk history .
but more than that , the authors even carry on a dialog of sorts through their novels .
for example , huelle 's 1987 novel " who was david weiser ? " takes up a conversation with grass 's novella " cat and mouse . "
huelle credits the early writings of grass for introducing him to the unknown history of gdansk .
upon discovering grass ' writing he was ecstatic , huelle said .
important influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter grass -lrb- left -rrb- during the filming of " the tin drum " " the first grass books were like a voyage of discovery for me , " he said .
" all of a sudden there was my city , but in another form , unknown to me .
you could say it was a literature of initial contact .
suddenly i could once more envision the playground of my childhood , the streets , the ball fields , all these places .
it was fascinating . "
on the heels of the novel " who was davis weiser ? " came other stories reflecting on the city .
a series of his tales recall the memories of people long dead , an ode to a gdansk and the pomeranian and kashubian areas that no longer exist .
stefan chwin , born in 1949 , is another gdansk author who has done his part to uncover the unknown history of the city .
grass believes such literature is an important part of reconciliation .
" here in gdansk there is chwin , there is pawel huelle , who both began very early - still in the communist era - to describe the german history of the city , " grass said .
" previously they were ignored , as if they did n't exist .
as if an extremely old , primal polish area had been recaptured .
which is total nonsense and historically inaccurate .
in both countries -lrb- germany and poland -rrb- there are and always have been nationalists who will take this approach .
this can not be ignored , it has to be addressed . "
cult figure grass has caused an uproar with his books and his appearances in gdansk .
he accepts the fact that he has become a cult figure .
" we live in such a speedy era .
everything goes so quickly , and functions via modern technology .
literature assumes that there are readers , its not something that can be delegated .

the three germans , an american and an israeli will meet at the beginning of september to determine their pattern of work , expected to last between three and five years .
the aim is to produce at the end of it an account of the exact role of the ministry between the arrival in power of hitler in 1933 and the defeat of germany in 1945 .

the decision to set up the committee was made in the spring and followed a controversy at the ministry over tributes paid on their deaths to all diplomats , which included former nazis who had later worked for the west german diplomatic service .
ministry staff have given the project their " wide backing . "
fischer had decided to do away with posthumous tributes to ex-nazi staff after discovering in 2003 a death announcement in an internal newsletter paying homage to former consul-general franz nüsslein , without mentioning he had been a nazi prosecutor .
when some ministry staff protested fischer decided to end all posthumous tributes and just publish death announcements in the staff newsletter . dw-world.de minister rules out nazi probe interior minister schily has rejected allegations that a number of former nazi party members easily got jobs as civil servants in the postwar west german ministry and has rejected an independent probe .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .

diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday . the un general assembly opened a divisive debate monday on a controversial draft resolution by the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - brazil , germany , india and japan - to expand the powerful security council .
but some of their regional rivals are bitterly opposing the initiative .
brazil 's un envoy ronaldo mota sardenberg introduced the g-4 draft on monday .
it calls for enlarging the council from the current 15 members to 25 by creating six new permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats .
sardenberg said the security structure established in 1945 when the un was created was " now glaringly outdated . "
" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .

argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .

" the security council needs to undergo a thorough reform , which includes an expansion of the category of permanent members in order to bring it in line with the contemporary world , " sardenberg told the assembly .
a security council with three speeds sardenberg said that a more balanced membership of the council was needed to reflect " new realities " and to be responsive to the views and needs of all member states , in particular developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany want permanent membership in the un security council the g-4 believe new permanent seats would allow them to pit themselves against the five veto powers even without their own veto right .
speaking on behalf of the african group at the un , algeria 's ambassador abdallah baali said this was nonsense .
" that would mean a security council with three speeds : with veto power , permanent members and non-permanent , " said baali .
africa would not accept this for its members .
he said there should either be veto power for all permanent members or not at all .
the draft does not spell out which countries would secure the new council seats .
but diplomats said the six new permanent seats would go to the g-4 and two african countries yet to be selected .
g-4 are masquerading as champions of the weak other opponents of the resolution said the g-4 's bid was nothing but a power play and would divert from other reforms .
" the seekers of special privileges and power are masquerading as the champions of the weak and disadvantaged , asserting that the special privileges they seek would make the council more representative , " pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram said .
" we will not choose to anoint six states with special privileges and stamp ourselves as second class members in this organization , " said akram .
he added that the g-4 proposal would leave six winners but 180 losers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary general kofi annan has called on the un 's 190 member nations to help redraw priorities " it will enlarge the ' club of the privileged ' who will have a vested interest in addressing most issues in the security council , further draining the oxygen out of the general assembly , and enhancing the domination of the security council , " he said .
argentina , a leading member of the so-called " united for consensus " group , along with italy , pakistan and mexico , also criticized the g-4 draft for creating " discrimination and artificial hegemonies throughout the regions , which will be detrimental for the work of the security council , " said argentina 's un envoy cesar mayoral .
skeptical us to address un on tuesday at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful un body , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power .
the proposed expansion of the security council is part of a broader plan to overhaul the united nations , which world leaders will discuss at a summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly .
the assembly debate is set to resume tuesday afternoon with an address by the united states .
it has voiced skepticism about the g-4 plan , fearing that enlarging the council beyond 20 members would hurt the body 's effectiveness .
washington favors adding only two new permanent seats with no veto power , including one for japan .
the g-4 countries are pressing for an early vote on the draft , which is co-sponsored by 23 countries including france , possibly as early as late this week . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .

germany 's long road to multiculturalism economy set to dominate german election unemployment europe -pipe- 12.07.2005 the world according to merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : promising " closer consultation " with the us - whatever that means what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?
most likely more of the same , say analysts . it came as no surprise that most of the 38-page party platform the cdu / csu election platform presented the german people on monday was dedicated to solving germany 's unemployment and economic problems . but towards the end , pages 35 to 38 , the conservative parties gave an idea of what sort of germany the world would see were angel merkel to beat gerhard schröder in early elections likely to be held this coming september .
the result ?
aside from a changed profile in the european union and some vague promises of closer cooperation with the united states , not much . germany 's transformation " ms. merkel , like many opposition politicians , does n't have much to say yet on the international stage , " said andreas maurer , a political analyst at the german center for international and security studies .
" that is only something you can develop once you are in the government . " nowhere was that more clear than in the transformation of schröder .
an unknown state governor with a skeptical attitude towards the eu when he became chancellor in 1998 , schröder 's foreign policy was defined by a new self-confidence , evident in germany 's rejection of the us-led invasion of iraq and its increasingly influential role in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frequent flier schröder has given german foreign policy a new self-confidence " no one could imagine when he was elected that he would be a foreign policy chancellor , " said karen donfried , senior director of the german marshall fund in washington d.c.
" and no one in the cdu would want to shift -lrb- this self-confidence -rrb- back . " drifting from the franco-german axis the theory appears to be backed up by the election platform .
the union parties seem to want germany to retain an influential and decision-guiding role in the eu .
but in calling for a reassessment of generous agricultural subsidies in the eu budget , merkel is drifting more towards great britain than france , schröder 's great ally in recent years .
perhaps as an indicator of changing times ahead in the franco-german relationship , the election platform mentions that it wants to " restructure it in a way that includes the trust of other eu partners and their interests . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac wo n't get many of these opportunities with merkel further , eu expansion to include not only turkey , but also bulgaria and romania , is another area in which merkel will differ from schröder , preferring to slam the brakes instead of pushing forward .
analysts are predicting that the proposed start of negotiations with turkey in october - already a divisive point to france , sweden and the netherlands - will became a big campaign issue .
" she will tread this line of promoting a pro-european attitude while at the same time guarding against a larger , expanding union , " said ingo peters , a professor of political science at berlin 's freie university . a change in style , not substance the stance could provide problems for merkel 's promise for " closer consultations " with washington when deciding on international issues .
president george w. bush is a big proponent of turkey 's membership in the eu .
merkel and the union parties are promising nothing more than a " privileged partnership . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel in istanbul last year .
she angered the turkish government with her proposal to grant turkey a " privileged partnership " but not full membership in the eu .
" the americans must also be skeptical what awaits them , " maurer said .
" working closer together sounds nice , but it 's something anyone can say .
what will the christian democratic government say when the united states says , ' the negotiations with turkey should go forth ' ? " but washington can be assured that in areas such as the recent french-german proposal to lift a weapons embargo on china , a merkel government promises to side with the united states in their demands the embargo stay in place .
and if not much else promises to change in substance , the style definitely will . " merkel 's foreign policy will be , if one can wish for this , a lot more quiet , " said peters . interrelating problems so will german initiatives abroad .
no one expects a merkel government to send german soldiers into iraq , and the election platform released monday also notes that germany 's promise to increase its international aid to 0.7 percent of its budget will be dependent on its economic recovery . " the possibility of leading a more active foreign policy is somewhat limited ... because of finances , " said peters . something the union , which devoted 34 pages of its election platform to the economy on monday , seems acutely aware of . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives unveil election platform the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- " kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- turkey worried about german elections germans are not the only ones whose fates lay in the balance of early federal elections .
with the conservatives in power in berlin , turkey would lose a staunch supporter of its bid to join the eu .

marie stopes international studied 100 women 's reasons for having terminations between weeks 19 and 22 of pregnancy .
there have been calls to cut the legal limit from 24 weeks , but marie stopes said this would increase the hardship and distress for women .
in 2003 , 1.6 % -lrb- 2,927 -rrb- of abortions in england and wales were carried out after 20 weeks .
women are n't being irresponsible british pregnancy advisory service spokeswoman ' i 'm too old to have a child ' just under 90 % were carried out in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy .
the british medical association voted recently not to back calls to reduce the current time limit for terminations .

many did not recognise the symptoms of pregnancy ; either continuing to have periods or putting weight gain down to eating too much .
others were taking contraception , such as the mini-pill , which meant their lack of periods was not unusual .
this report is a futile swim against the tide of opinion polls and research in favour of a lowering of the abortion limit life spokesman some were aware of their pregnancy at an early stage , but were either in denial or subsequently experienced a change in circumstances , such as their partner becoming violent .

liz davies , marie stopes international 's director of uk operations , said : " in recent months it seems that everyone - from politicians and medical professionals to journalists and anti abortion advocates - has been allowed to speak out on the issue of late abortion , except for those for whom it is most important ; the women who have experienced it .
" we feel that this study goes some way to redressing that oversight .
' great disservice ' " what emerges very clearly from this research is that no woman who opted for late abortion made the decision lightly .

the platform sits in deep water about 150 miles south of new orleans and was evacuated on friday ahead of the storm .
bp said the cause of the problem is unknown , and there has been no leakage of fuel or other hazardous substances .
thunder horse was set to start pumping oil later this year , and peak output was expected at 250,000 barrels a day .
depression bp said it was not clear if the current problem would put back the planned start date .
" i do n't think we know enough yet to say how this would affect the start of the field , " said bp spokesman ronnie chappell .
mr chappell said that platform may be listing because of excess water in its ballast tanks and there may be little or no structural damage .
hurricane dennis has ripped across cuba and haiti , killing at least 27 people , before coming ashore in the us .
at least four people are reported to have died in the us , where florida , mississippi and alabama have been declared disaster zones .
about 1.4 million people were evacuated ahead of its arrival in the us .
the storm has since lost some of its power and has been downgraded to a tropical depression .
the gulf of mexico provides 30 % of us oil output , and there had been concerns that any disruption to supply would push the price of crude to record levels .

rachel , a 42-year-old married woman , told the charity what led to her to decide to have a termination when she found out she was pregnant at 22 weeks .
she had been on the progesterone only mini-pill , so was not having periods .
rachel , not her real name , said the first thing she noticed , three months earlier , was that she had tender breasts and had a cold .
i 've never wanted to have children and have never had any maternal feelings at all rachel " i went to my doctor and told him , but he just said they were n't related and that i had sinusitis , which he gave me some medicine for , " she said .
six weeks later she returned , but was told by a different doctor that the type of pill she was on , and the fact she had put on some weight could be making her breasts more tender .
a diet did not work , and rachel became increasingly worried as her belly hardened .
but she still did not suspect she might be pregnant .
' no support ' " i went to my doctor again and this time she felt my belly and said i was pregnant .
" i completely panicked .

" i 'm really too old to start to bring up a child .
" i know my husband would n't have left me if we had to have it , but i know it would be the end of our marriage .
rachel added : " my doctor was n't supportive at all .
" she told me i 'd find it really difficult to get a termination as i was so far gone .
" it was the secretary at the doctor 's surgery who got me the appointment at the centre for that afternoon . "
she added : " i think it 's really important that the legal limit should n't be lowered .
" i did n't find out until i was 22 weeks , through no fault of my own .
" i 'm sure nobody takes the decision lightly - and there are so many individual circumstances .

rachel , a 42-year-old married woman , told the charity what led to her to decide to have a termination when she found out she was pregnant at 22 weeks .
she had been on the progesterone only mini-pill , so was not having periods .
rachel , not her real name , said the first thing she noticed , three months earlier , was that she had tender breasts and had a cold .
i 've never wanted to have children and have never had any maternal feelings at all rachel " i went to my doctor and told him , but he just said they were n't related and that i had sinusitis , which he gave me some medicine for , " she said .
six weeks later she returned , but was told by a different doctor that the type of pill she was on , and the fact she had put on some weight could be making her breasts more tender .
a diet did not work , and rachel became increasingly worried as her belly hardened .
but she still did not suspect she might be pregnant .
' no support ' " i went to my doctor again and this time she felt my belly and said i was pregnant .
" i completely panicked .
i 've never wanted to have children and have never had any maternal feelings at all .
" my partner is the same .
we discussed it the day i found out and agreed that termination was the only option .
" we worked out that he would be 65 and i would be 58 by the time the child left school .
" i 'm really too old to start to bring up a child .
" i know my husband would n't have left me if we had to have it , but i know it would be the end of our marriage .
rachel added : " my doctor was n't supportive at all .
" she told me i 'd find it really difficult to get a termination as i was so far gone .
" it was the secretary at the doctor 's surgery who got me the appointment at the centre for that afternoon . "
she added : " i think it 's really important that the legal limit should n't be lowered .
" i did n't find out until i was 22 weeks , through no fault of my own .
" i 'm sure nobody takes the decision lightly - and there are so many individual circumstances .
" everyone 's got a good reason and no one should condemn them for making their own choice .
" i would never try to advise a woman who was in my situation ; it must be her decision . "

the firm nearly collapsed as the chip industry faced meltdown in 2000-2001 , but was rescued by its creditors .
the process of rescheduling the debts of 4.9 trillion won -lrb- $ 4.7bn ; £ 2.7bn -rrb- was originally meant to take until the end of 2006 .
the firm is now 81 % owned by creditors , who are preparing to sell a third of their stake for about $ 2bn -lrb- £ 1.1bn -rrb- .
the news of the stake sale plans sent the firm 's shares down more than 4 % .
the restructuring has seen hynix dispose of almost all its non-core assets , leaving it tightly focused on the production of flash and dynamic ram memory chips .
despite severe fluctuations in demand since the chip glut of 2000-2001 saw the whole industry hit the buffers , demand is expected to be strong during the rest of 2005 .
such expectations have helped hynix pay off its creditors earlier than expected by landing new loans and improving its credit rating , analysts said .
the firm has also settled long-running legal action in recent months .
april saw it agree to plead guilty to price fixing in the us , in conspiracy with several other companies , in exchange for a $ 185m fine .

this week environmental activists are making entreaties to have the sagarmatha national park in the himalayas put on the world heritage danger list , because of the threat to it posed by global warming .
but there is a more mundane issue to be addressed by those who care for this region - the increasing number of visitors and the rubbish they leave behind .
the once pristine snowscape became strewn with human waste , and earned an unflattering reputation for being the " world 's highest garbage site " .
sir chris bonington , who led the first ascent of everest 's south-west face in 1975 , says : " we must deal with this situation .
the area is one of stunning natural beauty , which is in danger of being ruined by litter . "
sir edmund hillary has openly admitted leaving used equipment on the slopes of everest during his pioneering climb in 1953 , when conservation was not so high on the agenda .
the issue has become much more pressing .
hundreds of people make an attempt at the world 's highest peak each year , leaving oxygen tanks , food packaging and tents in their wake - excess weight discarded on the descent .
bad for business recent clear-up efforts have had a real effect , says angchering sherpa , president of the nepal mountaineering association .
the nepalese government now makes expeditions pay a deposit , which is only returnable if they bring their rubbish back down .
2,249 people have reached the summit , " and counting " clean-up climbs , and financial incentives for porters to fill empty bags with mountain litter have worked , he says .
" things are improving , the area is getting cleaner , people are much more cautious about their garbage , " he says .
those who depend on the himalayas for a living realise " if we keep the area clean , it means more business for tour operators , local people and porters " .
the nepalese authorities are now pushing climbers to use metal containers , which can be brought down in crushed form and then recycled , rather than plastic or glass .
the collected material is fuelling local industry in kathmandu and jiri , where it is turned into cooking pans and utensils and sold in nearby markets .
nepalese tourism official summit baral says it is not so much climbers who need to be convinced to obey the ban on plastic and glass , but the huge numbers of tourists who come to the himalayas every year .
can you buy the summit ?
well , we lose five to 10 people each year ...
george martin everestnews.com in 2004 there were some 379,000 .
they " are a bigger worry " , mr baral says .
sir edmund hillary is among those to decry the huge numbers of visitors , including inexperienced amateurs , who take advantage of improved safety and transport links to reach base camp , or even to set foot on the roof of the world .
while it took 30 years for the first 150 climbers to surmount everest , the same number completed the expedition over a three-day period in 2001 .
the number of successful summiteers now stands at 2,249 , " and counting " , says everestnews.com.
a few weeks ago , 45 people reached the top in the same day , including a couple who got married there .
recycled metal is fuelling markets in nepal earlier this year , a helicopter pilot said he had landed on the summit .
that stunt angered some who say they want to preserve the aura of everest , or mount sagarmatha as it is known locally .
the nepalese local organisation dharmapath youth club called the helicopter stunt a " heinous crime against nepal and nepalese sentiments and the norms and values of mountaineering spirit " .
as the highest point on earth becomes less remote , it will inevitably be difficult to balance tourism and conservation , but not everyone believes huge numbers of visitors will be detrimental .
" unquestionably nepal wants the money and locals want the money - they want people to come , " says george martin of everestnews.com.
and he does not agree that everest is now within the reach of everyone .
" sure , anyone can go to everest , " he says .

this week environmental activists are making entreaties to have the sagarmatha national park in the himalayas put on the world heritage danger list , because of the threat to it posed by global warming .
but there is a more mundane issue to be addressed by those who care for this region - the increasing number of visitors and the rubbish they leave behind .
the once pristine snowscape became strewn with human waste , and earned an unflattering reputation for being the " world 's highest garbage site " .
sir chris bonington , who led the first ascent of everest 's south-west face in 1975 , says : " we must deal with this situation .
the area is one of stunning natural beauty , which is in danger of being ruined by litter . "
sir edmund hillary has openly admitted leaving used equipment on the slopes of everest during his pioneering climb in 1953 , when conservation was not so high on the agenda .
the issue has become much more pressing .
hundreds of people make an attempt at the world 's highest peak each year , leaving oxygen tanks , food packaging and tents in their wake - excess weight discarded on the descent .
bad for business recent clear-up efforts have had a real effect , says angchering sherpa , president of the nepal mountaineering association .
the nepalese government now makes expeditions pay a deposit , which is only returnable if they bring their rubbish back down .
2,249 people have reached the summit , " and counting " clean-up climbs , and financial incentives for porters to fill empty bags with mountain litter have worked , he says .
" things are improving , the area is getting cleaner , people are much more cautious about their garbage , " he says .
those who depend on the himalayas for a living realise " if we keep the area clean , it means more business for tour operators , local people and porters " .
the nepalese authorities are now pushing climbers to use metal containers , which can be brought down in crushed form and then recycled , rather than plastic or glass .
the collected material is fuelling local industry in kathmandu and jiri , where it is turned into cooking pans and utensils and sold in nearby markets .
nepalese tourism official summit baral says it is not so much climbers who need to be convinced to obey the ban on plastic and glass , but the huge numbers of tourists who come to the himalayas every year .
can you buy the summit ?
well , we lose five to 10 people each year ...
george martin everestnews.com in 2004 there were some 379,000 .
they " are a bigger worry " , mr baral says .
sir edmund hillary is among those to decry the huge numbers of visitors , including inexperienced amateurs , who take advantage of improved safety and transport links to reach base camp , or even to set foot on the roof of the world .
while it took 30 years for the first 150 climbers to surmount everest , the same number completed the expedition over a three-day period in 2001 .
the number of successful summiteers now stands at 2,249 , " and counting " , says everestnews.com.
a few weeks ago , 45 people reached the top in the same day , including a couple who got married there .
recycled metal is fuelling markets in nepal earlier this year , a helicopter pilot said he had landed on the summit .
that stunt angered some who say they want to preserve the aura of everest , or mount sagarmatha as it is known locally .
the nepalese local organisation dharmapath youth club called the helicopter stunt a " heinous crime against nepal and nepalese sentiments and the norms and values of mountaineering spirit " .
as the highest point on earth becomes less remote , it will inevitably be difficult to balance tourism and conservation , but not everyone believes huge numbers of visitors will be detrimental .
" unquestionably nepal wants the money and locals want the money - they want people to come , " says george martin of everestnews.com.
and he does not agree that everest is now within the reach of everyone .
" sure , anyone can go to everest , " he says .
" but can you buy the summit ?
well , we lose five to 10 people each year , so it 's still a huge test of endurance . "

the admission is made in tuesday 's bbc wales week in week out programme , which investigates the growing problem of traffic and pollution in wales .
researchers found that traffic volume in wales had reached a level not expected for another decade .
commuter traffic into cardiff grows 3 % a year , 50 % above the british average .
it also found that while the problem was most acute in the capital - where 110,000 people commute every morning - other areas of wales were approaching capacity .
clive jones , of the union unison , said more needed to be done to make public transport more attractive to commuters .
" we need to spend far more on public transport to make it a viable alternative , " he said .
congestion charges are being considered as an option in cardiff with transport powers now being transferred to the welsh assembly government , professor stuart cole of the university of glamorgan has called for a radical , more european rethink of policy .
" we must invest now .
we have really now got to rethink what we are doing in terms of how we will move people around , " he said .
" we ca n't keep spending money on roads .
we have to look at other forms of persuading people to transfer from their cars , then we wo n't need to build roads . "
week in week out reported that the assembly government was planning to spend nearly half its £ 8bn budget on roads - as well as £ 380m of private funding for the m4 relief road .
pollution environmental campaigners wwf said they were dismayed .
" climate change is a reality and traffic is the fastest growing contributor to co2 emissions " , said welsh director morgan parry .
" there 's going to have to be a fundamental change in the way that we think about the way we move around , and also the way government thinks about this . "
earlier this year , the uk government said it was considering introducing a ' pay-as-you-drive ' road charging scheme .
cardiff council has confirmed that there will probably be a congestion charge similar to london 's , in an attempt to keep traffic levels down and and pay for better public transport .
the city is running out of space. the council has said , and doing nothing is not an option .
former council leader russell goodway believes road charging in cardiff is now essential .
" we need nothing short of a transportation revolution in which we change the entire culture of people 's travelling habits , " he said .
week in week out - the road to nowhere , will be broadcast on bbc1 wales on tuesday at 2235 bst and repeated on wednesday at 2100bst on bbc 2w .

the admission is made in tuesday 's bbc wales week in week out programme , which investigates the growing problem of traffic and pollution in wales .
researchers found that traffic volume in wales had reached a level not expected for another decade .
commuter traffic into cardiff grows 3 % a year , 50 % above the british average .
it also found that while the problem was most acute in the capital - where 110,000 people commute every morning - other areas of wales were approaching capacity .
clive jones , of the union unison , said more needed to be done to make public transport more attractive to commuters .
" we need to spend far more on public transport to make it a viable alternative , " he said .
congestion charges are being considered as an option in cardiff with transport powers now being transferred to the welsh assembly government , professor stuart cole of the university of glamorgan has called for a radical , more european rethink of policy .
" we must invest now .
we have really now got to rethink what we are doing in terms of how we will move people around , " he said .
" we ca n't keep spending money on roads .
we have to look at other forms of persuading people to transfer from their cars , then we wo n't need to build roads . "

one day the nottingham schoolgirl can be holed up at the dockside of war-torn monrovia , liberia , another she can be touring europe or south africa .
maths classes can be carried out at the local bazaar , languages learned from native speakers and history lessons often take place in the actual location .
kathryn and the rest of the newcombe family have been spending a year living on the " mercy ship " anastasis , where her father , steve , has been working as a maths and history teacher .
learning curve the ships , which are operated by a christian charity , dock for up to half a year at a time in countries like benin , togo , sierra leone and the gambia , opening their doors to the sick .
staff book a local football pitch and on the first day there can be as many as 5,000 people waiting to be assessed and or trying to get operation dates .
mr newcombe said the whole african experience had been a tremendous learning curve for his family .
" you need to see it with your own eyes .
we have been to visit orphanages and my children played football with the children there . "
i think if you are a very creative person there are lots of opportunities " brian blackburn , head teacher " there is a civil war here in monrovia , and the children realised that when they saw the armed guards and the un troops . "
but he said the opportunities for kathryn and her brothers had been tremendous and that he was glad they had taken the gap-year .
" they have had a great time on the ship and have made some good friends .
" they are learning a lot of languages from hearing things spoken here .
they have learned a bit of french , some dutch and german .
i always hated languages at school , but already they are picking up little bits . "
but because the ship teaches an american syllabus , mr newcombe would advise english parents to consider going there only until their children were secondary school age .
" i am concerned that if they did carry on here beyond that our children would fall behind , although as their teacher i could ensure that they did n't . "
kathryn , 10 , said she was looking forward to telling her friends about all her experiences .
missing home " when i get home i am going to tell them about the animals and the ants and the butterflies , which are really huge , and the lizards which we have found in our cabin .
" i really liked going to holland , which had a big park and was really nice , and people could speak english as well . "
but she was missing her old friends and could not wait to go home and see them .
the anastasis can take up to 50 children aged between one and 17 .
there is one teacher to every 10 pupils .
american head teacher brian blackburn has been on-board for a decade , but still loves the variety of ship life .
" in europe the kids usually go out and see a lot on field trips .
we went to see anne frank 's house .
" when we go to south africa we will take the children up table mountain .
in africa we will have a maths class at the market where we will barter .
" i think if you are a very creative person there are lots of opportunities .
" two to three months out of a year the ship does a pr tour and shows what mercy ships do in each port .
" last summer was spent in the faroe islands seeing puffins and going hiking .
" the children were able to see a part of the world they could not normally see .
i have been spoilt just doing a normal job . "
mr blackburn said the children and their teachers were considered to be part of his family , but some might find the situation claustrophobic .
positives and negatives " with the children being on-board and living on the ship we really do see a lot of them .
" at home i taught for a year and it would be a rare thing if i encountered them outside .
that could be a positive thing and that could be a negative thing . "
the children tended to form intense bonds quickly , treating each other more like siblings than friends .
" when we have children leave the ship , the other children get very upset when they have to have a farewell .
some of them are in tears .
they build relationships on the ship very quickly . "
another british parent is transportation manager olly peet , from hertford , whose wife sally and children anna , three , and noah , five , are also on-board .
he said : " noah is in a classroom with one teacher and one other child .
he is far ahead of where he would be in the uk .
" anna has another little girl and one teacher and she is already learning the alphabet .
" we were in a bit of a rat race in hertfordshire and i was conscious that most of the world does not enjoy what we do .
there is so much need and desperation .
i think this is where we were meant to be . "
mrs peet agreed , saying : " noah loves being in a small group and will find the transition hard when we get home , when he has to share a teacher .
" in his class he has learned lots of interesting things , such as how things in the ship work .
" he has been to the pathology laboratories and grown cultures and has seen how the engine room works .
" he has had an amazing experience and loves school , which is a good job , as they do n't get a huge amount of holidays . "

maths classes can be carried out at the local bazaar , languages learned from native speakers and history lessons often take place in the actual location .
kathryn and the rest of the newcombe family have been spending a year living on the " mercy ship " anastasis , where her father , steve , has been working as a maths and history teacher .
