the project focuses on the rules software can place upon those using it .
" it 's great to be part of the transmediale , " said utterback .

he used subtly changing images from a surveillance camera in northern finland to increase viewers ' perceptions of an intense soundtrack .
5voltcore , consisting of emanuel andel and christian gützer , built a computer that short-circuits itself via a robotic arm to create changing digital images .

the focus is meant to highlight artwork that deals with the often contradictory nature of modern technology and society .
" this time we consciously wanted to focus of the foundations of the artistic process and reflect upon the basic ethical principles of our society today , " said broeckmann .
" but we 're not talking about ' back to basics ' , we want to develop ' next level basics ' to update our moral and cultural foundations for today . "
broeckmann said the interdisciplinary nature of media art was especially well suited to look at society 's still evolving attitudes to the controversial fields of biotechnology and security technology , as well as the relentless nature of our modern consumer-oriented world .
" the festival , of course , wo n't come up with ultimate answers to these issues , but we hope to contribute to a fresh , forward-looking debate about the foundations of culture , " he said .

2005 " having categories in the past frustrated the jury , " festival director andreas broeckmann said . " now they can focus just on the quality of the entries and this year they decided three were worthy winners . "
american artist camille utterback won for her submission " untitled 5 " , which used sophisticated software that enables audience members to become interactive participants in a multimedia painting .
the project focuses on the rules software can place upon those using it .
" it 's great to be part of the transmediale , " said utterback .
" the people in the audience are really thinking about the issues behind the art . "
the other two winning entries were " suburbs of the void " , a video work by german artist thomas köner , and " shockbot corejulio " , a computer installation from austrian outfit 5voltcore .
köner 's submission looked at the passage of time through the perception of image and sound .
he used subtly changing images from a surveillance camera in northern finland to increase viewers ' perceptions of an intense soundtrack .
5voltcore , consisting of emanuel andel and christian gützer , built a computer that short-circuits itself via a robotic arm to create changing digital images .
" you ca n't control it , the pictures emerge from errors , " andel said . showing how the robotic arm operated on the exposed circuit board , he said the computer would eventually cause itself to crash - effectively committing suicide .
technology 's impact bildunterschrift : how to fix the world - jacqueline goss , usa , transmediale 2005 media art can be notoriously amorphous , which is perhaps why the organizers picked " basics " as this year 's festival theme .
the focus is meant to highlight artwork that deals with the often contradictory nature of modern technology and society .
" this time we consciously wanted to focus of the foundations of the artistic process and reflect upon the basic ethical principles of our society today , " said broeckmann .
" but we 're not talking about ' back to basics ' , we want to develop ' next level basics ' to update our moral and cultural foundations for today . "
broeckmann said the interdisciplinary nature of media art was especially well suited to look at society 's still evolving attitudes to the controversial fields of biotechnology and security technology , as well as the relentless nature of our modern consumer-oriented world .
" the festival , of course , wo n't come up with ultimate answers to these issues , but we hope to contribute to a fresh , forward-looking debate about the foundations of culture , " he said .

american artist camille utterback won for her submission " untitled 5 " , which used sophisticated software that enables audience members to become interactive participants in a multimedia painting .
the project focuses on the rules software can place upon those using it .
" it 's great to be part of the transmediale , " said utterback .

the other two winning entries were " suburbs of the void " , a video work by german artist thomas köner , and " shockbot corejulio " , a computer installation from austrian outfit 5voltcore .
köner 's submission looked at the passage of time through the perception of image and sound .
he used subtly changing images from a surveillance camera in northern finland to increase viewers ' perceptions of an intense soundtrack .
5voltcore , consisting of emanuel andel and christian gützer , built a computer that short-circuits itself via a robotic arm to create changing digital images .

" but we 're not talking about ' back to basics ' , we want to develop ' next level basics ' to update our moral and cultural foundations for today . "
broeckmann said the interdisciplinary nature of media art was especially well suited to look at society 's still evolving attitudes to the controversial fields of biotechnology and security technology , as well as the relentless nature of our modern consumer-oriented world .
" the festival , of course , wo n't come up with ultimate answers to these issues , but we hope to contribute to a fresh , forward-looking debate about the foundations of culture , " he said .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .
jesus on a surfing trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surfing jesus the book is controversial because of its out-of-the-ordinary depictions of jesus , such as one of his crossing the sea of galilee naked on a surfboard , receiving divine inspiration from frankincense .
one illustration recasts the last supper as a drinking binge .
characters such as fashion designer karl lagerfeld and the late guitar wonder jimi hendrix mingle with jesus in the tales .
the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .
in some countries , it has sparked protests and a czech lawmaker wanted the author fined .
but in no other country has the book been banned .
" after all , greece is a member of the european union and , so you would think , not a religious state in which an artist 's freedom of expression is kicked to the ground , " said harderer 's publisher , fritz panzer .
blasphemy laws hinder artistic freedom the crackdown on the book was condemned by the geneva-based international publishers ' association -lrb- ipa -rrb- because of concerns that the ruling will hinder other authors .
bildunterschrift : gerhard haderer poses in front of one of his comics " while ipa opposes all forms of religious intolerance , it stands for the elimination of all prohibitions limiting freedom of expression whether imposed by governments or by religious authorities , " ipa officials wrote in a statement . vivian papanayotou -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .

" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .
" but if these steps do n't lead to success , then a ban should n't be ruled out . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes for anti-smoking initiatives the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .

the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .
jesus on a surfing trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surfing jesus the book is controversial because of its out-of-the-ordinary depictions of jesus , such as one of his crossing the sea of galilee naked on a surfboard , receiving divine inspiration from frankincense .
one illustration recasts the last supper as a drinking binge .
characters such as fashion designer karl lagerfeld and the late guitar wonder jimi hendrix mingle with jesus in the tales .
the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .
in some countries , it has sparked protests and a czech lawmaker wanted the author fined .
but in no other country has the book been banned .
" after all , greece is a member of the european union and , so you would think , not a religious state in which an artist 's freedom of expression is kicked to the ground , " said harderer 's publisher , fritz panzer .
blasphemy laws hinder artistic freedom the crackdown on the book was condemned by the geneva-based international publishers ' association -lrb- ipa -rrb- because of concerns that the ruling will hinder other authors .
bildunterschrift : gerhard haderer poses in front of one of his comics " while ipa opposes all forms of religious intolerance , it stands for the elimination of all prohibitions limiting freedom of expression whether imposed by governments or by religious authorities , " ipa officials wrote in a statement . vivian papanayotou -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .

the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .

2005 " having categories in the past frustrated the jury , " festival director andreas broeckmann said . " now they can focus just on the quality of the entries and this year they decided three were worthy winners . "
american artist camille utterback won for her submission " untitled 5 " , which used sophisticated software that enables audience members to become interactive participants in a multimedia painting .
the project focuses on the rules software can place upon those using it .
" it 's great to be part of the transmediale , " said utterback .
" the people in the audience are really thinking about the issues behind the art . "
the other two winning entries were " suburbs of the void " , a video work by german artist thomas köner , and " shockbot corejulio " , a computer installation from austrian outfit 5voltcore .
köner 's submission looked at the passage of time through the perception of image and sound .
he used subtly changing images from a surveillance camera in northern finland to increase viewers ' perceptions of an intense soundtrack .
5voltcore , consisting of emanuel andel and christian gützer , built a computer that short-circuits itself via a robotic arm to create changing digital images .
" you ca n't control it , the pictures emerge from errors , " andel said . showing how the robotic arm operated on the exposed circuit board , he said the computer would eventually cause itself to crash - effectively committing suicide .
technology 's impact bildunterschrift : how to fix the world - jacqueline goss , usa , transmediale 2005 media art can be notoriously amorphous , which is perhaps why the organizers picked " basics " as this year 's festival theme .
the focus is meant to highlight artwork that deals with the often contradictory nature of modern technology and society .
" this time we consciously wanted to focus of the foundations of the artistic process and reflect upon the basic ethical principles of our society today , " said broeckmann .
" but we 're not talking about ' back to basics ' , we want to develop ' next level basics ' to update our moral and cultural foundations for today . "
broeckmann said the interdisciplinary nature of media art was especially well suited to look at society 's still evolving attitudes to the controversial fields of biotechnology and security technology , as well as the relentless nature of our modern consumer-oriented world .
" the festival , of course , wo n't come up with ultimate answers to these issues , but we hope to contribute to a fresh , forward-looking debate about the foundations of culture , " he said .

the project focuses on the rules software can place upon those using it .
" it 's great to be part of the transmediale , " said utterback .

köner 's submission looked at the passage of time through the perception of image and sound .
he used subtly changing images from a surveillance camera in northern finland to increase viewers ' perceptions of an intense soundtrack .
5voltcore , consisting of emanuel andel and christian gützer , built a computer that short-circuits itself via a robotic arm to create changing digital images .

american artist camille utterback won for her submission " untitled 5 " , which used sophisticated software that enables audience members to become interactive participants in a multimedia painting .
the project focuses on the rules software can place upon those using it .
" it 's great to be part of the transmediale , " said utterback .
" the people in the audience are really thinking about the issues behind the art . "
the other two winning entries were " suburbs of the void " , a video work by german artist thomas köner , and " shockbot corejulio " , a computer installation from austrian outfit 5voltcore .
köner 's submission looked at the passage of time through the perception of image and sound .
he used subtly changing images from a surveillance camera in northern finland to increase viewers ' perceptions of an intense soundtrack .
5voltcore , consisting of emanuel andel and christian gützer , built a computer that short-circuits itself via a robotic arm to create changing digital images .
" you ca n't control it , the pictures emerge from errors , " andel said . showing how the robotic arm operated on the exposed circuit board , he said the computer would eventually cause itself to crash - effectively committing suicide .

the focus is meant to highlight artwork that deals with the often contradictory nature of modern technology and society .
" this time we consciously wanted to focus of the foundations of the artistic process and reflect upon the basic ethical principles of our society today , " said broeckmann .
" but we 're not talking about ' back to basics ' , we want to develop ' next level basics ' to update our moral and cultural foundations for today . "
broeckmann said the interdisciplinary nature of media art was especially well suited to look at society 's still evolving attitudes to the controversial fields of biotechnology and security technology , as well as the relentless nature of our modern consumer-oriented world .
" the festival , of course , wo n't come up with ultimate answers to these issues , but we hope to contribute to a fresh , forward-looking debate about the foundations of culture , " he said .

the project focuses on the rules software can place upon those using it .
" it 's great to be part of the transmediale , " said utterback .
" the people in the audience are really thinking about the issues behind the art . "
the other two winning entries were " suburbs of the void " , a video work by german artist thomas köner , and " shockbot corejulio " , a computer installation from austrian outfit 5voltcore .
köner 's submission looked at the passage of time through the perception of image and sound .
he used subtly changing images from a surveillance camera in northern finland to increase viewers ' perceptions of an intense soundtrack .
5voltcore , consisting of emanuel andel and christian gützer , built a computer that short-circuits itself via a robotic arm to create changing digital images .

" the festival , of course , wo n't come up with ultimate answers to these issues , but we hope to contribute to a fresh , forward-looking debate about the foundations of culture , " he said .

american artist camille utterback won for her submission " untitled 5 " , which used sophisticated software that enables audience members to become interactive participants in a multimedia painting .
the project focuses on the rules software can place upon those using it .
" it 's great to be part of the transmediale , " said utterback .

the other two winning entries were " suburbs of the void " , a video work by german artist thomas köner , and " shockbot corejulio " , a computer installation from austrian outfit 5voltcore .
köner 's submission looked at the passage of time through the perception of image and sound .
he used subtly changing images from a surveillance camera in northern finland to increase viewers ' perceptions of an intense soundtrack .
5voltcore , consisting of emanuel andel and christian gützer , built a computer that short-circuits itself via a robotic arm to create changing digital images .
" you ca n't control it , the pictures emerge from errors , " andel said . showing how the robotic arm operated on the exposed circuit board , he said the computer would eventually cause itself to crash - effectively committing suicide .

the focus is meant to highlight artwork that deals with the often contradictory nature of modern technology and society .
" this time we consciously wanted to focus of the foundations of the artistic process and reflect upon the basic ethical principles of our society today , " said broeckmann .
" but we 're not talking about ' back to basics ' , we want to develop ' next level basics ' to update our moral and cultural foundations for today . "
broeckmann said the interdisciplinary nature of media art was especially well suited to look at society 's still evolving attitudes to the controversial fields of biotechnology and security technology , as well as the relentless nature of our modern consumer-oriented world .
" the festival , of course , wo n't come up with ultimate answers to these issues , but we hope to contribute to a fresh , forward-looking debate about the foundations of culture , " he said .

public participation the festival was officially opened last week with sky ear , a project involving several helium-filled balloons and electromagnetic fields .
tethered together to form a floating cloud 100 meters in the sky , the balloons were equipped with ultra-bright leds that changed color and intensity as they interacted with electromagnetic waves from television broadcasts , police radios and other wireless communication devices .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true .

but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 polish secret police list opens old wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national remembrance institute archive in warsaw unlike germany , poland has n't opened up its communist-era secret file archives to the public .
now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .
" we 're going to witness an ever increasing number of sensational claims that will surface on the internet and in the media , " said szetyna .
" but , we 'll never be sure whether they 've been investigated or whether they 're false .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .
" but if these steps do n't lead to success , then a ban should n't be ruled out .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .
jesus on a surfing trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surfing jesus the book is controversial because of its out-of-the-ordinary depictions of jesus , such as one of his crossing the sea of galilee naked on a surfboard , receiving divine inspiration from frankincense .
one illustration recasts the last supper as a drinking binge .
characters such as fashion designer karl lagerfeld and the late guitar wonder jimi hendrix mingle with jesus in the tales .
the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .
in some countries , it has sparked protests and a czech lawmaker wanted the author fined .
but in no other country has the book been banned .
" after all , greece is a member of the european union and , so you would think , not a religious state in which an artist 's freedom of expression is kicked to the ground , " said harderer 's publisher , fritz panzer .
blasphemy laws hinder artistic freedom the crackdown on the book was condemned by the geneva-based international publishers ' association -lrb- ipa -rrb- because of concerns that the ruling will hinder other authors .
bildunterschrift : gerhard haderer poses in front of one of his comics " while ipa opposes all forms of religious intolerance , it stands for the elimination of all prohibitions limiting freedom of expression whether imposed by governments or by religious authorities , " ipa officials wrote in a statement . vivian papanayotou -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 danes set to re-elect center-right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier anders fogh rasmussen -lrb- left -rrb- plans on celebrating his win as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration . public opinions polls point to a commanding victory for rasmussen 's liberal party and its coalition partner the conservatives , who are informally backed in parliament by the far-right danish people 's party .
the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .
opposition parties have promised to bring the troops home at the end of their mandate in june if elected .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.02.2005 weak dollar unnerves german car giants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : profits on cars made in germany and sold in the us could be slashed german auto manufacturers are facing the prospect of having their us profits from imported models slashed due to the weak performance of the dollar .
for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .
opposition parties have promised to bring the troops home at the end of their mandate in june if elected .
around 2,000 people protested in the danish capital against the war on saturday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de copenhagen museum recalls dramatic rescue of jews tuesday 's opening of a daniel libeskind-designed jewish museum in denmark casts light on one of the few happy chapters in wwii history : the rescue of 7,000 danish jews from nazi persecution .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .

china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .
" we 're going to witness an ever increasing number of sensational claims that will surface on the internet and in the media , " said szetyna .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .
" but if these steps do n't lead to success , then a ban should n't be ruled out .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .
" we 're going to witness an ever increasing number of sensational claims that will surface on the internet and in the media , " said szetyna .
" but , we 'll never be sure whether they 've been investigated or whether they 're false .

the french leader is notably to hold private talks with bush the night the us leader arrives in brussels on february 21 . french guantanamo prisoners released ahead of rice 's arrival in paris from rome , french judicial sources told afp that the united states had agreed to release the remaining three french prisoners being held in its military base in guantanamo , cuba . the us decision to release the three french prisoners from guantanamo was also a move timed to placate france , although it may have also been prompted by a us judge 's ruling last month that military trials of prisoners at the base violated the us constitution . problems remain between france , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paratroopers of u.s. army 173rd airborne brigade guard at the harir airfield , 45 miles northeast of the kurdish city of irbil in northern iraq on friday march 28 , 2003 .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 polish secret police list opens old wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national remembrance institute archive in warsaw unlike germany , poland has n't opened up its communist-era secret file archives to the public .
now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .

the wardrobe change is expected to come into effect next year . what will the snappiest-dressed police officers be wearing this season ?
well , for most of them in europe , it will be the same old boring blue .
the greeks sweat their way through the humid streets of athens in azure , while the french gendarmerie have been advocates of bleu for as long as anyone can remember .
nothing really to get excited about in the law enforcement fashion stakes this or any other year . not unless you 're a police officer in berlin , that is .
the german capital 's cops are due to follow hamburg 's lead it as they get set to swap their mostly green-beige wardrobes for blue , possibly within the next 12 months .
freed from the seventies styling of mustard shirts and brown slacks , berlin 's finest will probably not care a jot that they are fashion followers rather than trend setters . five german states have already decided that that their police forces will be clad in blue , brandenburg is toying with the idea while in hamburg the process of wardrobe-transition has already begun .
in addition , the country 's border patrol force is also gearing up to hang up their green rags by mid-year and slip into a bluer shade . " the trend is irreversible , " berlin senator ehrhart körting told german daily berliner zeitung .
" we do not want to shut ourselves out . " what does a color mean ? but why blue ?
far from being the most sober alternative to the military green of old , many believe blue inspires calm while some say it imparts authority .
others call it a respect thing .
but the reality may be that for as long as there have been cops on tv and in film , they have been decked out in blue uniforms which have become the quintessential police outfit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york police .
most european cops say they look to new york police officers for inspiration : the new york police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- blues are famous , particularly after the arrival of the hit police drama , " nypd blue . " cheaper in the long-run berlin 's finest were n't always green .
until 1973 , they were , in fact , blue .
but the designs were old-fashioned and looked like the former army uniforms .
so they were updated- to a calming green . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american actor peter falk , most famous for his role as detective columbo , wore a police uniform on a german tv show in 2003 .
berlin resisted the trend for sometime , mostly due to the poor state of the city 's finances .
but recently , they found a solution : buying together with other municipalities can save them up to 20 percent .
and the new uniforms , at a cost of € 500 -lrb- $ 639 -rrb- each , will be € 630 cheaper when bought in bulk .
the initiative is expected to cost about € 8.8 million and take about five years .
in the meantime , berlin cops will be green - and blue . the police officers themselves say they welcome the change , particularly with the sleeker , modern cuts and breathable fabric . uniforms vs. radios in hamburg , the trailblazer of the wardrobe changes , the public is catching on , say officials .
still , bavaria resists , for good reasons , interior ministry spokesman michael ziegler told berliner zeitung . " we need our money for more important things than for uniforms in a different color , " he said .
apparently , bavarian officers put more modern communication systems ahead of looking good . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to move federal police to aid terror fight to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .
the whirlwind itinerary was largely to set the scene for a february 21-24 visit by us president bush . important appearance for critical rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris leg was considered the most important for rice , who in 2003 famously said that washington should " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia " for opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq to look for supposed weapons of mass destruction . her speech on tuesday contained less inflammatory language and suggested that washington was now serious about smoothing over the dispute and restoring us-european cooperation to its former strength . rice also spoke warmly of the relationship between france and the united states , saying that the two countries had a shared past and , more importantly , a shared future .
she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .
the french leader is notably to hold private talks with bush the night the us leader arrives in brussels on february 21 . french guantanamo prisoners released ahead of rice 's arrival in paris from rome , french judicial sources told afp that the united states had agreed to release the remaining three french prisoners being held in its military base in guantanamo , cuba . the us decision to release the three french prisoners from guantanamo was also a move timed to placate france , although it may have also been prompted by a us judge 's ruling last month that military trials of prisoners at the base violated the us constitution . problems remain between france , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paratroopers of u.s. army 173rd airborne brigade guard at the harir airfield , 45 miles northeast of the kurdish city of irbil in northern iraq on friday march 28 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / hasan sarbakhshian -rrb- nevertheless , differences remain .
the united states has been unable to convince france to become engaged in post-conflict iraq beyond a promise to train iraqi security forces outside the violence-wracked country . it has also raised french hackles for refusing to sign on to the international criminal court , for refusing to ratify the kyoto accord and for not actively supporting efforts by france , britain and germany to reign in iran 's nuclear program through diplomatic means . another test of us-french ties will come later this week , when us defence secretary donald rumsfeld and his french counterpart , michele alliot-marie , attend an informal nato meeting in the french riviera city of nice to discuss iraq and other issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different diplomat , same strategy in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat .

the wardrobe change is expected to come into effect next year . what will the snappiest-dressed police officers be wearing this season ?
well , for most of them in europe , it will be the same old boring blue .
the greeks sweat their way through the humid streets of athens in azure , while the french gendarmerie have been advocates of bleu for as long as anyone can remember .
nothing really to get excited about in the law enforcement fashion stakes this or any other year . not unless you 're a police officer in berlin , that is .
the german capital 's cops are due to follow hamburg 's lead it as they get set to swap their mostly green-beige wardrobes for blue , possibly within the next 12 months .
freed from the seventies styling of mustard shirts and brown slacks , berlin 's finest will probably not care a jot that they are fashion followers rather than trend setters . five german states have already decided that that their police forces will be clad in blue , brandenburg is toying with the idea while in hamburg the process of wardrobe-transition has already begun .
in addition , the country 's border patrol force is also gearing up to hang up their green rags by mid-year and slip into a bluer shade . " the trend is irreversible , " berlin senator ehrhart körting told german daily berliner zeitung .
" we do not want to shut ourselves out . " what does a color mean ? but why blue ?
far from being the most sober alternative to the military green of old , many believe blue inspires calm while some say it imparts authority .
others call it a respect thing .
but the reality may be that for as long as there have been cops on tv and in film , they have been decked out in blue uniforms which have become the quintessential police outfit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york police .
most european cops say they look to new york police officers for inspiration : the new york police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- blues are famous , particularly after the arrival of the hit police drama , " nypd blue . " cheaper in the long-run berlin 's finest were n't always green .
until 1973 , they were , in fact , blue .
but the designs were old-fashioned and looked like the former army uniforms .
so they were updated- to a calming green . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american actor peter falk , most famous for his role as detective columbo , wore a police uniform on a german tv show in 2003 .
berlin resisted the trend for sometime , mostly due to the poor state of the city 's finances .
but recently , they found a solution : buying together with other municipalities can save them up to 20 percent .
and the new uniforms , at a cost of € 500 -lrb- $ 639 -rrb- each , will be € 630 cheaper when bought in bulk .
the initiative is expected to cost about € 8.8 million and take about five years .
in the meantime , berlin cops will be green - and blue . the police officers themselves say they welcome the change , particularly with the sleeker , modern cuts and breathable fabric . uniforms vs. radios in hamburg , the trailblazer of the wardrobe changes , the public is catching on , say officials .
still , bavaria resists , for good reasons , interior ministry spokesman michael ziegler told berliner zeitung . " we need our money for more important things than for uniforms in a different color , " he said .
apparently , bavarian officers put more modern communication systems ahead of looking good . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to move federal police to aid terror fight to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .
jesus on a surfing trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surfing jesus the book is controversial because of its out-of-the-ordinary depictions of jesus , such as one of his crossing the sea of galilee naked on a surfboard , receiving divine inspiration from frankincense .
one illustration recasts the last supper as a drinking binge .
characters such as fashion designer karl lagerfeld and the late guitar wonder jimi hendrix mingle with jesus in the tales .
the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .
in some countries , it has sparked protests and a czech lawmaker wanted the author fined .
but in no other country has the book been banned .
" after all , greece is a member of the european union and , so you would think , not a religious state in which an artist 's freedom of expression is kicked to the ground , " said harderer 's publisher , fritz panzer .
blasphemy laws hinder artistic freedom the crackdown on the book was condemned by the geneva-based international publishers ' association -lrb- ipa -rrb- because of concerns that the ruling will hinder other authors .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .
bmw , however , has no plans to expand production of its x5 suv and z4 sports car at its assembly plant in spartanburg , south carolina . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers pin us hopes on new models as the north american international auto show gets underway in detroit this week , german carmakers are hoping new models will increase their market share in america despite the strong euro .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .

the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .

the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .
opposition parties have promised to bring the troops home at the end of their mandate in june if elected .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .

at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good .

a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .

" the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 polish secret police list opens old wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national remembrance institute archive in warsaw unlike germany , poland has n't opened up its communist-era secret file archives to the public .
now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .
" we 're going to witness an ever increasing number of sensational claims that will surface on the internet and in the media , " said szetyna .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .
the whirlwind itinerary was largely to set the scene for a february 21-24 visit by us president bush . important appearance for critical rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris leg was considered the most important for rice , who in 2003 famously said that washington should " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia " for opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq to look for supposed weapons of mass destruction . her speech on tuesday contained less inflammatory language and suggested that washington was now serious about smoothing over the dispute and restoring us-european cooperation to its former strength . rice also spoke warmly of the relationship between france and the united states , saying that the two countries had a shared past and , more importantly , a shared future .
she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .
the french leader is notably to hold private talks with bush the night the us leader arrives in brussels on february 21 . french guantanamo prisoners released ahead of rice 's arrival in paris from rome , french judicial sources told afp that the united states had agreed to release the remaining three french prisoners being held in its military base in guantanamo , cuba . the us decision to release the three french prisoners from guantanamo was also a move timed to placate france , although it may have also been prompted by a us judge 's ruling last month that military trials of prisoners at the base violated the us constitution . problems remain between france , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paratroopers of u.s. army 173rd airborne brigade guard at the harir airfield , 45 miles northeast of the kurdish city of irbil in northern iraq on friday march 28 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / hasan sarbakhshian -rrb- nevertheless , differences remain .
the united states has been unable to convince france to become engaged in post-conflict iraq beyond a promise to train iraqi security forces outside the violence-wracked country . it has also raised french hackles for refusing to sign on to the international criminal court , for refusing to ratify the kyoto accord and for not actively supporting efforts by france , britain and germany to reign in iran 's nuclear program through diplomatic means . another test of us-french ties will come later this week , when us defence secretary donald rumsfeld and his french counterpart , michele alliot-marie , attend an informal nato meeting in the french riviera city of nice to discuss iraq and other issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different diplomat , same strategy in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .

it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "

she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .
the french leader is notably to hold private talks with bush the night the us leader arrives in brussels on february 21 . french guantanamo prisoners released ahead of rice 's arrival in paris from rome , french judicial sources told afp that the united states had agreed to release the remaining three french prisoners being held in its military base in guantanamo , cuba . the us decision to release the three french prisoners from guantanamo was also a move timed to placate france , although it may have also been prompted by a us judge 's ruling last month that military trials of prisoners at the base violated the us constitution . problems remain between france , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paratroopers of u.s. army 173rd airborne brigade guard at the harir airfield , 45 miles northeast of the kurdish city of irbil in northern iraq on friday march 28 , 2003 .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.02.2005 rice calls for " new chapter " in transatlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new us secretary of state has adopted a conciliatory tone condoleezza rice used a speech in paris on tuesday to begin mending bridges with the french government and to urge europe to " stand ready " to work with the us . the new us secretary of state arrived in paris on tuesday and urged europe to " stand ready to work with america " in a speech seen as the key moment of an eight-nation tour which was to include talks with french president jacques chirac . rice 's choice of the french capital for her address was carefully chosen .
chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .
the whirlwind itinerary was largely to set the scene for a february 21-24 visit by us president bush . important appearance for critical rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris leg was considered the most important for rice , who in 2003 famously said that washington should " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia " for opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq to look for supposed weapons of mass destruction . her speech on tuesday contained less inflammatory language and suggested that washington was now serious about smoothing over the dispute and restoring us-european cooperation to its former strength . rice also spoke warmly of the relationship between france and the united states , saying that the two countries had a shared past and , more importantly , a shared future .
she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .
jesus on a surfing trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surfing jesus the book is controversial because of its out-of-the-ordinary depictions of jesus , such as one of his crossing the sea of galilee naked on a surfboard , receiving divine inspiration from frankincense .
one illustration recasts the last supper as a drinking binge .
characters such as fashion designer karl lagerfeld and the late guitar wonder jimi hendrix mingle with jesus in the tales .
the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .
in some countries , it has sparked protests and a czech lawmaker wanted the author fined .
but in no other country has the book been banned .
" after all , greece is a member of the european union and , so you would think , not a religious state in which an artist 's freedom of expression is kicked to the ground , " said harderer 's publisher , fritz panzer .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .

the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .
bmw , however , has no plans to expand production of its x5 suv and z4 sports car at its assembly plant in spartanburg , south carolina . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers pin us hopes on new models as the north american international auto show gets underway in detroit this week , german carmakers are hoping new models will increase their market share in america despite the strong euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 polish secret police list opens old wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national remembrance institute archive in warsaw unlike germany , poland has n't opened up its communist-era secret file archives to the public .
now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .

the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .

the wardrobe change is expected to come into effect next year . what will the snappiest-dressed police officers be wearing this season ?
well , for most of them in europe , it will be the same old boring blue .
the greeks sweat their way through the humid streets of athens in azure , while the french gendarmerie have been advocates of bleu for as long as anyone can remember .
nothing really to get excited about in the law enforcement fashion stakes this or any other year . not unless you 're a police officer in berlin , that is .
the german capital 's cops are due to follow hamburg 's lead it as they get set to swap their mostly green-beige wardrobes for blue , possibly within the next 12 months .
freed from the seventies styling of mustard shirts and brown slacks , berlin 's finest will probably not care a jot that they are fashion followers rather than trend setters . five german states have already decided that that their police forces will be clad in blue , brandenburg is toying with the idea while in hamburg the process of wardrobe-transition has already begun .
in addition , the country 's border patrol force is also gearing up to hang up their green rags by mid-year and slip into a bluer shade . " the trend is irreversible , " berlin senator ehrhart körting told german daily berliner zeitung .
" we do not want to shut ourselves out . " what does a color mean ? but why blue ?
far from being the most sober alternative to the military green of old , many believe blue inspires calm while some say it imparts authority .
others call it a respect thing .
but the reality may be that for as long as there have been cops on tv and in film , they have been decked out in blue uniforms which have become the quintessential police outfit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york police .
most european cops say they look to new york police officers for inspiration : the new york police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- blues are famous , particularly after the arrival of the hit police drama , " nypd blue . " cheaper in the long-run berlin 's finest were n't always green .
until 1973 , they were , in fact , blue .
but the designs were old-fashioned and looked like the former army uniforms .
so they were updated- to a calming green . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american actor peter falk , most famous for his role as detective columbo , wore a police uniform on a german tv show in 2003 .
berlin resisted the trend for sometime , mostly due to the poor state of the city 's finances .
but recently , they found a solution : buying together with other municipalities can save them up to 20 percent .
and the new uniforms , at a cost of € 500 -lrb- $ 639 -rrb- each , will be € 630 cheaper when bought in bulk .
the initiative is expected to cost about € 8.8 million and take about five years .
in the meantime , berlin cops will be green - and blue . the police officers themselves say they welcome the change , particularly with the sleeker , modern cuts and breathable fabric . uniforms vs. radios in hamburg , the trailblazer of the wardrobe changes , the public is catching on , say officials .
still , bavaria resists , for good reasons , interior ministry spokesman michael ziegler told berliner zeitung . " we need our money for more important things than for uniforms in a different color , " he said .
apparently , bavarian officers put more modern communication systems ahead of looking good . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to move federal police to aid terror fight to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .

the wardrobe change is expected to come into effect next year . what will the snappiest-dressed police officers be wearing this season ?
well , for most of them in europe , it will be the same old boring blue .
the greeks sweat their way through the humid streets of athens in azure , while the french gendarmerie have been advocates of bleu for as long as anyone can remember .
nothing really to get excited about in the law enforcement fashion stakes this or any other year . not unless you 're a police officer in berlin , that is .
the german capital 's cops are due to follow hamburg 's lead it as they get set to swap their mostly green-beige wardrobes for blue , possibly within the next 12 months .
freed from the seventies styling of mustard shirts and brown slacks , berlin 's finest will probably not care a jot that they are fashion followers rather than trend setters . five german states have already decided that that their police forces will be clad in blue , brandenburg is toying with the idea while in hamburg the process of wardrobe-transition has already begun .
in addition , the country 's border patrol force is also gearing up to hang up their green rags by mid-year and slip into a bluer shade . " the trend is irreversible , " berlin senator ehrhart körting told german daily berliner zeitung .
" we do not want to shut ourselves out . " what does a color mean ? but why blue ?
far from being the most sober alternative to the military green of old , many believe blue inspires calm while some say it imparts authority .

berlin resisted the trend for sometime , mostly due to the poor state of the city 's finances .
but recently , they found a solution : buying together with other municipalities can save them up to 20 percent .
and the new uniforms , at a cost of € 500 -lrb- $ 639 -rrb- each , will be € 630 cheaper when bought in bulk .
the initiative is expected to cost about € 8.8 million and take about five years .
in the meantime , berlin cops will be green - and blue . the police officers themselves say they welcome the change , particularly with the sleeker , modern cuts and breathable fabric . uniforms vs. radios in hamburg , the trailblazer of the wardrobe changes , the public is catching on , say officials .
still , bavaria resists , for good reasons , interior ministry spokesman michael ziegler told berliner zeitung . " we need our money for more important things than for uniforms in a different color , " he said .
apparently , bavarian officers put more modern communication systems ahead of looking good . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to move federal police to aid terror fight to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .

she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .
the french leader is notably to hold private talks with bush the night the us leader arrives in brussels on february 21 . french guantanamo prisoners released ahead of rice 's arrival in paris from rome , french judicial sources told afp that the united states had agreed to release the remaining three french prisoners being held in its military base in guantanamo , cuba . the us decision to release the three french prisoners from guantanamo was also a move timed to placate france , although it may have also been prompted by a us judge 's ruling last month that military trials of prisoners at the base violated the us constitution . problems remain between france , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paratroopers of u.s. army 173rd airborne brigade guard at the harir airfield , 45 miles northeast of the kurdish city of irbil in northern iraq on friday march 28 , 2003 .

the united states has been unable to convince france to become engaged in post-conflict iraq beyond a promise to train iraqi security forces outside the violence-wracked country . it has also raised french hackles for refusing to sign on to the international criminal court , for refusing to ratify the kyoto accord and for not actively supporting efforts by france , britain and germany to reign in iran 's nuclear program through diplomatic means . another test of us-french ties will come later this week , when us defence secretary donald rumsfeld and his french counterpart , michele alliot-marie , attend an informal nato meeting in the french riviera city of nice to discuss iraq and other issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different diplomat , same strategy in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .

she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .
the french leader is notably to hold private talks with bush the night the us leader arrives in brussels on february 21 . french guantanamo prisoners released ahead of rice 's arrival in paris from rome , french judicial sources told afp that the united states had agreed to release the remaining three french prisoners being held in its military base in guantanamo , cuba . the us decision to release the three french prisoners from guantanamo was also a move timed to placate france , although it may have also been prompted by a us judge 's ruling last month that military trials of prisoners at the base violated the us constitution . problems remain between france , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paratroopers of u.s. army 173rd airborne brigade guard at the harir airfield , 45 miles northeast of the kurdish city of irbil in northern iraq on friday march 28 , 2003 .

the wardrobe change is expected to come into effect next year . what will the snappiest-dressed police officers be wearing this season ?
well , for most of them in europe , it will be the same old boring blue .
the greeks sweat their way through the humid streets of athens in azure , while the french gendarmerie have been advocates of bleu for as long as anyone can remember .
nothing really to get excited about in the law enforcement fashion stakes this or any other year . not unless you 're a police officer in berlin , that is .
the german capital 's cops are due to follow hamburg 's lead it as they get set to swap their mostly green-beige wardrobes for blue , possibly within the next 12 months .
freed from the seventies styling of mustard shirts and brown slacks , berlin 's finest will probably not care a jot that they are fashion followers rather than trend setters . five german states have already decided that that their police forces will be clad in blue , brandenburg is toying with the idea while in hamburg the process of wardrobe-transition has already begun .
in addition , the country 's border patrol force is also gearing up to hang up their green rags by mid-year and slip into a bluer shade . " the trend is irreversible , " berlin senator ehrhart körting told german daily berliner zeitung .
" we do not want to shut ourselves out . " what does a color mean ? but why blue ?
far from being the most sober alternative to the military green of old , many believe blue inspires calm while some say it imparts authority .

so they were updated- to a calming green . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american actor peter falk , most famous for his role as detective columbo , wore a police uniform on a german tv show in 2003 .
berlin resisted the trend for sometime , mostly due to the poor state of the city 's finances .
but recently , they found a solution : buying together with other municipalities can save them up to 20 percent .
and the new uniforms , at a cost of € 500 -lrb- $ 639 -rrb- each , will be € 630 cheaper when bought in bulk .
the initiative is expected to cost about € 8.8 million and take about five years .
in the meantime , berlin cops will be green - and blue . the police officers themselves say they welcome the change , particularly with the sleeker , modern cuts and breathable fabric . uniforms vs. radios in hamburg , the trailblazer of the wardrobe changes , the public is catching on , say officials .
still , bavaria resists , for good reasons , interior ministry spokesman michael ziegler told berliner zeitung . " we need our money for more important things than for uniforms in a different color , " he said .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .
the whirlwind itinerary was largely to set the scene for a february 21-24 visit by us president bush . important appearance for critical rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris leg was considered the most important for rice , who in 2003 famously said that washington should " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia " for opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq to look for supposed weapons of mass destruction . her speech on tuesday contained less inflammatory language and suggested that washington was now serious about smoothing over the dispute and restoring us-european cooperation to its former strength . rice also spoke warmly of the relationship between france and the united states , saying that the two countries had a shared past and , more importantly , a shared future .
she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .
the french leader is notably to hold private talks with bush the night the us leader arrives in brussels on february 21 . french guantanamo prisoners released ahead of rice 's arrival in paris from rome , french judicial sources told afp that the united states had agreed to release the remaining three french prisoners being held in its military base in guantanamo , cuba . the us decision to release the three french prisoners from guantanamo was also a move timed to placate france , although it may have also been prompted by a us judge 's ruling last month that military trials of prisoners at the base violated the us constitution . problems remain between france , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paratroopers of u.s. army 173rd airborne brigade guard at the harir airfield , 45 miles northeast of the kurdish city of irbil in northern iraq on friday march 28 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / hasan sarbakhshian -rrb- nevertheless , differences remain .
the united states has been unable to convince france to become engaged in post-conflict iraq beyond a promise to train iraqi security forces outside the violence-wracked country . it has also raised french hackles for refusing to sign on to the international criminal court , for refusing to ratify the kyoto accord and for not actively supporting efforts by france , britain and germany to reign in iran 's nuclear program through diplomatic means . another test of us-french ties will come later this week , when us defence secretary donald rumsfeld and his french counterpart , michele alliot-marie , attend an informal nato meeting in the french riviera city of nice to discuss iraq and other issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different diplomat , same strategy in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 different diplomat , same strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : successor and predecessor : rice and powell in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat . her choice to hold her first important speech as us secretary of state in the french capital reflects rice 's public image of being a tough and straightforward politician .
it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .
" and the europeans have realized that they must somehow cooperate with america if they want to be relevant . " michael knigge -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to prepare germany for bush far from ignoring germany as she once famously suggested , us secretary of state condoleezza rice will discuss the war in iraq and tensions with iran in berlin on friday ahead of her boss 's visit later this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 different diplomat , same strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : successor and predecessor : rice and powell in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat . her choice to hold her first important speech as us secretary of state in the french capital reflects rice 's public image of being a tough and straightforward politician .
it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .
" and the europeans have realized that they must somehow cooperate with america if they want to be relevant .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .

the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .
in some countries , it has sparked protests and a czech lawmaker wanted the author fined .

the wardrobe change is expected to come into effect next year . what will the snappiest-dressed police officers be wearing this season ?
well , for most of them in europe , it will be the same old boring blue .
the greeks sweat their way through the humid streets of athens in azure , while the french gendarmerie have been advocates of bleu for as long as anyone can remember .
nothing really to get excited about in the law enforcement fashion stakes this or any other year . not unless you 're a police officer in berlin , that is .
the german capital 's cops are due to follow hamburg 's lead it as they get set to swap their mostly green-beige wardrobes for blue , possibly within the next 12 months .
freed from the seventies styling of mustard shirts and brown slacks , berlin 's finest will probably not care a jot that they are fashion followers rather than trend setters . five german states have already decided that that their police forces will be clad in blue , brandenburg is toying with the idea while in hamburg the process of wardrobe-transition has already begun .
in addition , the country 's border patrol force is also gearing up to hang up their green rags by mid-year and slip into a bluer shade . " the trend is irreversible , " berlin senator ehrhart körting told german daily berliner zeitung .
" we do not want to shut ourselves out . " what does a color mean ? but why blue ?
far from being the most sober alternative to the military green of old , many believe blue inspires calm while some say it imparts authority .
others call it a respect thing .
but the reality may be that for as long as there have been cops on tv and in film , they have been decked out in blue uniforms which have become the quintessential police outfit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york police .
most european cops say they look to new york police officers for inspiration : the new york police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- blues are famous , particularly after the arrival of the hit police drama , " nypd blue . " cheaper in the long-run berlin 's finest were n't always green .
until 1973 , they were , in fact , blue .
but the designs were old-fashioned and looked like the former army uniforms .
so they were updated- to a calming green . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american actor peter falk , most famous for his role as detective columbo , wore a police uniform on a german tv show in 2003 .
berlin resisted the trend for sometime , mostly due to the poor state of the city 's finances .
but recently , they found a solution : buying together with other municipalities can save them up to 20 percent .
and the new uniforms , at a cost of € 500 -lrb- $ 639 -rrb- each , will be € 630 cheaper when bought in bulk .
the initiative is expected to cost about € 8.8 million and take about five years .
in the meantime , berlin cops will be green - and blue . the police officers themselves say they welcome the change , particularly with the sleeker , modern cuts and breathable fabric . uniforms vs. radios in hamburg , the trailblazer of the wardrobe changes , the public is catching on , say officials .
still , bavaria resists , for good reasons , interior ministry spokesman michael ziegler told berliner zeitung . " we need our money for more important things than for uniforms in a different color , " he said .
apparently , bavarian officers put more modern communication systems ahead of looking good . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to move federal police to aid terror fight to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .

china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .
jesus on a surfing trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surfing jesus the book is controversial because of its out-of-the-ordinary depictions of jesus , such as one of his crossing the sea of galilee naked on a surfboard , receiving divine inspiration from frankincense .
one illustration recasts the last supper as a drinking binge .
characters such as fashion designer karl lagerfeld and the late guitar wonder jimi hendrix mingle with jesus in the tales .
the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .
in some countries , it has sparked protests and a czech lawmaker wanted the author fined .
but in no other country has the book been banned .
" after all , greece is a member of the european union and , so you would think , not a religious state in which an artist 's freedom of expression is kicked to the ground , " said harderer 's publisher , fritz panzer .
blasphemy laws hinder artistic freedom the crackdown on the book was condemned by the geneva-based international publishers ' association -lrb- ipa -rrb- because of concerns that the ruling will hinder other authors .
bildunterschrift : gerhard haderer poses in front of one of his comics " while ipa opposes all forms of religious intolerance , it stands for the elimination of all prohibitions limiting freedom of expression whether imposed by governments or by religious authorities , " ipa officials wrote in a statement . vivian papanayotou -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .
debate has already begun raging on its violence and message even before the first showing on thursday .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .

the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .
opposition parties have promised to bring the troops home at the end of their mandate in june if elected .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .
the whirlwind itinerary was largely to set the scene for a february 21-24 visit by us president bush . important appearance for critical rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris leg was considered the most important for rice , who in 2003 famously said that washington should " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia " for opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq to look for supposed weapons of mass destruction . her speech on tuesday contained less inflammatory language and suggested that washington was now serious about smoothing over the dispute and restoring us-european cooperation to its former strength . rice also spoke warmly of the relationship between france and the united states , saying that the two countries had a shared past and , more importantly , a shared future .
she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .
the french leader is notably to hold private talks with bush the night the us leader arrives in brussels on february 21 . french guantanamo prisoners released ahead of rice 's arrival in paris from rome , french judicial sources told afp that the united states had agreed to release the remaining three french prisoners being held in its military base in guantanamo , cuba . the us decision to release the three french prisoners from guantanamo was also a move timed to placate france , although it may have also been prompted by a us judge 's ruling last month that military trials of prisoners at the base violated the us constitution . problems remain between france , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paratroopers of u.s. army 173rd airborne brigade guard at the harir airfield , 45 miles northeast of the kurdish city of irbil in northern iraq on friday march 28 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / hasan sarbakhshian -rrb- nevertheless , differences remain .
the united states has been unable to convince france to become engaged in post-conflict iraq beyond a promise to train iraqi security forces outside the violence-wracked country . it has also raised french hackles for refusing to sign on to the international criminal court , for refusing to ratify the kyoto accord and for not actively supporting efforts by france , britain and germany to reign in iran 's nuclear program through diplomatic means . another test of us-french ties will come later this week , when us defence secretary donald rumsfeld and his french counterpart , michele alliot-marie , attend an informal nato meeting in the french riviera city of nice to discuss iraq and other issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different diplomat , same strategy in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .

but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions .

" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .

" there is already a lot being done .

in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 danes set to re-elect center-right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier anders fogh rasmussen -lrb- left -rrb- plans on celebrating his win as danes prepare to vote in tuesday 's general election , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen looks well placed to retain power after a campaign dominated by the robust economy , the welfare state , taxes and immigration . public opinions polls point to a commanding victory for rasmussen 's liberal party and its coalition partner the conservatives , who are informally backed in parliament by the far-right danish people 's party .
the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .
opposition parties have promised to bring the troops home at the end of their mandate in june if elected .

the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .
" but if these steps do n't lead to success , then a ban should n't be ruled out .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .

" the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .
" but if these steps do n't lead to success , then a ban should n't be ruled out .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .
" and the europeans have realized that they must somehow cooperate with america if they want to be relevant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.02.2005 weak dollar unnerves german car giants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : profits on cars made in germany and sold in the us could be slashed german auto manufacturers are facing the prospect of having their us profits from imported models slashed due to the weak performance of the dollar .
for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .
opposition parties have promised to bring the troops home at the end of their mandate in june if elected .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .
opposition parties have promised to bring the troops home at the end of their mandate in june if elected .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .

on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .
" the battle comes down to a personality contest between rasmussen and -lrb- social democrat leader mogens -rrb- lykketoft , " a duel the prime minister wins hands down thanks to his charisma , bille said . criticism from human rights groups denmark 's immigration policy , possibly the most restrictive in europe , has been one of the biggest issues in the campaign .
the issue was instrumental in sweeping rasmussen to power in 2001 , when he vowed to limit the number of immigrants allowed into the country in order to focus efforts on better integrating foreigners already living there . influenced by its key ally the far-right danish people 's party , the government has implemented a slew of restrictions , including delaying refugees ' eligibility for permanent residence permits from three years to seven , restricting asylum conditions for conscientious objectors and persecuted homosexuals , and reducing welfare payments for new immigrants to make denmark a less attractive destination . while the measures have been highly controversial , earning denmark harsh criticism from human rights groups , they are widely accepted by a majority of danes . wary of losing even more voters , the social democrats have said they will not alter the current policy if they are elected .
but rasmussen and the danish people 's party have suggested that a social democratic government would eventually reopen the borders .
almost 5 percent of the 5.4 million people in denmark are immigrants .
the figure reaches 8 percent if those who have acquired danish citizenship are included .
danish troops in iraq another heated debate has concerned the government 's controversial decision to participate in the iraq war .
the government has tried to avoid any discussion on the subject , well aware that it is one of few issues that could threaten its hold on power . a clear majority of danes remain opposed to denmark 's involvement in the war and want the 525 danish soldiers deployed in iraq brought home .
opposition parties have promised to bring the troops home at the end of their mandate in june if elected .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .
" and the europeans have realized that they must somehow cooperate with america if they want to be relevant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 polish secret police list opens old wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national remembrance institute archive in warsaw unlike germany , poland has n't opened up its communist-era secret file archives to the public .
now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .
" we 're going to witness an ever increasing number of sensational claims that will surface on the internet and in the media , " said szetyna .
" but , we 'll never be sure whether they 've been investigated or whether they 're false .

after complaints from the german chapter of people for the ethical treatment of animals -lrb- peta -rrb- , daimlerchrysler said its mercedes subsidiary will offer fabric or synthetic leather as options .
daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said that far from wanting leather-free cars , " our customers ... are more likely to want even more leather at the premium end .
but we 'll make cars without leather on demand . "
peta officials , who had threatened protests at the carmaker 's stuttgart headquarters , said they were delighted .
" when you consider that the skins of four to 15 cows are needed for each car this means thousands of cows will be spared , " said peta researcher edmund haferbeck .
" this is a huge victory for animal rights .

a luxury hotel is about to open near the spot where nazi dictator adolf hitler once relaxed .
resort officials hope that fancy spa treatments and an exhibit about the nazis will help overcome the shadows of the past . hermann göring lived on the site .
hitler wrote part of " mein kampf " here and had his own retreat built nearby .
the nazis made this alpine hideaway their second capital .
but on march 1 , the british-owned intercontinental resort will try and plant another reputation on the famous and infamous alpine area of obersalzberg - that of luxury and wellness .
meanwhile , many are asking if the resort can or should , successfully do so . spa treatments and nazi history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new luxury hotel is nearing completion it 's a moot point .
the 135-room stone and glass complex with luxurious rooms and two-level suites is decorated with the carefully chosen art of nazi-banned painter , otto müller , feng shui methods and alpine panorama .
the hotel has installed modern ski lifts and offers a wide range of spa services including ones based on aboriginal healing techniques and eastern massages . the hotel is not trying to evade history but to accommodate it .
the staff is available to answer questions on the history of the area and direct guests to the nearby obersalzberg documentation center which narrates the region 's history including its nazi chapter . nazi hideaway berchtesgaden attracted the top nazi leadership such as joseph goebbels , hermann göring , rudolf hess and albert speer who vacationed in the mountains and planned the business of the government , including the murder of millions of jews . besides their houses , the nazis constructed a landing strip , bunker complex and green house to supply fresh vegetables . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's " berghof " lay in ruins after the war and was demolished by the us army in 1952 .
almost all buildings were destroyed during allied bombings in 1945 , except for the eagle 's nest tea house , hitler 's favorite hangout .
in later years , the area became a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis marking hitler 's birthday . appropriate ? these days , some critics are asking whether it is appropriately to have such facility on so infamous a site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird 's view of the new resort " yes , " hotel director jörg t. böckeler told dpa news agency .
" we , with this hotel , will begin a new tourist chapter in the history of berchtesgaden . " but jewish writer ralph giordano criticized the buildings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 different diplomat , same strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : successor and predecessor : rice and powell in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat . her choice to hold her first important speech as us secretary of state in the french capital reflects rice 's public image of being a tough and straightforward politician .
it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .

china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads .

" she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .
" and the europeans have realized that they must somehow cooperate with america if they want to be relevant . " michael knigge -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice to prepare germany for bush far from ignoring germany as she once famously suggested , us secretary of state condoleezza rice will discuss the war in iraq and tensions with iran in berlin on friday ahead of her boss 's visit later this month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.02.2005 rice calls for " new chapter " in transatlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new us secretary of state has adopted a conciliatory tone condoleezza rice used a speech in paris on tuesday to begin mending bridges with the french government and to urge europe to " stand ready " to work with the us . the new us secretary of state arrived in paris on tuesday and urged europe to " stand ready to work with america " in a speech seen as the key moment of an eight-nation tour which was to include talks with french president jacques chirac . rice 's choice of the french capital for her address was carefully chosen .
chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .
the whirlwind itinerary was largely to set the scene for a february 21-24 visit by us president bush . important appearance for critical rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris leg was considered the most important for rice , who in 2003 famously said that washington should " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia " for opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq to look for supposed weapons of mass destruction . her speech on tuesday contained less inflammatory language and suggested that washington was now serious about smoothing over the dispute and restoring us-european cooperation to its former strength . rice also spoke warmly of the relationship between france and the united states , saying that the two countries had a shared past and , more importantly , a shared future .
she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .

the wardrobe change is expected to come into effect next year . what will the snappiest-dressed police officers be wearing this season ?
well , for most of them in europe , it will be the same old boring blue .
the greeks sweat their way through the humid streets of athens in azure , while the french gendarmerie have been advocates of bleu for as long as anyone can remember .
nothing really to get excited about in the law enforcement fashion stakes this or any other year . not unless you 're a police officer in berlin , that is .

freed from the seventies styling of mustard shirts and brown slacks , berlin 's finest will probably not care a jot that they are fashion followers rather than trend setters . five german states have already decided that that their police forces will be clad in blue , brandenburg is toying with the idea while in hamburg the process of wardrobe-transition has already begun .
in addition , the country 's border patrol force is also gearing up to hang up their green rags by mid-year and slip into a bluer shade . " the trend is irreversible , " berlin senator ehrhart körting told german daily berliner zeitung .
" we do not want to shut ourselves out . " what does a color mean ? but why blue ?
far from being the most sober alternative to the military green of old , many believe blue inspires calm while some say it imparts authority .
others call it a respect thing .
but the reality may be that for as long as there have been cops on tv and in film , they have been decked out in blue uniforms which have become the quintessential police outfit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york police .
most european cops say they look to new york police officers for inspiration : the new york police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- blues are famous , particularly after the arrival of the hit police drama , " nypd blue . " cheaper in the long-run berlin 's finest were n't always green .
until 1973 , they were , in fact , blue .
but the designs were old-fashioned and looked like the former army uniforms .
so they were updated- to a calming green . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american actor peter falk , most famous for his role as detective columbo , wore a police uniform on a german tv show in 2003 .
berlin resisted the trend for sometime , mostly due to the poor state of the city 's finances .
but recently , they found a solution : buying together with other municipalities can save them up to 20 percent .
and the new uniforms , at a cost of € 500 -lrb- $ 639 -rrb- each , will be € 630 cheaper when bought in bulk .
the initiative is expected to cost about € 8.8 million and take about five years .
in the meantime , berlin cops will be green - and blue . the police officers themselves say they welcome the change , particularly with the sleeker , modern cuts and breathable fabric . uniforms vs. radios in hamburg , the trailblazer of the wardrobe changes , the public is catching on , say officials .
still , bavaria resists , for good reasons , interior ministry spokesman michael ziegler told berliner zeitung . " we need our money for more important things than for uniforms in a different color , " he said .
apparently , bavarian officers put more modern communication systems ahead of looking good . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to move federal police to aid terror fight to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .
the announcement comes shortly after the foreign intelligence service said it would also move to the capital .

nothing really to get excited about in the law enforcement fashion stakes this or any other year . not unless you 're a police officer in berlin , that is .
the german capital 's cops are due to follow hamburg 's lead it as they get set to swap their mostly green-beige wardrobes for blue , possibly within the next 12 months .
freed from the seventies styling of mustard shirts and brown slacks , berlin 's finest will probably not care a jot that they are fashion followers rather than trend setters . five german states have already decided that that their police forces will be clad in blue , brandenburg is toying with the idea while in hamburg the process of wardrobe-transition has already begun .
in addition , the country 's border patrol force is also gearing up to hang up their green rags by mid-year and slip into a bluer shade . " the trend is irreversible , " berlin senator ehrhart körting told german daily berliner zeitung .
" we do not want to shut ourselves out . " what does a color mean ? but why blue ?
far from being the most sober alternative to the military green of old , many believe blue inspires calm while some say it imparts authority .

berlin resisted the trend for sometime , mostly due to the poor state of the city 's finances .

and the new uniforms , at a cost of € 500 -lrb- $ 639 -rrb- each , will be € 630 cheaper when bought in bulk .
the initiative is expected to cost about € 8.8 million and take about five years .
in the meantime , berlin cops will be green - and blue . the police officers themselves say they welcome the change , particularly with the sleeker , modern cuts and breathable fabric . uniforms vs. radios in hamburg , the trailblazer of the wardrobe changes , the public is catching on , say officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.02.2005 weak dollar unnerves german car giants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : profits on cars made in germany and sold in the us could be slashed german auto manufacturers are facing the prospect of having their us profits from imported models slashed due to the weak performance of the dollar .
for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .
bmw , however , has no plans to expand production of its x5 suv and z4 sports car at its assembly plant in spartanburg , south carolina . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers pin us hopes on new models as the north american international auto show gets underway in detroit this week , german carmakers are hoping new models will increase their market share in america despite the strong euro .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit .

for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.02.2005 berlin 's finest go blue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to berlin streets berlin 's police force will get a chic new look as they swap their green uniforms for blue .
the wardrobe change is expected to come into effect next year . what will the snappiest-dressed police officers be wearing this season ?
well , for most of them in europe , it will be the same old boring blue .
the greeks sweat their way through the humid streets of athens in azure , while the french gendarmerie have been advocates of bleu for as long as anyone can remember .
nothing really to get excited about in the law enforcement fashion stakes this or any other year . not unless you 're a police officer in berlin , that is .
the german capital 's cops are due to follow hamburg 's lead it as they get set to swap their mostly green-beige wardrobes for blue , possibly within the next 12 months .
freed from the seventies styling of mustard shirts and brown slacks , berlin 's finest will probably not care a jot that they are fashion followers rather than trend setters . five german states have already decided that that their police forces will be clad in blue , brandenburg is toying with the idea while in hamburg the process of wardrobe-transition has already begun .
in addition , the country 's border patrol force is also gearing up to hang up their green rags by mid-year and slip into a bluer shade . " the trend is irreversible , " berlin senator ehrhart körting told german daily berliner zeitung .
" we do not want to shut ourselves out . " what does a color mean ? but why blue ?
far from being the most sober alternative to the military green of old , many believe blue inspires calm while some say it imparts authority .
others call it a respect thing .
but the reality may be that for as long as there have been cops on tv and in film , they have been decked out in blue uniforms which have become the quintessential police outfit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york police .
most european cops say they look to new york police officers for inspiration : the new york police department -lrb- nypd -rrb- blues are famous , particularly after the arrival of the hit police drama , " nypd blue . " cheaper in the long-run berlin 's finest were n't always green .
until 1973 , they were , in fact , blue .
but the designs were old-fashioned and looked like the former army uniforms .
so they were updated- to a calming green . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american actor peter falk , most famous for his role as detective columbo , wore a police uniform on a german tv show in 2003 .
berlin resisted the trend for sometime , mostly due to the poor state of the city 's finances .
but recently , they found a solution : buying together with other municipalities can save them up to 20 percent .
and the new uniforms , at a cost of € 500 -lrb- $ 639 -rrb- each , will be € 630 cheaper when bought in bulk .
the initiative is expected to cost about € 8.8 million and take about five years .
in the meantime , berlin cops will be green - and blue . the police officers themselves say they welcome the change , particularly with the sleeker , modern cuts and breathable fabric . uniforms vs. radios in hamburg , the trailblazer of the wardrobe changes , the public is catching on , say officials .
still , bavaria resists , for good reasons , interior ministry spokesman michael ziegler told berliner zeitung . " we need our money for more important things than for uniforms in a different color , " he said .
apparently , bavarian officers put more modern communication systems ahead of looking good . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to move federal police to aid terror fight to better coordinate germany ’ s efforts against terrorism , the federal police will relocate to berlin .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .

mitsubishi motors corp. said it would make a cash payment and transfer its remaining 20 percent stake in mitsubishi fuso truck and bus corp. to the german-us car giant under an agreement expected to be made final in march .
the amount of the cash compensation has yet to be finalized , a mitsubishi motors spokesman said , although it was estimated by japanese media at some 20 billion yen -lrb- $ 190 million -rrb- .
the associated transfer of the shares would bring daimlerchrysler ag 's stake in the truck and bus maker to 85 percent .
daimlerchrysler had acquired from mitsubishi motors a 65 percent stake in mitsubishi fuso for about 140 billion yen by march 2004 , but soon afterwards mitsubishi fuso 's past defect cover-up attempts were disclosed .
claiming the scandal greatly eroded the value of its investment in mitsubishi fuso , daimlerchrysler notified mitsubishi motors last june it was considering demanding compensation based on a clause in the stock transfer agreement . dw-world.de dubai buys big stake in daimlerchrysler the emirate of dubai has purchased $ 1 billion in shares in germany 's daimlerchrysler , becoming the company 's third largest shareholder .
the purchase may lead to daimler investing in a dubai-based manufacturing facility .

a luxury hotel is about to open near the spot where nazi dictator adolf hitler once relaxed .
resort officials hope that fancy spa treatments and an exhibit about the nazis will help overcome the shadows of the past . hermann göring lived on the site .
hitler wrote part of " mein kampf " here and had his own retreat built nearby .
the nazis made this alpine hideaway their second capital .
but on march 1 , the british-owned intercontinental resort will try and plant another reputation on the famous and infamous alpine area of obersalzberg - that of luxury and wellness .
meanwhile , many are asking if the resort can or should , successfully do so . spa treatments and nazi history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new luxury hotel is nearing completion it 's a moot point .
the 135-room stone and glass complex with luxurious rooms and two-level suites is decorated with the carefully chosen art of nazi-banned painter , otto müller , feng shui methods and alpine panorama .
the hotel has installed modern ski lifts and offers a wide range of spa services including ones based on aboriginal healing techniques and eastern massages . the hotel is not trying to evade history but to accommodate it .
the staff is available to answer questions on the history of the area and direct guests to the nearby obersalzberg documentation center which narrates the region 's history including its nazi chapter . nazi hideaway berchtesgaden attracted the top nazi leadership such as joseph goebbels , hermann göring , rudolf hess and albert speer who vacationed in the mountains and planned the business of the government , including the murder of millions of jews . besides their houses , the nazis constructed a landing strip , bunker complex and green house to supply fresh vegetables . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler 's " berghof " lay in ruins after the war and was demolished by the us army in 1952 .
almost all buildings were destroyed during allied bombings in 1945 , except for the eagle 's nest tea house , hitler 's favorite hangout .
in later years , the area became a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis marking hitler 's birthday . appropriate ? these days , some critics are asking whether it is appropriately to have such facility on so infamous a site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird 's view of the new resort " yes , " hotel director jörg t. böckeler told dpa news agency .
" we , with this hotel , will begin a new tourist chapter in the history of berchtesgaden . " but jewish writer ralph giordano criticized the buildings . " either these people do not know what obersalzberg stands for , which would be bad enough , or they know exactly and do it anyway , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berchtesgaden : promoting sustainable development the berchtesgaden biosphere reserve is a unique alpine environment that everyone hopes will survive the pressures of a changing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.02.2005 different diplomat , same strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : successor and predecessor : rice and powell in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat . her choice to hold her first important speech as us secretary of state in the french capital reflects rice 's public image of being a tough and straightforward politician .
it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .
she 'll aim to bridge the transatlantic divide and stress shared values while emphasizing the united states ' special role . what to expect " you can surely expect a buzzword in rice 's speech , " said james davis , who knows rice from working at the council on foreign relations think tank .
" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .
" and the europeans have realized that they must somehow cooperate with america if they want to be relevant .

it shows that rice is willing to go where it could hurt the most politically . " she wanted to do it in paris because she felt paris was one of the places where there 's a lot of debate and discussion about the us , about europe , about common goals , about how we achieve our agenda , " said her spokesman , richard boucher . rice 's mission is clearly to explain the bush administration 's plans to the europeans , to mediate between the europeans and the americans .

" president bush sr. offered the germans ' partnership in leadership . '
rice could offer the europeans something similar , though it always remains clear who 's primus inter pares . " davies , a political scientist at the university of munich , explained what the europeans have to expect from rice . " she is always extremely well prepared and has herself very well under control , " he said .
" she does n't like to make small talk and she does n't like to go to receptions and dinners . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush smiles at the new secretary of state condoleezza rice and she has one invaluable advantage above her predecessor powell , according to davies : private access to president bush .
due to her close relationship to bush as national security advisor , she has a direct line to the white house . " she really speaks for the president , and that is worth a lot , " he said .
" colin powell was never part of the bush administration 's inner circle . " iraq , iran and china that 's why rice will be able to more effectively communicate to the white house and the national security council the views of her eu counterparts than powell could .
but rice wo n't bring strategic change to us foreign policies . " european-american relations will improve in style and , above all , in atmosphere , but in strategic basic decisions there wo n't be rapprochement with a secretary of state rice either , " said stephan bierling , an expert on us foreign policy at the university of regensburg .
" the americans ' absolute priority triad - iraq , china and iran - continues unchanged , and in all three aspects , the europeans , particularly germany and france , have nothing to add . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers besides the familiar points of conflict - iraq and iran - the americans and the europeans are heading for a confrontation over china , bierling said .
china is the only country in the world that is developing war plans - over taiwan - against the us , he claimed .
at the same time , the eu is discussed lifting weapons sanctions against china . learning from the past since agreement between the us and numerous european states on the big issues remains inconceivable for the time being , americans and europeans are now trying to bake smaller transatlantic breads . " there can surely be improvement in relations and agreement on secondary points , like stabilizing afghanistan , wto talks or the middle east conflict , although the europeans ca n't offer the americans much in these areas , " bierling said . the differences are still there , though davies contended that both sides had learned from the conflicts of the past years . " we can do everything alone , but it 's damned expensive and it is n't much fun - that could be washington 's line now , " he said .
" and the europeans have realized that they must somehow cooperate with america if they want to be relevant .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .
the sb had records on some 98,000 " secret spies " in 1988 , shortly before the fall of communism . today , poland has legislation whereby all members of parliament , judges and high-ranking officials have to state whether they worked with the former secret police before they take up their posts .
if they are found to be lying , they lose their positions . however , that legislation does n't apply to the media and private industry , where people have been tacitly expected to draw a line under their pasts .
but the publication of the wildstein list has added pressure to out even those in the private sector who had past dealings with the sb . list sparks panic the list 's posting on the internet has also sent alarm bells ringing through poland 's existing secret service because it contains the names of agents who are still active . polish prime minister marek belka has already demanded the polish secret service ensure that agents on active duty are n't affected by the wildstein revelations . the publication of the list - which contains names of both spies and ordinary citizens who were observed - has also incensed certain poles who fear that their unknowing relatives or friends might be mentioned in the same breath as the agents .
" now everybody is going to panic .
that 's going to lead to a lot of confusion , " jerzy brykczynska , an engineer in warsaw , told german daily berliner morgenpost . fear of false claims journalist wildstein , who has already been fired by his paper rzeczpospolita for mixing journalism with politics , has insisted that not everybody on the list were members of the secret police . " i do n't want to morally lynch anyone , " he said .
" nobody has said that it 's only a list of agents . " but , some remain unconvinced .
leon kieres , head of the national remembrance institute warned of a looming witch hunt and accused wildstein of being irresponsible . " if someone talks of a secret service list then he 's responsible for those whom the institute has recognized as ' victims ' , but also for those who as party officials or secret service members are not on the list , " he said . grzegorz szetyna of the liberal-conservative citizens ' platform said the list would lead to further misuse of secret service files .

now , an internet publication by a polish journalist of a list containing names of informers and victims has sparked uproar . no other topic attracts more fierce debate these days in poland than the " wildstein list . "
it refers to the publication on the internet by polish journalist bronislaw wildstein of a list containing 240,000 names of former agents of the secret service police , covert informers and proven victims of the former communist regime 's elaborate espionage network . wildstein is reported to have carted off the list from the archives of the country 's national remembrance institute - a polish version of germany 's secret police archive , set up to investigate one of the biggest domestic espionage systems in history - and unlawfully copied and posted it on the internet . according to conservative polish daily rzeczpospolita , whose payrolls wildstein was on as an editor until recently , the internet page displaying the list is the most-viewed site in poland currently , receiving up to 100,000 clicks daily . polish state under pressure the publication of the wildstein list , which is almost 50 pages long , is now expected to increase pressure on the polish state to open up its communist-era secret police archives .
the whole issue has triggered an angry debate in the country and is being called the worst secret police scandal in post-cold war poland . until now , poland has largely kept its communist-era secret files tightly under wraps , raising criticism that the country has not done enough to confront its past . in germany , two million applications were filed by people wanting to have a look at the files that were kept on them by the east german secret police , the stasi , and 40,000 similar applications in the czech republic .
in poland , just 14,000 such requests have been registered , where citizens have been allowed to look at their files since july 2000 . shedding light on murky past the wildstein list is expected to provide further fuel for what is already a explosive debate in poland about learning the true identity of former informers and members of the secret police who have took up ordinary jobs in the government and the private sector after the iron curtain fell . poland 's secret police , known as the sb , has much in common with other secret police agencies in former communist countries in that it was known for its brutality and kept tabs on much of the population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.02.2005 rice calls for " new chapter " in transatlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new us secretary of state has adopted a conciliatory tone condoleezza rice used a speech in paris on tuesday to begin mending bridges with the french government and to urge europe to " stand ready " to work with the us . the new us secretary of state arrived in paris on tuesday and urged europe to " stand ready to work with america " in a speech seen as the key moment of an eight-nation tour which was to include talks with french president jacques chirac . rice 's choice of the french capital for her address was carefully chosen .
chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .
the whirlwind itinerary was largely to set the scene for a february 21-24 visit by us president bush . important appearance for critical rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris leg was considered the most important for rice , who in 2003 famously said that washington should " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia " for opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq to look for supposed weapons of mass destruction . her speech on tuesday contained less inflammatory language and suggested that washington was now serious about smoothing over the dispute and restoring us-european cooperation to its former strength . rice also spoke warmly of the relationship between france and the united states , saying that the two countries had a shared past and , more importantly , a shared future .
she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .

chirac and his government led european opposition to the us invasion of iraq in 2003 and paris-washington ties remain frosty some two years later . in remarks prepared for delivery at the sciences politiques university in paris before her meeting with chirac , rice - one of president george w. bush 's closest advisors - called for " a new chapter " in the transatlantic relationship . speech readies europe to work with america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " america stands ready to work with europe on our common agenda , and europe must stand ready to work with america , " rice told gathered academics and officials .
" it is time to turn away from the disagreements of the past .
it is time to open a new chapter in our relationship , and a new chapter in our alliance . " america , she said , had everything to gain from a stronger europe as a partner in building a safer and a better world where both could " work for the cause of freedom . "
history , rice added , " will surely judge us not by our old disagreements , but by our new achievements . " france was the sixth stop of a tour that has already taken her to britain , germany , poland , turkey , israel and the palestinian territories , and italy .
she was to wrap up the trip on thursday after stopping in belgium .
the whirlwind itinerary was largely to set the scene for a february 21-24 visit by us president bush . important appearance for critical rice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the paris leg was considered the most important for rice , who in 2003 famously said that washington should " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia " for opposing bush 's decision to invade iraq to look for supposed weapons of mass destruction . her speech on tuesday contained less inflammatory language and suggested that washington was now serious about smoothing over the dispute and restoring us-european cooperation to its former strength . rice also spoke warmly of the relationship between france and the united states , saying that the two countries had a shared past and , more importantly , a shared future .
she added that both countries were built on the idea of liberty and had worked together with other nations within europe in the spread of freedom . chirac , too , has been making conciliatory noises of late .
the french leader is notably to hold private talks with bush the night the us leader arrives in brussels on february 21 . french guantanamo prisoners released ahead of rice 's arrival in paris from rome , french judicial sources told afp that the united states had agreed to release the remaining three french prisoners being held in its military base in guantanamo , cuba . the us decision to release the three french prisoners from guantanamo was also a move timed to placate france , although it may have also been prompted by a us judge 's ruling last month that military trials of prisoners at the base violated the us constitution . problems remain between france , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paratroopers of u.s. army 173rd airborne brigade guard at the harir airfield , 45 miles northeast of the kurdish city of irbil in northern iraq on friday march 28 , 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / hasan sarbakhshian -rrb- nevertheless , differences remain .
the united states has been unable to convince france to become engaged in post-conflict iraq beyond a promise to train iraqi security forces outside the violence-wracked country . it has also raised french hackles for refusing to sign on to the international criminal court , for refusing to ratify the kyoto accord and for not actively supporting efforts by france , britain and germany to reign in iran 's nuclear program through diplomatic means . another test of us-french ties will come later this week , when us defence secretary donald rumsfeld and his french counterpart , michele alliot-marie , attend an informal nato meeting in the french riviera city of nice to discuss iraq and other issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de different diplomat , same strategy in paris , the heart of opposition against the iraq war , condoleezza rice plans to give her first speech on us-european relations since becoming the united states ' top diplomat .

they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .
jesus on a surfing trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surfing jesus the book is controversial because of its out-of-the-ordinary depictions of jesus , such as one of his crossing the sea of galilee naked on a surfboard , receiving divine inspiration from frankincense .
one illustration recasts the last supper as a drinking binge .
characters such as fashion designer karl lagerfeld and the late guitar wonder jimi hendrix mingle with jesus in the tales .
the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .
in some countries , it has sparked protests and a czech lawmaker wanted the author fined .
but in no other country has the book been banned .
" after all , greece is a member of the european union and , so you would think , not a religious state in which an artist 's freedom of expression is kicked to the ground , " said harderer 's publisher , fritz panzer .
blasphemy laws hinder artistic freedom the crackdown on the book was condemned by the geneva-based international publishers ' association -lrb- ipa -rrb- because of concerns that the ruling will hinder other authors .
bildunterschrift : gerhard haderer poses in front of one of his comics " while ipa opposes all forms of religious intolerance , it stands for the elimination of all prohibitions limiting freedom of expression whether imposed by governments or by religious authorities , " ipa officials wrote in a statement . vivian papanayotou -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good .

" we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .

the minority government 's popularity is largely attributed to the fact that it has kept its controversial 2001 election promise to curb immigration , one of voters ' top concerns , and has restored denmark 's economy to good health : growth is strong , unemployment is low , inflation is under control and the public budget shows a surplus . consumer confidence in denmark last month hit its highest level since the national statistics agency began measuring the indicator 30 years ago , and , according to a recent gallup poll , three out of four danes feel their financial situation today is " good " or " very good . " " this heightened consumer confidence makes it even more difficult , or rather impossible , for the -lrb- opposition -rrb- social democrats to beat the government when it comes to the economy , " hans joergen nielsen , a political scientist at copenhagen university , told afp . as a sign of the strong morale in the scandinavian country , danes are the " happiest people in the world , " a study of 90 countries recently showed . early elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polls say denmark 's 4 million voters favor rasmussen over lykketoft in view of the favorable conditions , rasmussen decided to call elections nine months before the legislative period was set to end .
a market liberal in power since 2001 , rasmussen has vowed to maintain the strict immigration regulations , not raise taxes and create 60,000 new jobs by 2010 .
on sunday , justice minister lene esperson said the government , if re-elected , would expel young immigrant recidivists for life . " we have to act when faced with this particular group of young criminal foreigners who are completely indifferent to everything and who lack respect for existing sanctions , " esperson said . meanwhile , the social democrats , who suffered their worst election results in 28 years when they lost power in 2001 , could hit new low this time , some polls suggest .
with a content electorate , the opposition has little to offer voters , observers say . " the liberal party has succeeded in stealing many of the social democrats ' traditional weapons , portraying itself as the defender of the less privileged , of families with children , pensioners and the public sector , " copenhagen university political scientist lars bille told afp .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .

german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright . a night on the town in germany typically means the next day is spent at the laundromat .
the fog of cigarette and cigar smoke in restaurants and bars may be disappearing in european countries like ireland , norway and , as of jan .
10 , italy .
but germany continues to be among the more smoker-friendly countries on the continent , with restaurants slow to introduce non-smoking zones and bar visitors regularly greeted with great clouds of nicotine and carbon-dioxide upon opening the front door .
" the fact that germany is not on the vanguard as far as protecting smokers is obvious , " said marlies volkmer , a member of the german parliament 's health committee . bigger non-smoking zones in restaurants together with her colleagues , volkmer wants the government to take a harder line on public buildings and restaurants that still do not separate smoking and non-smoking areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany gets bad grades when it comes to anti-smoking measures germany 's chief gastronomic association is currently negotiating a deal with the health ministry that would call for 40 percent of a restaurant 's dining space to be devoted to non-smokers .
volkmer says that 's far too little .
" we have the duty to protect non-smokers and restaurant visitors , " she recently told der spiegel magazine . there is nothing to indicate that germany will go as far as italy and ireland .
indeed , though non-smoking protection is often a topic of debate within the country , germany has moved ploddingly towards any real reform . despite tax hikes on cigarette packs in the past three years and a vocal commitment to change , the european network of smoking and prevention gave the country bad grades when it came to anti-smoking policies .
the report , released last fall , ranked germany in the bottom ten in europe , out of 28 countries . in addition to allowing smoking in restaurants and bars , germany permits smoking in public institutions . " that is really overdue , " said gerlinde kaupa , parliamentarian health expert of the christian democratic union .
" in public buildings , to which people ca n't avoid going , there is a duty to negotiate a deal . " playing the job card all the saber rattling on the parliamentary level regarding restaurants has been met with frustration by germany 's hotel and restaurant association .
director ingrid hartges says that bars and restaurants have already been dealing with declining sales over the past few years .
a ban " would be the final blow for many restaurants and bars , " she said in an interview . it is one of the most common arguments given by anti-ban advocates , and one that resonates in a country of slow economic growth rates where 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
in addition , hartges says that smoking bans work best when they are n't forced upon the industry .
in train stations , airports and other transit areas , for example , visitors have readily agreed to smoking areas . " this was reached without any sort of law , " she said .
" there is already a lot being done . " ban " not ruled out " surveys in ireland and new york , which have introduced smoking bans , tend to dispute the money-loss arguments put forward by restaurant owners . irish researchers found that while the number of non-smokers visiting bars and restaurants since the ban has slightly increased , the number of smokers at the pubs has remained relatively unchanged .
in addition , the restaurant association of ireland , one of the ban 's opponents , has come around to it and said recently that business has been virtually the same . " they had been predicting thousands of jobs lost , and that it would be so detrimental to the economy , " said valerie coughlan , of the anti-smoking organization ash ireland in an interview .
" but none of the predictions came true . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ross heffernan , a barman at kehoe 's lounge bar in dublin , stacks ashtrays no longer needed following the ban in irish pubs last march germany wants to start small , with the division of smoking and non-smoking areas in restaurants .
but kaupa said she is not against outright bans in the near future .
" i see this as a first step , " she said of the agreement , which is expected to be reached in early march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.02.2005 weak dollar unnerves german car giants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : profits on cars made in germany and sold in the us could be slashed german auto manufacturers are facing the prospect of having their us profits from imported models slashed due to the weak performance of the dollar .
for many , this is just more bad news in an industry on edge . german car manufacturers are facing a tough time in the united states as the weak performance of the dollar against the euro threatens to undermine any profits companies like mercedes-benz , bmw and porsche make over the atlantic . the european single currency rose from around $ 1.20 in september to an all-time high of $ 1.3667 at the end of december over concerns about the increasing us trade and budget deficits .
the euro has since been trading around $ 1.30 , but many analysts say it could hit $ 1.40 this year . us exports have benefited from the weak dollar , making them less expensive for overseas customers but has the opposite effect on euro-zone goods , making them more expensive in the united states , the biggest auto market in the world , or eating into manufacturers ' profit margins as they try to keep prices steady . analysts at the german westlb bank have estimated that effect of the currency rate as it is as at the moment could detrimentally effect bmw 's north american business to the tune of € 886 million -lrb- $ 1.13 billion -rrb- .
mercedes ' profits are likely to be hit even harder with losses in business nearer € 933 million for this year , although projected sales for sister company chrysler and the company 's commercial vehicle range in the us may go some way to reduce this estimated loss . mercedes delays b-class launch in us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside the delayed b-class mercedes .
such are the jitters running through germany 's auto giants that mercedes announced on monday that its parent company daimlerchrysler ag is delaying the us launch of its mercedes-benz b-class sport wagon over the exchange rate concerns with fears that the weak dollar would eat too deeply into profits . the north america launch for the compact four-door hatchback was expected later this year but daimlerchrysler have now put the brakes on its release , just a week after it was presented the car at the north american international auto show in detroit . " given the current dollar-to-euro relationship , the launch is being delayed for now , " spokesperson toni melfi told reporters . melfi declined to say when the launch would take place , but stressed that the exchange rate has to be " substantially better . "
the b-class , however , will be brought out in canada and mexico as planned . figures estimated to show another huge loss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed launch of the b-class is seen as more bad news for mercedes , suggesting that the stuttgart -based carmaker is uncertain about the small wagon 's prospects in the us market .
mercedes is also in the middle of a damaging earnings slump and is due to release less than favorable fourth-quarter and 2004 results on thursday .
experts believe that daimlerchrysler 's top brand is facing a profit loss of some € 2.7 billion for the year , following on from the € 3.1 billion loss recorded in 2003 . the exchange rate situation is unlikely to get any better for the german car makers in the foreseeable future .
the german automobile federation has cautioned manufacturers to avoid any quick-fix solutions and prepare themselves for an industry environment with a permanently weak dollar . " it looks as though the us exchange policy follows the motto : our currency - your problem , " vda president bernd gottschalk recently lamented . hedging on us production increase both mercedes and volkswagen have announced increased production of vehicles at plants in the united states in the hope that sales of vehicles built in the us will help fill the gaps in the profits of imported models .
daimler will double its production of the six-seater r-class at its plant in alabama , traditionally the transatlantic birthplace of the m-class , and add the new g-class to the plant 's roster in the future . vw intends to increase the production of the bora and fox hatchback in its plants in mexico and brazil in an attempt to make ground on an estimated € 1 billion loss penciled in for 2004 .
bmw , however , has no plans to expand production of its x5 suv and z4 sports car at its assembly plant in spartanburg , south carolina . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers pin us hopes on new models as the north american international auto show gets underway in detroit this week , german carmakers are hoping new models will increase their market share in america despite the strong euro .

a controversial comic book depicting jesus as a party animal is not amusing the greeks .
they have banned the book and sentenced its author to a six-month jail term . calling it " hurtful to public decency and blasphemous , " an athens court upheld a ban on a comic book portraying jesus christ as a naked surfer high on marijuana and sentenced its author to six months in jail last month .
the book 's greek publishers and four local booksellers were acquitted of all charges regarding the book , called " the life of jesus . "
a separate case on the book 's seizure is pending in the greek supreme court .
" if the ban is not lifted , we 'll consider appealing to the european court of human rights , " said haderer 's lawyer , minas mihailovic .
ruling is " scandalous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another view of jesus austrian author gerhard haderer did not attend the trial and faces imprisonment only if he enters greece .
he called the ruling " scandalous . "
" i have done nothing other than to go too far in depicting the contrast between non-believers and believers , " he said .
" but when the state suddenly begins to set limits for humor , then that is really a reason for disquiet . "
haderer 's book , which sold over 100,000 german-language copies , is reportedly the first one to be banned in greece in more than 20 years .
it first ran into trouble in february 2003 after the greek edition was confiscated by the greek government and the powerful and conservative greek orthodox church filed a complaint against the author .
in 2000 , another book , an erotic greek novel was provisionally seized in greece after the church condemned it as blasphemous .
jesus on a surfing trip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surfing jesus the book is controversial because of its out-of-the-ordinary depictions of jesus , such as one of his crossing the sea of galilee naked on a surfboard , receiving divine inspiration from frankincense .
one illustration recasts the last supper as a drinking binge .
characters such as fashion designer karl lagerfeld and the late guitar wonder jimi hendrix mingle with jesus in the tales .
the book has been published in austria , germany , france , portugal , the czech republic , hungary and south korea .
in some countries , it has sparked protests and a czech lawmaker wanted the author fined .
but in no other country has the book been banned .
" after all , greece is a member of the european union and , so you would think , not a religious state in which an artist 's freedom of expression is kicked to the ground , " said harderer 's publisher , fritz panzer .
blasphemy laws hinder artistic freedom the crackdown on the book was condemned by the geneva-based international publishers ' association -lrb- ipa -rrb- because of concerns that the ruling will hinder other authors .
bildunterschrift : gerhard haderer poses in front of one of his comics " while ipa opposes all forms of religious intolerance , it stands for the elimination of all prohibitions limiting freedom of expression whether imposed by governments or by religious authorities , " ipa officials wrote in a statement . vivian papanayotou -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " the passion " stirs heated debate in germany the controversial biblical film epic the passion of the christ opens in germany this week .

" people are also advised to remove any valuables from their homes whilst they are uninhabited . "
andy baines , community safety sergeant , of the crime and disorder reduction partnership , said : " we believe this initiative will provide additional peace of mind for those people whose homes and businesses have been affected by the flooding .

bbc wales week in week out programme reveal that anorexia sufferers are being sent messages and images urging them to continue starving .
youngsters are encouraged to celebrate anorexia as a lifestyle , not a disease .
there are thought to be hundreds of " pro-ana " websites glamorise thinness and give tips on deceiving doctors .
the sites are being blamed for undermining the recovery attempts of extremely vulnerable sufferers .
you can see a picture of someone else that 's died from something that you are doing , and it 's not enough to stop you anorexia sufferer kirsty ball kirsty ball , from chepstow , south wales , is 18 but weighs just over five stone .
she is convinced she should continue losing weight .
she has suffered from anorexia nervosa for almost seven years .
a severe mental illness , it has devastating physical symptoms .
kirsty has an illogical compulsion to starve herself and to vomit what little she does eat .
" i get scared of not being able to count every rib or feel my hips protruding , " she said .
" you lose all perception of what a normal body is . "
despite the help of doctors and psychiatrists , kirsty is still in the grip of the disease .
after years of trying and failing to recover , she turned to the internet for support .
she found an online community of fellow sufferers who shared their harrowing experiences in chat rooms .
" it was a relief that i was n't alone - that there were other people that thought like me , " she explained .
i hate the way it makes me feel , all dirty an anorexic 's website posting but , like so many others who set out in search of comfort , kirsty quickly fell prey to " pro-ana " chat rooms and websites .
she soon came to depend on them and describes in bbc wales ' week in week out programme how she would turn to faceless strangers online for encouragement whenever she wanted to lose more weight .
disturbing photographs and messages from other emaciated sufferers only served to spur her on .
" you can see a picture of someone else that 's died from something that you are doing , and it 's not enough to stop you , " she said .
dangerously underweight eating disorders affect up to 60,000 people in wales and experts are warning that many doctors are not spotting the symptoms early enough .
the eating disorders association is highlighting its concerns in a week-long campaign .
week in week out examines the devastating impact the " pro-ana " movement is having via the internet .
the programme tracks down a 16-year-old anorexic girl from rural wales whose harrowing online diary reveals her suffering .
she writes : " i hate the way it makes me feel , all dirty .
i hate it when i can feel it wriggling about inside me like a parasite destroying me . "
like kirsty , she searched the net for support and understanding but fell under the influence of chat rooms - where strangers encouraged her to become dangerously underweight .
week in week out , bbc one wales , 2235 gmt on tuesday , and again on bbc 2w at 2100 gmt on wednesday .

more than 97 % of accident and emergency patients are now discharged or admitted within four hours .

immigration minister , des browne , said the home secretary 's announcement on immigration would recognise the special needs of scotland .
new controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols were unveiled by charles clarke on monday .
under his plans only skilled workers will be allowed to stay in the uk .
the waiting period to settle here will also increase from four to five years with a points system introduced to make it easier for highly skilled immigrants to work in this country .
falling population first minister jack mcconnell welcomed the immigration proposals saying the plans recognised that scotland had to meet the challenge of depopulation .
he added that the immigration and the asylum system must be the responsibility of the british government .
mr mcconnell insisted : " the proposals put us in a stronger position to attract fresh talent to scotland . "
mr mcconnell wants to tackle the dwindling population reports had suggested the home office would water down mr mcconnell 's plan .
it is aimed at boosting scotland 's dwindling population by attracting 8,000 new people annually to scotland by 2009 .
experts predict the number of people north of the border will fall below five million .
allegations had been made that david blunkett , then home secretary , consistently vetoed mr mcconnell 's ideas for encouraging highly-skilled foreigners to live and work in scotland .
but mr browne , labour mp for kilmarnock and loudoun , insisted : " the stuff in the paper yesterday was paperwork that showed the development of policy .
that sort of thing happens all the time . "
he added : " there are discussions between officials about the development of policy .
" and the fact of the matter is that the previous home secretary and jack mcconnell had a very strong relationship about this issue , and he has a very strong relationship with charles clarke as well about this issue and has met him to discuss it . "
the leader of the scottish national party , alex salmond , was not happy with mr clarke 's announcement in the house of commons .
he said what scotland needed was distinct policies to attract people to work and boost economic growth .
mr salmond mp , added : " it is time for scotland to tackle its population crisis itself and for power to be devolved to the scottish parliament . "

immigration minister , des browne , said the home secretary 's announcement on immigration would recognise the special needs of scotland .
new controls on economic migrants and tighter border patrols were unveiled by charles clarke on monday .
under his plans only skilled workers will be allowed to stay in the uk .
the waiting period to settle here will also increase from four to five years with a points system introduced to make it easier for highly skilled immigrants to work in this country .
falling population first minister jack mcconnell welcomed the immigration proposals saying the plans recognised that scotland had to meet the challenge of depopulation .
he added that the immigration and the asylum system must be the responsibility of the british government .
mr mcconnell insisted : " the proposals put us in a stronger position to attract fresh talent to scotland . "
mr mcconnell wants to tackle the dwindling population reports had suggested the home office would water down mr mcconnell 's plan .
it is aimed at boosting scotland 's dwindling population by attracting 8,000 new people annually to scotland by 2009 .
experts predict the number of people north of the border will fall below five million .
allegations had been made that david blunkett , then home secretary , consistently vetoed mr mcconnell 's ideas for encouraging highly-skilled foreigners to live and work in scotland .
but mr browne , labour mp for kilmarnock and loudoun , insisted : " the stuff in the paper yesterday was paperwork that showed the development of policy .
that sort of thing happens all the time . "
he added : " there are discussions between officials about the development of policy .
" and the fact of the matter is that the previous home secretary and jack mcconnell had a very strong relationship about this issue , and he has a very strong relationship with charles clarke as well about this issue and has met him to discuss it . "
the leader of the scottish national party , alex salmond , was not happy with mr clarke 's announcement in the house of commons .
he said what scotland needed was distinct policies to attract people to work and boost economic growth .
mr salmond mp , added : " it is time for scotland to tackle its population crisis itself and for power to be devolved to the scottish parliament . "

" the summit will help us build on our efforts to combat these types of crimes , helping businesses understand the risks and helping us to advise them on actions they themselves can take to make wales a safer place to live and work , " he said .
" in the battle against high-tech crime everyone has a responsibility to be alert , to know how to protect their technology and report incidents to the relevant authorities . "
the wda is keen to do all it can to help businesses in wales protect themselves and their customers .
patrick sullivan , its director of media technology programmes , said : " the vast benefits of computer technologies and broadband infrastructure mean that more and more welsh businesses are taking advantage of the internet , e-commerce , and enhancing the efficiency of day-to-day operations . "
but , he warned : " high-tech crimes can have a potentially serious impact and therefore it 's essential that welsh businesses are fully aware of the threats and how they can protect themselves by taking the appropriate security measures . "

the prosecution team could have demanded that muslim cleric abu bakar ba 'asyir be executed if found guilty .
ba 'asyir denies leading the jemaah islamiah group , which is thought to be linked to al-qaeda .
he also denies any involvement in bomb attacks on bali nightclubs in 2002 and the marriott hotel in jakarta in 2003 .
the bali attacks killed 202 people , while 12 died - including a suicide bomber - when the marriot was attacked .
charges against ba 'asyir under anti-terror law : conspiring , planning and inciting acts of terrorism -lrb- e.g. marriott attacks -rrb- using position to influence / persuade others withholding information under criminal code : accessory to bali attacks militant cleric 's legal saga profile : abu bakar ba 'asyir " the defendant is proven guilty of carrying out terror acts as stipulated in the law ... and proven guilty of causing the fires -lsb- in bali -rsb- which caused the deaths , " prosecutor salman maryadi told the jakarta court on tuesday .
although he may not have been at the scene of the bombings , the 66-year old cleric was aware of the plans and did nothing to stop them being carried out , the prosecution alleged .
ba 'asyir did not react to the accusations , but his supporters cried out : " the prosecutors are cruel " .
the defence has still to present its case in the trial , which began in october .
under indonesian law , judges can ignore a prosecutors ' demand when it comes to sentencing .
' spiritual leader ' ba 'asyir says he has been brought to trial because of western pressure on the indonesian government .
he has been tried before , but was acquitted because of a lack of evidence proving he was the leader of jemaah islamiah .
he was , however , jailed for 18 months for immigration violations .
the prosecution 's case rests on the assertion that ba 'asyir is or was the spiritual leader of those who carried out militant attacks such as that at bali .
scores of people - mainly western tourists , but also a large number of indonesians - were killed in kuta , bali , on the early morning of 12 october 2002 , in blasts targeting popular nightclubs .
in relation to the bali attack the cleric can not be charged retroactively under indonesian anti-terrorism laws , so is being tried under the country 's criminal code .

ofcom outlined a set of three proposals for the future of s4c as part of a two-month-long consultation period .
the ofcom review has been prompted by the new age of digital television .
it examines how public service broadcasting can survive in the world of multi-channel television .

it recommends that much more of itv 's network programmes - 50 % - must be produced outside london .

the situation in wales , scotland and northern ireland is considered to be substantially different to the english regions .
the minimum non-news requirement in england will be reduced from three to 1.5 hours per week .

there are three options regarding s4c , with a competitive tender model ofcom 's preferred option .
the first option is keeping things pretty much as they are , although there would be a review of certain aspects of the relationship between s4c and the bbc .
ofcom would like " greater transparency " in the relationship , including a possible review of both the financial arrangements and the current agreement for the bbc to supply 10 hours of programmes a week ..
the second - and the option least favoured by ofcom - is bringing s4c under the wing of the bbc .
a third option is that the s4c authority could remain in place but with a competitive tendering model for the provision of welsh-language services .
however , this is the start of the debate on the provision of welsh-language services , with the final proposals on the future of s4c expected in may or june .
