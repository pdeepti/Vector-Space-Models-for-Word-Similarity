dw 's wolter von tiesenhausen looks at köhler 's first year in office . when he was elected to office last year köhler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country 's head of state .
it 's a promise he 's kept by speaking the truth - even when many may not want to hear it .
in the last 12 months , köhler , who headed up the international monetary fund before returning to germany last year , has not steered clear of controversy .
in fact he 's rubbed salt into many of germany 's open wounds by criticizing the german trait of not risking or changing anything and happily taking advantage of social services they do not need .
president decides on new elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler has promised to remain independent of german chanceller gerhard schröder most recently , he promised not to be influenced by german chancellor gerhard schröder 's wish for early elections .
now that the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has followed schröder 's wish of a negative vote of confidence , it will be up to president köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament .
it would go against the many efforts köhler has made for change in germany not to approve the request from all of the country 's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time .
on the other hand , he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it 's the right thing to do - meaning the election guessing game 's next round will now begin .
the business-friendly president ?
elected by germany 's conservative opposition , union leaders see köhler to be too business-friendly but do not take into account the scathing remarks he has had for acquisitive businesses that have often shown a lack of corporate responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : upon his election , köhler promised not to promote anyone else 's agenda if köhler has been unable to remain neutral when it comes to berlin 's political wrangling , then it certainly has n't hurt the public 's view of him .
that does n't come as much of a surprise as his job affords him a high profile and limited authority : he 's still near the top of public popularity polls , a position envied by just about every other german politician .
even with his limited powers , horst köhler has shown himself to be more than just a yes man who puts his stamp on everything that gets thrown his way .
he has remained an influential figure with trips around the globe and continues to work to push germany forward on the world stage - work he will most likely continue regardless of who sits in the chancellor 's seat this fall . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " the german parliament is expected to pass a no-confidence vote against chancellor gerhard schröder at his request friday in a move aimed at triggering early elections this autumn .
-lrb- july 1 , 2005 -rrb- köhler halts ratification of eu constitution german president horst köhler on wednesday decided to halt his country 's ratification of the eu constitution as germany 's highest court is still reviewing an appeal against the treaty 's approval .
-lrb- june 15 , 2005 -rrb- köhler elected german president horst köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , was elected germany 's new president on sunday .
he said he wanted to use the ceremonial post to make the country a " land of ideas . "
-lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- feedback should köhler base his decision to dissolve parliament on what germany 's political parties want or on his own opinions ?

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .
green parliamentarian werner schulz has already announced his intention to turn to the court if parliament is dissolved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 vw faces bribery scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his resignation is already raising eyebrows : klaus volkert the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate . in a surprise move , the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen , klaus volkert , announced thursday he is stepping down . volkert , head of one of germany 's most powerful works councils , told the assembled workers he was resigning due to reasons of age and that he would be succeeded by his deputy , bernd osterloh as early as friday , the employees said . nevertheless , industry sources said that volkert , 62 , was leaving his post in connection with a brivery scandal at vw 's skoda unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many people had to be bribed before this skoda car could reach the assembly line ?
volkert was sent packing due to " irregularities " in connection with an alleged bribery scandal surrounding skoda 's former head of personnel , helmut schuster , the sources said , confirming a corresponding report in the online version of the weekly magazine der spiegel . volkert has been head of vw 's general works council since 1990 and also sits on the car maker 's supervisory board .
in the 1990s , he was involved in the introduction of the four-day week in vw and the " 5000 x 5000 " model .
rumors of his close ties with the management made him unpopular among some of the employees . resignation under pressure ? the vw general works council announced thursday night that volkert was " aware of the expected public discussions about the apparent irregularities that were connected to him . " volkert himself denied being involved in criminal activities . but the head of the powerful ig metall labor union , jürgen peters , said that volkert had been thinking of stepping down early for some time . der spiegel reported that internal auditors at vw were looking into allegations that volkert and schuster were involved in a company that had been bidding to win a contract from skoda . schuster , who quit earlier this month , is already being investigated by prosecutors on allegations he received bribes from potential suppliers . vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder promised a close investigation of the allegations against other vw employees and full cooperation with the judiciary . tip of the iceberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the vokswagen reputation be tarnished because of the bribery scandal ?
the german economic magazine wirtschaftwoche , citing well-informed circles , claims that the skoda bribery scandal has much wider implications and that volkert 's resignation is by no means the end of the affair . the magazine claims that certain politicians , including former minister president of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , and german chancellor gerhard schröder , were aware of the wrongdoings in vw 's skoda unit . both politicians rejected the claims as unfounded . " this is a wrong , defamatory allegation , " said bela anda , a government spokesperson .

new rules mean accounts will be taxed . from july 1 , banks in switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - will begin taxing the savings accounts of eu residents on behalf of their governments , implementing an accord that bern and brussels reached after years of painstaking talks . " this is the first time in the world that banks have agreed to levy a tax on behalf of a foreign country , " said a spokesman of the swiss bankers association . the accord is meant to crack down on tax-dodgers who take advantage of swiss banking secrecy laws and is tied to a tightening of rules within the 25-member eu under a new directive on savings taxation . rather than automatically revealing the identity of the account-holder , banks in non-eu switzerland will initially levy a 15 percent withholding tax on the interest eu citizens earn on their savings . the rate will rise to 20 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 . swiss banks will keep a quarter of the levy to cover their costs , and hand over the rest to the saver 's home country . keeping secrets in exchange for agreeing to play tax collector for the eu , switzerland was able to protect its cherished system of banking secrecy , which has helped make the reputation of the country 's financial sector for critics and supporters alike and fuel the country 's prosperity . there are no official statistics for the number of swiss bank accounts belonging to eu residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : total funds managed by swiss banks in 2004 were around 3.55 trillion swiss francs -lrb- 2.29 trillion euros , $ 2.77 trillion -rrb- - an estimated one-third of global private assets . the country 's banks say they have spent 300 million swiss francs on setting up the computer systems needed to levy the eu tax . eu clients can alternatively authorize the banks to hand over their details to tax authorities in their home country , which can then calculate the exact sum they should pay . skirting the rules but even though the swiss-eu accord is meant to cut tax evasion , it has several loopholes . the withholding tax can be avoided by shaking up one 's portfolio .
the deal does not cover dividends , insurance products , capital gains or derivatives .
it only applies to individuals , not businesses , so wealthy customers can create a company in switzerland to mask their savings . germany 's finance minister hans eichel was one of the biggest supporters of the accord with the swiss , aiming to boost tax revenues at home by taxing the savings many germans are said to hide in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to swiss banks , the withholding tax will inject less than expected into eu nations ' coffers - and certainly not the hundred of millions of euros that eu governments have been hoping . publicly , swiss banks say they do not fear that customers will head to other financial centers where authorities have more inroads into bank accounts . foreign savers appreciate not only banking secrecy , but also the efficiency of swiss banks and the country 's political stability , bankers say here .
however , swiss banks have also made strategic moves to ensure they do not lose out , spreading operations to financial centers which are not included in the deal with the eu , such as singapore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite as impenetrable as they once were several large swiss banks have opened offices in asia in recent years , to " recapture " money previously held in switzerland and attract the region 's increasingly wealthy savers . the new tax rules also apply to eu members ' dependencies - such as britain 's jersey and guernsey - plus monaco , liechtenstein , san marino and andorra , which have also placed a premium on discretion . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

new rules mean accounts will be taxed . from july 1 , banks in switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - will begin taxing the savings accounts of eu residents on behalf of their governments , implementing an accord that bern and brussels reached after years of painstaking talks . " this is the first time in the world that banks have agreed to levy a tax on behalf of a foreign country , " said a spokesman of the swiss bankers association . the accord is meant to crack down on tax-dodgers who take advantage of swiss banking secrecy laws and is tied to a tightening of rules within the 25-member eu under a new directive on savings taxation . rather than automatically revealing the identity of the account-holder , banks in non-eu switzerland will initially levy a 15 percent withholding tax on the interest eu citizens earn on their savings . the rate will rise to 20 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 . swiss banks will keep a quarter of the levy to cover their costs , and hand over the rest to the saver 's home country . keeping secrets in exchange for agreeing to play tax collector for the eu , switzerland was able to protect its cherished system of banking secrecy , which has helped make the reputation of the country 's financial sector for critics and supporters alike and fuel the country 's prosperity . there are no official statistics for the number of swiss bank accounts belonging to eu residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : total funds managed by swiss banks in 2004 were around 3.55 trillion swiss francs -lrb- 2.29 trillion euros , $ 2.77 trillion -rrb- - an estimated one-third of global private assets . the country 's banks say they have spent 300 million swiss francs on setting up the computer systems needed to levy the eu tax . eu clients can alternatively authorize the banks to hand over their details to tax authorities in their home country , which can then calculate the exact sum they should pay . skirting the rules but even though the swiss-eu accord is meant to cut tax evasion , it has several loopholes . the withholding tax can be avoided by shaking up one 's portfolio .
the deal does not cover dividends , insurance products , capital gains or derivatives .
it only applies to individuals , not businesses , so wealthy customers can create a company in switzerland to mask their savings . germany 's finance minister hans eichel was one of the biggest supporters of the accord with the swiss , aiming to boost tax revenues at home by taxing the savings many germans are said to hide in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to swiss banks , the withholding tax will inject less than expected into eu nations ' coffers - and certainly not the hundred of millions of euros that eu governments have been hoping . publicly , swiss banks say they do not fear that customers will head to other financial centers where authorities have more inroads into bank accounts . foreign savers appreciate not only banking secrecy , but also the efficiency of swiss banks and the country 's political stability , bankers say here .
however , swiss banks have also made strategic moves to ensure they do not lose out , spreading operations to financial centers which are not included in the deal with the eu , such as singapore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite as impenetrable as they once were several large swiss banks have opened offices in asia in recent years , to " recapture " money previously held in switzerland and attract the region 's increasingly wealthy savers . the new tax rules also apply to eu members ' dependencies - such as britain 's jersey and guernsey - plus monaco , liechtenstein , san marino and andorra , which have also placed a premium on discretion . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 what next for schröder 's government ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's made his move , now it 's the president 's turn when the german parliament defeated the confidence vote brought by chancellor gerhard schröder on friday , it set in motion a procedure designed to end in a general election in the fall . schröder had wanted the vote to be defeated in order to trigger new elections 12 months ahead of schedule and had instructed members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to abstain in the vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament . the tactic worked - 296 voted against the measure and 148 abstained out of a total of 595 votes .
the ' yes ' votes tallied 151 . the procedure which leads to new elections is based on article 68 of the german basic law , which says : " if a vote of confidence brought by the federal chancellor is not approved by a majority of the members of the bundestag , the president of the federal republic can , at the request of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within 21 days . " president 's decision president horst köhler therefore has until july 22 to officially recognize the lack of a majority and dissolve the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler has not yet revealed what his intentions are , saying only that he would study the situation after the vote . if the bundestag is dissolved , köhler must call an election to take place within 60 days .
however the election can only take place on a holiday or a sunday . the election can not take place during the school summer holidays , which vary according to the regional states - in bavaria for example they do not end until september 12 . most observers agree that the date of september 18 is the most likely for an election . however the decision is far from certain . some of the smaller political parties and a handful of coalition deputies have vowed to mount a federal court challenge against bringing the poll forward . precedents there are two precedents for the confidence vote in the history of the german federal republic . in 1972 , chancellor willy brandt lost a confidence vote he called in the face of a highly divided parliament .
he went on to gain a comfortable majority in the ensuing general election . in 1983 , chancellor helmut kohl called a confidence vote after coming to power the previous year following the resignation of former chancellor helmut schmidt . kohl lost the confidence vote and won the subsequent election . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder loses confidence vote with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .
still , sooner or later there has to be an agreement about the eu 's 2007 - 2013 budget , including the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies , which are as dear to france as the rebate is to the uk .

speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "
in his speech before the european parliament , blair however rejected that accusation , saying he believed in the european project . " i must note that blair made it obvious that he is for a political union , " schröder said .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

those days are over and germany is cautious about what the british eu presidency that starts friday will entail . they both wanted the " third way , " a mixture of social democratic principles with a health dash of more liberal economic policies .

" this is the first time in the world that banks have agreed to levy a tax on behalf of a foreign country , " said a spokesman of the swiss bankers association . the accord is meant to crack down on tax-dodgers who take advantage of swiss banking secrecy laws and is tied to a tightening of rules within the 25-member eu under a new directive on savings taxation . rather than automatically revealing the identity of the account-holder , banks in non-eu switzerland will initially levy a 15 percent withholding tax on the interest eu citizens earn on their savings . the rate will rise to 20 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 . swiss banks will keep a quarter of the levy to cover their costs , and hand over the rest to the saver 's home country . keeping secrets in exchange for agreeing to play tax collector for the eu , switzerland was able to protect its cherished system of banking secrecy , which has helped make the reputation of the country 's financial sector for critics and supporters alike and fuel the country 's prosperity . there are no official statistics for the number of swiss bank accounts belonging to eu residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : total funds managed by swiss banks in 2004 were around 3.55 trillion swiss francs -lrb- 2.29 trillion euros , $ 2.77 trillion -rrb- - an estimated one-third of global private assets . the country 's banks say they have spent 300 million swiss francs on setting up the computer systems needed to levy the eu tax . eu clients can alternatively authorize the banks to hand over their details to tax authorities in their home country , which can then calculate the exact sum they should pay . skirting the rules but even though the swiss-eu accord is meant to cut tax evasion , it has several loopholes . the withholding tax can be avoided by shaking up one 's portfolio .
the deal does not cover dividends , insurance products , capital gains or derivatives .
it only applies to individuals , not businesses , so wealthy customers can create a company in switzerland to mask their savings . germany 's finance minister hans eichel was one of the biggest supporters of the accord with the swiss , aiming to boost tax revenues at home by taxing the savings many germans are said to hide in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to swiss banks , the withholding tax will inject less than expected into eu nations ' coffers - and certainly not the hundred of millions of euros that eu governments have been hoping . publicly , swiss banks say they do not fear that customers will head to other financial centers where authorities have more inroads into bank accounts . foreign savers appreciate not only banking secrecy , but also the efficiency of swiss banks and the country 's political stability , bankers say here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2005 blair launches presidency with informal summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is an interesting moment to take on the eu presidency " britain began its six-month presidency of the european union friday with prime minister tony blair pledging to hold an informal summit later this year to debate the future of the crisis-torn bloc . blair also promised to work hard to negotiate a deal on the thorny issue of financing and farm subsidies , during what will likely be a rocky half year at the helm of the restless 25-nation group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrosso and blair " the one thing everybody in europe will agree on is that this is an interesting moment to take on the presidency of the european union , " blair told a joint news conference with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " the general task is to try to initiate , in a cooperative and inclusive way , a debate about the future direction of europe , " he said , in remarks that saw him try to take the heat out of the disputes that are plaguing the bloc . a mid-way summit to discuss the future blair , who earlier held talks with barroso and other commissioners , said britain would host a summit of eu leaders mid-way through its presidency , which would also explore social reforms . " we have agreed that it would be sensible for the presidency to hold an informal summit in the autumn at which the leaders of europe would come together and discuss how europe makes progress in the future , how we give the energy and commitment to the european project , " blair said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france categorically rejected the constitution he said the european commission would draw up a paper on europe 's social model and how it functions in a world of globalization and that leaders would discuss it during the pause for reflection announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's constitution . but he categorically ruled out trying to change the treaty or better chart the troubled club 's future .
" i ca n't make progress on that in these six months , " he said . economic reform top priority in a working document for the next six months , london put economic reform at the top of its agenda , including reexamining the divisive issue of farm subsidies , which has propelled britain into a major battle with france . blair hopes to secure a deal on the 2007-2013 budget , but it remains unclear whether france in particular will be accommodating , given london 's steadfast refusal to part with its widely-detested but jealously-guarded budget rebate without an overhaul of the union 's long-term financing system . " we will do our best to make progress and to reach an agreement ; whether it is possible or not i really do n't know and neither does anyone at this stage , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders during crisis talks over the bloc 's finances earlier in june " it is important , obviously , that we try to reach an agreement , particularly after what happened at the previous summit of the european union , " he said , referring to a conclave two weeks ago that ended in failure , throwing the bloc into further strife after it ran into a crisis over its planned constitution . again trying to reach out to his partners , blair said : " i think there is less of a disagreement than people really make out . " for his part , barosso said he believed london 's presidency would be a " success " and threw his support behind blair 's agenda for reform to make europe more competitive with emerging giants such as china and india .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 vw faces bribery scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his resignation is already raising eyebrows : klaus volkert the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate . in a surprise move , the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen , klaus volkert , announced thursday he is stepping down . volkert , head of one of germany 's most powerful works councils , told the assembled workers he was resigning due to reasons of age and that he would be succeeded by his deputy , bernd osterloh as early as friday , the employees said . nevertheless , industry sources said that volkert , 62 , was leaving his post in connection with a brivery scandal at vw 's skoda unit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many people had to be bribed before this skoda car could reach the assembly line ?
volkert was sent packing due to " irregularities " in connection with an alleged bribery scandal surrounding skoda 's former head of personnel , helmut schuster , the sources said , confirming a corresponding report in the online version of the weekly magazine der spiegel . volkert has been head of vw 's general works council since 1990 and also sits on the car maker 's supervisory board .
in the 1990s , he was involved in the introduction of the four-day week in vw and the " 5000 x 5000 " model .
rumors of his close ties with the management made him unpopular among some of the employees . resignation under pressure ? the vw general works council announced thursday night that volkert was " aware of the expected public discussions about the apparent irregularities that were connected to him . " volkert himself denied being involved in criminal activities . but the head of the powerful ig metall labor union , jürgen peters , said that volkert had been thinking of stepping down early for some time . der spiegel reported that internal auditors at vw were looking into allegations that volkert and schuster were involved in a company that had been bidding to win a contract from skoda . schuster , who quit earlier this month , is already being investigated by prosecutors on allegations he received bribes from potential suppliers . vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder promised a close investigation of the allegations against other vw employees and full cooperation with the judiciary . tip of the iceberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the vokswagen reputation be tarnished because of the bribery scandal ?
the german economic magazine wirtschaftwoche , citing well-informed circles , claims that the skoda bribery scandal has much wider implications and that volkert 's resignation is by no means the end of the affair . the magazine claims that certain politicians , including former minister president of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , and german chancellor gerhard schröder , were aware of the wrongdoings in vw 's skoda unit . both politicians rejected the claims as unfounded .

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .
green parliamentarian werner schulz has already announced his intention to turn to the court if parliament is dissolved .
he said he was convinced that friday 's confidence vote was a farce .
interior minister otto schily defended the vote as constitutional , adding that schröder 's course of action was " courageous , fair and confident . "
deliberate defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder addressing parliamentarians on friday schröder orchestrated friday 's defeat to keep alive his strategy of holding early elections as soon as this september .
in his speech prior to the vote , he said he needed a fresh mandate if he was to continue with his controversial package of reforms known as agenda 2010 .

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .
green parliamentarian werner schulz has already announced his intention to turn to the court if parliament is dissolved .
he said he was convinced that friday 's confidence vote was a farce .
interior minister otto schily defended the vote as constitutional , adding that schröder 's course of action was " courageous , fair and confident . "
deliberate defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder addressing parliamentarians on friday schröder orchestrated friday 's defeat to keep alive his strategy of holding early elections as soon as this september .

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .
green parliamentarian werner schulz has already announced his intention to turn to the court if parliament is dissolved .
he said he was convinced that friday 's confidence vote was a farce .
interior minister otto schily defended the vote as constitutional , adding that schröder 's course of action was " courageous , fair and confident . "
deliberate defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder addressing parliamentarians on friday schröder orchestrated friday 's defeat to keep alive his strategy of holding early elections as soon as this september .
in his speech prior to the vote , he said he needed a fresh mandate if he was to continue with his controversial package of reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder demonstrated in his speech that there is enough justification to dissolve parliament , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" he cleverly included president köhler into the circle of those responsible by pointing out that new elections are very much the will of the people .
he put the pressure on köhler to approve it . "
according to pollsters , schröder is playing with fire .
an early run-off against the conservative candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , could see an end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
schröder 's party trails the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- heavily in opinion polls .

volkert was sent packing due to " irregularities " in connection with an alleged bribery scandal surrounding skoda 's former head of personnel , helmut schuster , the sources said , confirming a corresponding report in the online version of the weekly magazine der spiegel . volkert has been head of vw 's general works council since 1990 and also sits on the car maker 's supervisory board .
in the 1990s , he was involved in the introduction of the four-day week in vw and the " 5000 x 5000 " model .
rumors of his close ties with the management made him unpopular among some of the employees . resignation under pressure ? the vw general works council announced thursday night that volkert was " aware of the expected public discussions about the apparent irregularities that were connected to him . " volkert himself denied being involved in criminal activities . but the head of the powerful ig metall labor union , jürgen peters , said that volkert had been thinking of stepping down early for some time . der spiegel reported that internal auditors at vw were looking into allegations that volkert and schuster were involved in a company that had been bidding to win a contract from skoda . schuster , who quit earlier this month , is already being investigated by prosecutors on allegations he received bribes from potential suppliers . vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder promised a close investigation of the allegations against other vw employees and full cooperation with the judiciary . tip of the iceberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the vokswagen reputation be tarnished because of the bribery scandal ?
the german economic magazine wirtschaftwoche , citing well-informed circles , claims that the skoda bribery scandal has much wider implications and that volkert 's resignation is by no means the end of the affair . the magazine claims that certain politicians , including former minister president of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , and german chancellor gerhard schröder , were aware of the wrongdoings in vw 's skoda unit . both politicians rejected the claims as unfounded .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .

" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .

massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

those days are over and germany is cautious about what the british eu presidency that starts friday will entail . they both wanted the " third way , " a mixture of social democratic principles with a health dash of more liberal economic policies .
not extremely to the left , not way on the right , but somewhere closer to the middle . just after his election , schröder talked about closer cooperation with his british counterpart and in 1999 , the so-called schröder-blair paper was the result .
it was a manifest for a modern social democracy in these modern , globalized times . now that paper has disappeared , likely in some archivist 's drawer , and the two men are not only no longer on the same page , they are n't even on the same chapter .
that 's why in berlin , there is a good dose of scepticism as britain takes over the six-month rotating eu presidency , and attempts to impose its own stamp on the european project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schussel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels , thursday 16 june 2005 .
" i 'm sad " were the words from schröder after the failed eu summit in june .
but besides expressing his emotions , the german leader left no doubt about who he held responsible for the failure , the british prime minister .
whoever wants to destroy the eu due to national obstinacy or populist motives sins against future generations , schröder spewed in the mass-circulation bild newspaper shortly after the summit . no doubt he did n't name names , but it was clear who the message was for .
even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .
still , sooner or later there has to be an agreement about the eu 's 2007 - 2013 budget , including the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies , which are as dear to france as the rebate is to the uk . " if there is a compromise during the british presidency , and we can only hope there will be one , then it will have to be very close to that which -lsb- luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude -rsb- juncker proposed at the summit , " schröder said , referring to a last-minute offer by juncker that failed in the end .
" we can only hope . " differing visions schröder is no more excited about what he considers blair 's vision for the eu as he is about he considers the british leader 's budgetary obstinacy .
for schöder , the eu is not just a common market , it is a success social model that has slowly risen from the ruins of world war two . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses the european parliament in brussels , thursday june 23 , 2005 .
blair warned that the european union risks failure if it does not modernize and meet the needs of its citizens .
speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "
in his speech before the european parliament , blair however rejected that accusation , saying he believed in the european project . " i must note that blair made it obvious that he is for a political union , " schröder said .
" the expectation that goes along with that and which the presidency must work under , that will be the deciding factor . " the germans have another expectation of the british eu presidency .
despite the " no " votes during the referendums on the eu constitution in france and the netherlands , and the decision of eu leaders to take some time for reflection , the constitution should not be put on hold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " reflection for me does not mean retreat nor is it another word for doing nothing , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .

but at the same time , berlin says it is ready to take an active role in solving some of the eu 's pressing problems .
that 's likely the reason that despite the strong differences of opinion , schröder is keeping any personal criticism of blair to himself . " i have no intention of letting a serious , sensible discussion of facts degenerate into a personal controversy , " he said to reporters .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .

it was a manifest for a modern social democracy in these modern , globalized times . now that paper has disappeared , likely in some archivist 's drawer , and the two men are not only no longer on the same page , they are n't even on the same chapter .
that 's why in berlin , there is a good dose of scepticism as britain takes over the six-month rotating eu presidency , and attempts to impose its own stamp on the european project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schussel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels , thursday 16 june 2005 .
" i 'm sad " were the words from schröder after the failed eu summit in june .
but besides expressing his emotions , the german leader left no doubt about who he held responsible for the failure , the british prime minister .
whoever wants to destroy the eu due to national obstinacy or populist motives sins against future generations , schröder spewed in the mass-circulation bild newspaper shortly after the summit . no doubt he did n't name names , but it was clear who the message was for .
even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .
still , sooner or later there has to be an agreement about the eu 's 2007 - 2013 budget , including the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies , which are as dear to france as the rebate is to the uk . " if there is a compromise during the british presidency , and we can only hope there will be one , then it will have to be very close to that which -lsb- luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude -rsb- juncker proposed at the summit , " schröder said , referring to a last-minute offer by juncker that failed in the end .
" we can only hope . " differing visions schröder is no more excited about what he considers blair 's vision for the eu as he is about he considers the british leader 's budgetary obstinacy .

blair warned that the european union risks failure if it does not modernize and meet the needs of its citizens .
speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "
in his speech before the european parliament , blair however rejected that accusation , saying he believed in the european project . " i must note that blair made it obvious that he is for a political union , " schröder said .

those days are over and germany is cautious about what the british eu presidency that starts friday will entail . they both wanted the " third way , " a mixture of social democratic principles with a health dash of more liberal economic policies .
not extremely to the left , not way on the right , but somewhere closer to the middle . just after his election , schröder talked about closer cooperation with his british counterpart and in 1999 , the so-called schröder-blair paper was the result .
it was a manifest for a modern social democracy in these modern , globalized times . now that paper has disappeared , likely in some archivist 's drawer , and the two men are not only no longer on the same page , they are n't even on the same chapter .
that 's why in berlin , there is a good dose of scepticism as britain takes over the six-month rotating eu presidency , and attempts to impose its own stamp on the european project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schussel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels , thursday 16 june 2005 .
" i 'm sad " were the words from schröder after the failed eu summit in june .
but besides expressing his emotions , the german leader left no doubt about who he held responsible for the failure , the british prime minister .
whoever wants to destroy the eu due to national obstinacy or populist motives sins against future generations , schröder spewed in the mass-circulation bild newspaper shortly after the summit . no doubt he did n't name names , but it was clear who the message was for .
even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .
still , sooner or later there has to be an agreement about the eu 's 2007 - 2013 budget , including the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies , which are as dear to france as the rebate is to the uk . " if there is a compromise during the british presidency , and we can only hope there will be one , then it will have to be very close to that which -lsb- luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude -rsb- juncker proposed at the summit , " schröder said , referring to a last-minute offer by juncker that failed in the end .
" we can only hope . " differing visions schröder is no more excited about what he considers blair 's vision for the eu as he is about he considers the british leader 's budgetary obstinacy .

blair warned that the european union risks failure if it does not modernize and meet the needs of its citizens .
speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "
in his speech before the european parliament , blair however rejected that accusation , saying he believed in the european project . " i must note that blair made it obvious that he is for a political union , " schröder said .
" the expectation that goes along with that and which the presidency must work under , that will be the deciding factor . " the germans have another expectation of the british eu presidency .

but at the same time , berlin says it is ready to take an active role in solving some of the eu 's pressing problems .

new rules mean accounts will be taxed . from july 1 , banks in switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - will begin taxing the savings accounts of eu residents on behalf of their governments , implementing an accord that bern and brussels reached after years of painstaking talks . " this is the first time in the world that banks have agreed to levy a tax on behalf of a foreign country , " said a spokesman of the swiss bankers association . the accord is meant to crack down on tax-dodgers who take advantage of swiss banking secrecy laws and is tied to a tightening of rules within the 25-member eu under a new directive on savings taxation . rather than automatically revealing the identity of the account-holder , banks in non-eu switzerland will initially levy a 15 percent withholding tax on the interest eu citizens earn on their savings . the rate will rise to 20 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 . swiss banks will keep a quarter of the levy to cover their costs , and hand over the rest to the saver 's home country . keeping secrets in exchange for agreeing to play tax collector for the eu , switzerland was able to protect its cherished system of banking secrecy , which has helped make the reputation of the country 's financial sector for critics and supporters alike and fuel the country 's prosperity . there are no official statistics for the number of swiss bank accounts belonging to eu residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : total funds managed by swiss banks in 2004 were around 3.55 trillion swiss francs -lrb- 2.29 trillion euros , $ 2.77 trillion -rrb- - an estimated one-third of global private assets . the country 's banks say they have spent 300 million swiss francs on setting up the computer systems needed to levy the eu tax . eu clients can alternatively authorize the banks to hand over their details to tax authorities in their home country , which can then calculate the exact sum they should pay . skirting the rules but even though the swiss-eu accord is meant to cut tax evasion , it has several loopholes . the withholding tax can be avoided by shaking up one 's portfolio .
the deal does not cover dividends , insurance products , capital gains or derivatives .
it only applies to individuals , not businesses , so wealthy customers can create a company in switzerland to mask their savings . germany 's finance minister hans eichel was one of the biggest supporters of the accord with the swiss , aiming to boost tax revenues at home by taxing the savings many germans are said to hide in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to swiss banks , the withholding tax will inject less than expected into eu nations ' coffers - and certainly not the hundred of millions of euros that eu governments have been hoping . publicly , swiss banks say they do not fear that customers will head to other financial centers where authorities have more inroads into bank accounts . foreign savers appreciate not only banking secrecy , but also the efficiency of swiss banks and the country 's political stability , bankers say here .
however , swiss banks have also made strategic moves to ensure they do not lose out , spreading operations to financial centers which are not included in the deal with the eu , such as singapore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite as impenetrable as they once were several large swiss banks have opened offices in asia in recent years , to " recapture " money previously held in switzerland and attract the region 's increasingly wealthy savers . the new tax rules also apply to eu members ' dependencies - such as britain 's jersey and guernsey - plus monaco , liechtenstein , san marino and andorra , which have also placed a premium on discretion . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .

germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrosso and blair " the one thing everybody in europe will agree on is that this is an interesting moment to take on the presidency of the european union , " blair told a joint news conference with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " the general task is to try to initiate , in a cooperative and inclusive way , a debate about the future direction of europe , " he said , in remarks that saw him try to take the heat out of the disputes that are plaguing the bloc . a mid-way summit to discuss the future blair , who earlier held talks with barroso and other commissioners , said britain would host a summit of eu leaders mid-way through its presidency , which would also explore social reforms . " we have agreed that it would be sensible for the presidency to hold an informal summit in the autumn at which the leaders of europe would come together and discuss how europe makes progress in the future , how we give the energy and commitment to the european project , " blair said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france categorically rejected the constitution he said the european commission would draw up a paper on europe 's social model and how it functions in a world of globalization and that leaders would discuss it during the pause for reflection announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's constitution . but he categorically ruled out trying to change the treaty or better chart the troubled club 's future .
" i ca n't make progress on that in these six months , " he said . economic reform top priority in a working document for the next six months , london put economic reform at the top of its agenda , including reexamining the divisive issue of farm subsidies , which has propelled britain into a major battle with france . blair hopes to secure a deal on the 2007-2013 budget , but it remains unclear whether france in particular will be accommodating , given london 's steadfast refusal to part with its widely-detested but jealously-guarded budget rebate without an overhaul of the union 's long-term financing system . " we will do our best to make progress and to reach an agreement ; whether it is possible or not i really do n't know and neither does anyone at this stage , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders during crisis talks over the bloc 's finances earlier in june " it is important , obviously , that we try to reach an agreement , particularly after what happened at the previous summit of the european union , " he said , referring to a conclave two weeks ago that ended in failure , throwing the bloc into further strife after it ran into a crisis over its planned constitution . again trying to reach out to his partners , blair said : " i think there is less of a disagreement than people really make out . " for his part , barosso said he believed london 's presidency would be a " success " and threw his support behind blair 's agenda for reform to make europe more competitive with emerging giants such as china and india . " it 's a rough period for european politics and that is why this british presidency has a really very important responsibility . " turkey and security issues turning to other priorities in the coming months , blair highlighted future eu enlargement as well as stronger cooperation between member states on security issues such as terrorism , organised crime and illegal immigration .

new rules mean accounts will be taxed . from july 1 , banks in switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - will begin taxing the savings accounts of eu residents on behalf of their governments , implementing an accord that bern and brussels reached after years of painstaking talks . " this is the first time in the world that banks have agreed to levy a tax on behalf of a foreign country , " said a spokesman of the swiss bankers association . the accord is meant to crack down on tax-dodgers who take advantage of swiss banking secrecy laws and is tied to a tightening of rules within the 25-member eu under a new directive on savings taxation . rather than automatically revealing the identity of the account-holder , banks in non-eu switzerland will initially levy a 15 percent withholding tax on the interest eu citizens earn on their savings . the rate will rise to 20 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 . swiss banks will keep a quarter of the levy to cover their costs , and hand over the rest to the saver 's home country . keeping secrets in exchange for agreeing to play tax collector for the eu , switzerland was able to protect its cherished system of banking secrecy , which has helped make the reputation of the country 's financial sector for critics and supporters alike and fuel the country 's prosperity . there are no official statistics for the number of swiss bank accounts belonging to eu residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : total funds managed by swiss banks in 2004 were around 3.55 trillion swiss francs -lrb- 2.29 trillion euros , $ 2.77 trillion -rrb- - an estimated one-third of global private assets . the country 's banks say they have spent 300 million swiss francs on setting up the computer systems needed to levy the eu tax . eu clients can alternatively authorize the banks to hand over their details to tax authorities in their home country , which can then calculate the exact sum they should pay . skirting the rules but even though the swiss-eu accord is meant to cut tax evasion , it has several loopholes . the withholding tax can be avoided by shaking up one 's portfolio .

new rules mean accounts will be taxed . from july 1 , banks in switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - will begin taxing the savings accounts of eu residents on behalf of their governments , implementing an accord that bern and brussels reached after years of painstaking talks . " this is the first time in the world that banks have agreed to levy a tax on behalf of a foreign country , " said a spokesman of the swiss bankers association . the accord is meant to crack down on tax-dodgers who take advantage of swiss banking secrecy laws and is tied to a tightening of rules within the 25-member eu under a new directive on savings taxation . rather than automatically revealing the identity of the account-holder , banks in non-eu switzerland will initially levy a 15 percent withholding tax on the interest eu citizens earn on their savings . the rate will rise to 20 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 . swiss banks will keep a quarter of the levy to cover their costs , and hand over the rest to the saver 's home country . keeping secrets in exchange for agreeing to play tax collector for the eu , switzerland was able to protect its cherished system of banking secrecy , which has helped make the reputation of the country 's financial sector for critics and supporters alike and fuel the country 's prosperity . there are no official statistics for the number of swiss bank accounts belonging to eu residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : total funds managed by swiss banks in 2004 were around 3.55 trillion swiss francs -lrb- 2.29 trillion euros , $ 2.77 trillion -rrb- - an estimated one-third of global private assets . the country 's banks say they have spent 300 million swiss francs on setting up the computer systems needed to levy the eu tax . eu clients can alternatively authorize the banks to hand over their details to tax authorities in their home country , which can then calculate the exact sum they should pay . skirting the rules but even though the swiss-eu accord is meant to cut tax evasion , it has several loopholes . the withholding tax can be avoided by shaking up one 's portfolio .
the deal does not cover dividends , insurance products , capital gains or derivatives .
it only applies to individuals , not businesses , so wealthy customers can create a company in switzerland to mask their savings . germany 's finance minister hans eichel was one of the biggest supporters of the accord with the swiss , aiming to boost tax revenues at home by taxing the savings many germans are said to hide in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to swiss banks , the withholding tax will inject less than expected into eu nations ' coffers - and certainly not the hundred of millions of euros that eu governments have been hoping . publicly , swiss banks say they do not fear that customers will head to other financial centers where authorities have more inroads into bank accounts . foreign savers appreciate not only banking secrecy , but also the efficiency of swiss banks and the country 's political stability , bankers say here .
however , swiss banks have also made strategic moves to ensure they do not lose out , spreading operations to financial centers which are not included in the deal with the eu , such as singapore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite as impenetrable as they once were several large swiss banks have opened offices in asia in recent years , to " recapture " money previously held in switzerland and attract the region 's increasingly wealthy savers . the new tax rules also apply to eu members ' dependencies - such as britain 's jersey and guernsey - plus monaco , liechtenstein , san marino and andorra , which have also placed a premium on discretion . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

those days are over and germany is cautious about what the british eu presidency that starts friday will entail . they both wanted the " third way , " a mixture of social democratic principles with a health dash of more liberal economic policies .
not extremely to the left , not way on the right , but somewhere closer to the middle . just after his election , schröder talked about closer cooperation with his british counterpart and in 1999 , the so-called schröder-blair paper was the result .
it was a manifest for a modern social democracy in these modern , globalized times . now that paper has disappeared , likely in some archivist 's drawer , and the two men are not only no longer on the same page , they are n't even on the same chapter .
that 's why in berlin , there is a good dose of scepticism as britain takes over the six-month rotating eu presidency , and attempts to impose its own stamp on the european project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schussel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels , thursday 16 june 2005 .
" i 'm sad " were the words from schröder after the failed eu summit in june .
but besides expressing his emotions , the german leader left no doubt about who he held responsible for the failure , the british prime minister .
whoever wants to destroy the eu due to national obstinacy or populist motives sins against future generations , schröder spewed in the mass-circulation bild newspaper shortly after the summit . no doubt he did n't name names , but it was clear who the message was for .
even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .
still , sooner or later there has to be an agreement about the eu 's 2007 - 2013 budget , including the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies , which are as dear to france as the rebate is to the uk . " if there is a compromise during the british presidency , and we can only hope there will be one , then it will have to be very close to that which -lsb- luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude -rsb- juncker proposed at the summit , " schröder said , referring to a last-minute offer by juncker that failed in the end .
" we can only hope . " differing visions schröder is no more excited about what he considers blair 's vision for the eu as he is about he considers the british leader 's budgetary obstinacy .

blair warned that the european union risks failure if it does not modernize and meet the needs of its citizens .
speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "
in his speech before the european parliament , blair however rejected that accusation , saying he believed in the european project . " i must note that blair made it obvious that he is for a political union , " schröder said .
" the expectation that goes along with that and which the presidency must work under , that will be the deciding factor . " the germans have another expectation of the british eu presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 opinion : all eyes on germany 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler will decide whether germany faces early elections not from the political elite himself , german president horst köhler faces the politically charged decision of whether or not to dissolve parliament .
dw 's wolter von tiesenhausen looks at köhler 's first year in office . when he was elected to office last year köhler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country 's head of state .
it 's a promise he 's kept by speaking the truth - even when many may not want to hear it .
in the last 12 months , köhler , who headed up the international monetary fund before returning to germany last year , has not steered clear of controversy .
in fact he 's rubbed salt into many of germany 's open wounds by criticizing the german trait of not risking or changing anything and happily taking advantage of social services they do not need .
president decides on new elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler has promised to remain independent of german chanceller gerhard schröder most recently , he promised not to be influenced by german chancellor gerhard schröder 's wish for early elections .
now that the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has followed schröder 's wish of a negative vote of confidence , it will be up to president köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament .
it would go against the many efforts köhler has made for change in germany not to approve the request from all of the country 's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time .
on the other hand , he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it 's the right thing to do - meaning the election guessing game 's next round will now begin .
the business-friendly president ?

dw 's wolter von tiesenhausen looks at köhler 's first year in office . when he was elected to office last year köhler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country 's head of state .
it 's a promise he 's kept by speaking the truth - even when many may not want to hear it .
in the last 12 months , köhler , who headed up the international monetary fund before returning to germany last year , has not steered clear of controversy .

now that the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has followed schröder 's wish of a negative vote of confidence , it will be up to president köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament .
it would go against the many efforts köhler has made for change in germany not to approve the request from all of the country 's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time .
on the other hand , he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it 's the right thing to do - meaning the election guessing game 's next round will now begin .

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .
green parliamentarian werner schulz has already announced his intention to turn to the court if parliament is dissolved .
he said he was convinced that friday 's confidence vote was a farce .
interior minister otto schily defended the vote as constitutional , adding that schröder 's course of action was " courageous , fair and confident . "
deliberate defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder addressing parliamentarians on friday schröder orchestrated friday 's defeat to keep alive his strategy of holding early elections as soon as this september .
in his speech prior to the vote , he said he needed a fresh mandate if he was to continue with his controversial package of reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder demonstrated in his speech that there is enough justification to dissolve parliament , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" he cleverly included president köhler into the circle of those responsible by pointing out that new elections are very much the will of the people .
he put the pressure on köhler to approve it . "
according to pollsters , schröder is playing with fire .
an early run-off against the conservative candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , could see an end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
schröder 's party trails the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- heavily in opinion polls .

volkert was sent packing due to " irregularities " in connection with an alleged bribery scandal surrounding skoda 's former head of personnel , helmut schuster , the sources said , confirming a corresponding report in the online version of the weekly magazine der spiegel . volkert has been head of vw 's general works council since 1990 and also sits on the car maker 's supervisory board .
in the 1990s , he was involved in the introduction of the four-day week in vw and the " 5000 x 5000 " model .
rumors of his close ties with the management made him unpopular among some of the employees . resignation under pressure ? the vw general works council announced thursday night that volkert was " aware of the expected public discussions about the apparent irregularities that were connected to him . " volkert himself denied being involved in criminal activities . but the head of the powerful ig metall labor union , jürgen peters , said that volkert had been thinking of stepping down early for some time . der spiegel reported that internal auditors at vw were looking into allegations that volkert and schuster were involved in a company that had been bidding to win a contract from skoda . schuster , who quit earlier this month , is already being investigated by prosecutors on allegations he received bribes from potential suppliers . vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder promised a close investigation of the allegations against other vw employees and full cooperation with the judiciary . tip of the iceberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the vokswagen reputation be tarnished because of the bribery scandal ?
the german economic magazine wirtschaftwoche , citing well-informed circles , claims that the skoda bribery scandal has much wider implications and that volkert 's resignation is by no means the end of the affair . the magazine claims that certain politicians , including former minister president of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , and german chancellor gerhard schröder , were aware of the wrongdoings in vw 's skoda unit . both politicians rejected the claims as unfounded . " this is a wrong , defamatory allegation , " said bela anda , a government spokesperson .

the ' yes ' votes tallied 151 . the procedure which leads to new elections is based on article 68 of the german basic law , which says : " if a vote of confidence brought by the federal chancellor is not approved by a majority of the members of the bundestag , the president of the federal republic can , at the request of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within 21 days . " president 's decision president horst köhler therefore has until july 22 to officially recognize the lack of a majority and dissolve the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler has not yet revealed what his intentions are , saying only that he would study the situation after the vote . if the bundestag is dissolved , köhler must call an election to take place within 60 days .
however the election can only take place on a holiday or a sunday . the election can not take place during the school summer holidays , which vary according to the regional states - in bavaria for example they do not end until september 12 . most observers agree that the date of september 18 is the most likely for an election . however the decision is far from certain . some of the smaller political parties and a handful of coalition deputies have vowed to mount a federal court challenge against bringing the poll forward . precedents there are two precedents for the confidence vote in the history of the german federal republic . in 1972 , chancellor willy brandt lost a confidence vote he called in the face of a highly divided parliament .
he went on to gain a comfortable majority in the ensuing general election . in 1983 , chancellor helmut kohl called a confidence vote after coming to power the previous year following the resignation of former chancellor helmut schmidt . kohl lost the confidence vote and won the subsequent election . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder loses confidence vote with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrosso and blair " the one thing everybody in europe will agree on is that this is an interesting moment to take on the presidency of the european union , " blair told a joint news conference with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " the general task is to try to initiate , in a cooperative and inclusive way , a debate about the future direction of europe , " he said , in remarks that saw him try to take the heat out of the disputes that are plaguing the bloc . a mid-way summit to discuss the future blair , who earlier held talks with barroso and other commissioners , said britain would host a summit of eu leaders mid-way through its presidency , which would also explore social reforms . " we have agreed that it would be sensible for the presidency to hold an informal summit in the autumn at which the leaders of europe would come together and discuss how europe makes progress in the future , how we give the energy and commitment to the european project , " blair said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france categorically rejected the constitution he said the european commission would draw up a paper on europe 's social model and how it functions in a world of globalization and that leaders would discuss it during the pause for reflection announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's constitution . but he categorically ruled out trying to change the treaty or better chart the troubled club 's future .
" i ca n't make progress on that in these six months , " he said . economic reform top priority in a working document for the next six months , london put economic reform at the top of its agenda , including reexamining the divisive issue of farm subsidies , which has propelled britain into a major battle with france . blair hopes to secure a deal on the 2007-2013 budget , but it remains unclear whether france in particular will be accommodating , given london 's steadfast refusal to part with its widely-detested but jealously-guarded budget rebate without an overhaul of the union 's long-term financing system . " we will do our best to make progress and to reach an agreement ; whether it is possible or not i really do n't know and neither does anyone at this stage , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders during crisis talks over the bloc 's finances earlier in june " it is important , obviously , that we try to reach an agreement , particularly after what happened at the previous summit of the european union , " he said , referring to a conclave two weeks ago that ended in failure , throwing the bloc into further strife after it ran into a crisis over its planned constitution . again trying to reach out to his partners , blair said : " i think there is less of a disagreement than people really make out . " for his part , barosso said he believed london 's presidency would be a " success " and threw his support behind blair 's agenda for reform to make europe more competitive with emerging giants such as china and india . " it 's a rough period for european politics and that is why this british presidency has a really very important responsibility . " turkey and security issues turning to other priorities in the coming months , blair highlighted future eu enlargement as well as stronger cooperation between member states on security issues such as terrorism , organised crime and illegal immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2005 eu tax dodgers lose swiss haven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping money out of the taxman 's sight in switzerland is now harder the good old days are almost over for europeans who have stashed their cash in switzerland , out of sight of the tax authorities in their homeland .
new rules mean accounts will be taxed . from july 1 , banks in switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - will begin taxing the savings accounts of eu residents on behalf of their governments , implementing an accord that bern and brussels reached after years of painstaking talks . " this is the first time in the world that banks have agreed to levy a tax on behalf of a foreign country , " said a spokesman of the swiss bankers association . the accord is meant to crack down on tax-dodgers who take advantage of swiss banking secrecy laws and is tied to a tightening of rules within the 25-member eu under a new directive on savings taxation . rather than automatically revealing the identity of the account-holder , banks in non-eu switzerland will initially levy a 15 percent withholding tax on the interest eu citizens earn on their savings . the rate will rise to 20 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 . swiss banks will keep a quarter of the levy to cover their costs , and hand over the rest to the saver 's home country . keeping secrets in exchange for agreeing to play tax collector for the eu , switzerland was able to protect its cherished system of banking secrecy , which has helped make the reputation of the country 's financial sector for critics and supporters alike and fuel the country 's prosperity . there are no official statistics for the number of swiss bank accounts belonging to eu residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : total funds managed by swiss banks in 2004 were around 3.55 trillion swiss francs -lrb- 2.29 trillion euros , $ 2.77 trillion -rrb- - an estimated one-third of global private assets . the country 's banks say they have spent 300 million swiss francs on setting up the computer systems needed to levy the eu tax . eu clients can alternatively authorize the banks to hand over their details to tax authorities in their home country , which can then calculate the exact sum they should pay . skirting the rules but even though the swiss-eu accord is meant to cut tax evasion , it has several loopholes . the withholding tax can be avoided by shaking up one 's portfolio .
the deal does not cover dividends , insurance products , capital gains or derivatives .
it only applies to individuals , not businesses , so wealthy customers can create a company in switzerland to mask their savings . germany 's finance minister hans eichel was one of the biggest supporters of the accord with the swiss , aiming to boost tax revenues at home by taxing the savings many germans are said to hide in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to swiss banks , the withholding tax will inject less than expected into eu nations ' coffers - and certainly not the hundred of millions of euros that eu governments have been hoping . publicly , swiss banks say they do not fear that customers will head to other financial centers where authorities have more inroads into bank accounts . foreign savers appreciate not only banking secrecy , but also the efficiency of swiss banks and the country 's political stability , bankers say here .
however , swiss banks have also made strategic moves to ensure they do not lose out , spreading operations to financial centers which are not included in the deal with the eu , such as singapore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite as impenetrable as they once were several large swiss banks have opened offices in asia in recent years , to " recapture " money previously held in switzerland and attract the region 's increasingly wealthy savers . the new tax rules also apply to eu members ' dependencies - such as britain 's jersey and guernsey - plus monaco , liechtenstein , san marino and andorra , which have also placed a premium on discretion . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work .

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .
green parliamentarian werner schulz has already announced his intention to turn to the court if parliament is dissolved .
he said he was convinced that friday 's confidence vote was a farce .

in his speech prior to the vote , he said he needed a fresh mandate if he was to continue with his controversial package of reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder demonstrated in his speech that there is enough justification to dissolve parliament , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" he cleverly included president köhler into the circle of those responsible by pointing out that new elections are very much the will of the people .

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .

dw 's wolter von tiesenhausen looks at köhler 's first year in office . when he was elected to office last year köhler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country 's head of state .
it 's a promise he 's kept by speaking the truth - even when many may not want to hear it .
in the last 12 months , köhler , who headed up the international monetary fund before returning to germany last year , has not steered clear of controversy .
in fact he 's rubbed salt into many of germany 's open wounds by criticizing the german trait of not risking or changing anything and happily taking advantage of social services they do not need .
president decides on new elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler has promised to remain independent of german chanceller gerhard schröder most recently , he promised not to be influenced by german chancellor gerhard schröder 's wish for early elections .
now that the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has followed schröder 's wish of a negative vote of confidence , it will be up to president köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament .
it would go against the many efforts köhler has made for change in germany not to approve the request from all of the country 's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time .
on the other hand , he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it 's the right thing to do - meaning the election guessing game 's next round will now begin .
the business-friendly president ?
elected by germany 's conservative opposition , union leaders see köhler to be too business-friendly but do not take into account the scathing remarks he has had for acquisitive businesses that have often shown a lack of corporate responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : upon his election , köhler promised not to promote anyone else 's agenda if köhler has been unable to remain neutral when it comes to berlin 's political wrangling , then it certainly has n't hurt the public 's view of him .
that does n't come as much of a surprise as his job affords him a high profile and limited authority : he 's still near the top of public popularity polls , a position envied by just about every other german politician .
even with his limited powers , horst köhler has shown himself to be more than just a yes man who puts his stamp on everything that gets thrown his way .
he has remained an influential figure with trips around the globe and continues to work to push germany forward on the world stage - work he will most likely continue regardless of who sits in the chancellor 's seat this fall . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " the german parliament is expected to pass a no-confidence vote against chancellor gerhard schröder at his request friday in a move aimed at triggering early elections this autumn .

dw 's wolter von tiesenhausen looks at köhler 's first year in office . when he was elected to office last year köhler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country 's head of state .
it 's a promise he 's kept by speaking the truth - even when many may not want to hear it .
in the last 12 months , köhler , who headed up the international monetary fund before returning to germany last year , has not steered clear of controversy .
in fact he 's rubbed salt into many of germany 's open wounds by criticizing the german trait of not risking or changing anything and happily taking advantage of social services they do not need .
president decides on new elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler has promised to remain independent of german chanceller gerhard schröder most recently , he promised not to be influenced by german chancellor gerhard schröder 's wish for early elections .
now that the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has followed schröder 's wish of a negative vote of confidence , it will be up to president köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament .
it would go against the many efforts köhler has made for change in germany not to approve the request from all of the country 's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time .
on the other hand , he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it 's the right thing to do - meaning the election guessing game 's next round will now begin .
the business-friendly president ?
elected by germany 's conservative opposition , union leaders see köhler to be too business-friendly but do not take into account the scathing remarks he has had for acquisitive businesses that have often shown a lack of corporate responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : upon his election , köhler promised not to promote anyone else 's agenda if köhler has been unable to remain neutral when it comes to berlin 's political wrangling , then it certainly has n't hurt the public 's view of him .
that does n't come as much of a surprise as his job affords him a high profile and limited authority : he 's still near the top of public popularity polls , a position envied by just about every other german politician .
even with his limited powers , horst köhler has shown himself to be more than just a yes man who puts his stamp on everything that gets thrown his way .
he has remained an influential figure with trips around the globe and continues to work to push germany forward on the world stage - work he will most likely continue regardless of who sits in the chancellor 's seat this fall . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " the german parliament is expected to pass a no-confidence vote against chancellor gerhard schröder at his request friday in a move aimed at triggering early elections this autumn .

those days are over and germany is cautious about what the british eu presidency that starts friday will entail . they both wanted the " third way , " a mixture of social democratic principles with a health dash of more liberal economic policies .
not extremely to the left , not way on the right , but somewhere closer to the middle . just after his election , schröder talked about closer cooperation with his british counterpart and in 1999 , the so-called schröder-blair paper was the result .
it was a manifest for a modern social democracy in these modern , globalized times . now that paper has disappeared , likely in some archivist 's drawer , and the two men are not only no longer on the same page , they are n't even on the same chapter .
that 's why in berlin , there is a good dose of scepticism as britain takes over the six-month rotating eu presidency , and attempts to impose its own stamp on the european project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schussel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels , thursday 16 june 2005 .
" i 'm sad " were the words from schröder after the failed eu summit in june .
but besides expressing his emotions , the german leader left no doubt about who he held responsible for the failure , the british prime minister .
whoever wants to destroy the eu due to national obstinacy or populist motives sins against future generations , schröder spewed in the mass-circulation bild newspaper shortly after the summit . no doubt he did n't name names , but it was clear who the message was for .
even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .
still , sooner or later there has to be an agreement about the eu 's 2007 - 2013 budget , including the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies , which are as dear to france as the rebate is to the uk . " if there is a compromise during the british presidency , and we can only hope there will be one , then it will have to be very close to that which -lsb- luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude -rsb- juncker proposed at the summit , " schröder said , referring to a last-minute offer by juncker that failed in the end .
" we can only hope . " differing visions schröder is no more excited about what he considers blair 's vision for the eu as he is about he considers the british leader 's budgetary obstinacy .
for schöder , the eu is not just a common market , it is a success social model that has slowly risen from the ruins of world war two . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses the european parliament in brussels , thursday june 23 , 2005 .
blair warned that the european union risks failure if it does not modernize and meet the needs of its citizens .
speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "
in his speech before the european parliament , blair however rejected that accusation , saying he believed in the european project . " i must note that blair made it obvious that he is for a political union , " schröder said .
" the expectation that goes along with that and which the presidency must work under , that will be the deciding factor . " the germans have another expectation of the british eu presidency .
despite the " no " votes during the referendums on the eu constitution in france and the netherlands , and the decision of eu leaders to take some time for reflection , the constitution should not be put on hold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " reflection for me does not mean retreat nor is it another word for doing nothing , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" we ca n't afford any down time , neither internally nor externally , but we have to keep the process alive . " it with more than a little suspicion that the german government watches the britons take the eu reigns .
but at the same time , berlin says it is ready to take an active role in solving some of the eu 's pressing problems .
that 's likely the reason that despite the strong differences of opinion , schröder is keeping any personal criticism of blair to himself . " i have no intention of letting a serious , sensible discussion of facts degenerate into a personal controversy , " he said to reporters .
" so forget it . " nina werkhäuser -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bumpy eu ride nears end the last six months have been tumultuous for the eu and luxembourg , which held the eu presidency .

-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- blair urges eu to accept change ahead of taking over the eu presidency , tony blair addressed the european parliament thursday , amid criticism - including from germany - that his eu policy is motivated by a desire for a free trade area .

even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .

speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "

dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2005 eu tax dodgers lose swiss haven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping money out of the taxman 's sight in switzerland is now harder the good old days are almost over for europeans who have stashed their cash in switzerland , out of sight of the tax authorities in their homeland .
new rules mean accounts will be taxed . from july 1 , banks in switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - will begin taxing the savings accounts of eu residents on behalf of their governments , implementing an accord that bern and brussels reached after years of painstaking talks . " this is the first time in the world that banks have agreed to levy a tax on behalf of a foreign country , " said a spokesman of the swiss bankers association . the accord is meant to crack down on tax-dodgers who take advantage of swiss banking secrecy laws and is tied to a tightening of rules within the 25-member eu under a new directive on savings taxation . rather than automatically revealing the identity of the account-holder , banks in non-eu switzerland will initially levy a 15 percent withholding tax on the interest eu citizens earn on their savings . the rate will rise to 20 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 . swiss banks will keep a quarter of the levy to cover their costs , and hand over the rest to the saver 's home country . keeping secrets in exchange for agreeing to play tax collector for the eu , switzerland was able to protect its cherished system of banking secrecy , which has helped make the reputation of the country 's financial sector for critics and supporters alike and fuel the country 's prosperity . there are no official statistics for the number of swiss bank accounts belonging to eu residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : total funds managed by swiss banks in 2004 were around 3.55 trillion swiss francs -lrb- 2.29 trillion euros , $ 2.77 trillion -rrb- - an estimated one-third of global private assets . the country 's banks say they have spent 300 million swiss francs on setting up the computer systems needed to levy the eu tax . eu clients can alternatively authorize the banks to hand over their details to tax authorities in their home country , which can then calculate the exact sum they should pay . skirting the rules but even though the swiss-eu accord is meant to cut tax evasion , it has several loopholes . the withholding tax can be avoided by shaking up one 's portfolio .
the deal does not cover dividends , insurance products , capital gains or derivatives .
it only applies to individuals , not businesses , so wealthy customers can create a company in switzerland to mask their savings . germany 's finance minister hans eichel was one of the biggest supporters of the accord with the swiss , aiming to boost tax revenues at home by taxing the savings many germans are said to hide in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to swiss banks , the withholding tax will inject less than expected into eu nations ' coffers - and certainly not the hundred of millions of euros that eu governments have been hoping . publicly , swiss banks say they do not fear that customers will head to other financial centers where authorities have more inroads into bank accounts . foreign savers appreciate not only banking secrecy , but also the efficiency of swiss banks and the country 's political stability , bankers say here .
however , swiss banks have also made strategic moves to ensure they do not lose out , spreading operations to financial centers which are not included in the deal with the eu , such as singapore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite as impenetrable as they once were several large swiss banks have opened offices in asia in recent years , to " recapture " money previously held in switzerland and attract the region 's increasingly wealthy savers . the new tax rules also apply to eu members ' dependencies - such as britain 's jersey and guernsey - plus monaco , liechtenstein , san marino and andorra , which have also placed a premium on discretion . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work .

new rules mean accounts will be taxed . from july 1 , banks in switzerland - which is not a member of the european union - will begin taxing the savings accounts of eu residents on behalf of their governments , implementing an accord that bern and brussels reached after years of painstaking talks . " this is the first time in the world that banks have agreed to levy a tax on behalf of a foreign country , " said a spokesman of the swiss bankers association . the accord is meant to crack down on tax-dodgers who take advantage of swiss banking secrecy laws and is tied to a tightening of rules within the 25-member eu under a new directive on savings taxation . rather than automatically revealing the identity of the account-holder , banks in non-eu switzerland will initially levy a 15 percent withholding tax on the interest eu citizens earn on their savings . the rate will rise to 20 percent in 2008 and 35 percent in 2011 . swiss banks will keep a quarter of the levy to cover their costs , and hand over the rest to the saver 's home country . keeping secrets in exchange for agreeing to play tax collector for the eu , switzerland was able to protect its cherished system of banking secrecy , which has helped make the reputation of the country 's financial sector for critics and supporters alike and fuel the country 's prosperity . there are no official statistics for the number of swiss bank accounts belonging to eu residents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : total funds managed by swiss banks in 2004 were around 3.55 trillion swiss francs -lrb- 2.29 trillion euros , $ 2.77 trillion -rrb- - an estimated one-third of global private assets . the country 's banks say they have spent 300 million swiss francs on setting up the computer systems needed to levy the eu tax . eu clients can alternatively authorize the banks to hand over their details to tax authorities in their home country , which can then calculate the exact sum they should pay . skirting the rules but even though the swiss-eu accord is meant to cut tax evasion , it has several loopholes . the withholding tax can be avoided by shaking up one 's portfolio .
the deal does not cover dividends , insurance products , capital gains or derivatives .
it only applies to individuals , not businesses , so wealthy customers can create a company in switzerland to mask their savings . germany 's finance minister hans eichel was one of the biggest supporters of the accord with the swiss , aiming to boost tax revenues at home by taxing the savings many germans are said to hide in switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to swiss banks , the withholding tax will inject less than expected into eu nations ' coffers - and certainly not the hundred of millions of euros that eu governments have been hoping . publicly , swiss banks say they do not fear that customers will head to other financial centers where authorities have more inroads into bank accounts . foreign savers appreciate not only banking secrecy , but also the efficiency of swiss banks and the country 's political stability , bankers say here .
however , swiss banks have also made strategic moves to ensure they do not lose out , spreading operations to financial centers which are not included in the deal with the eu , such as singapore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not quite as impenetrable as they once were several large swiss banks have opened offices in asia in recent years , to " recapture " money previously held in switzerland and attract the region 's increasingly wealthy savers . the new tax rules also apply to eu members ' dependencies - such as britain 's jersey and guernsey - plus monaco , liechtenstein , san marino and andorra , which have also placed a premium on discretion . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

the ' yes ' votes tallied 151 . the procedure which leads to new elections is based on article 68 of the german basic law , which says : " if a vote of confidence brought by the federal chancellor is not approved by a majority of the members of the bundestag , the president of the federal republic can , at the request of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within 21 days . " president 's decision president horst köhler therefore has until july 22 to officially recognize the lack of a majority and dissolve the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler has not yet revealed what his intentions are , saying only that he would study the situation after the vote . if the bundestag is dissolved , köhler must call an election to take place within 60 days .
however the election can only take place on a holiday or a sunday . the election can not take place during the school summer holidays , which vary according to the regional states - in bavaria for example they do not end until september 12 . most observers agree that the date of september 18 is the most likely for an election . however the decision is far from certain . some of the smaller political parties and a handful of coalition deputies have vowed to mount a federal court challenge against bringing the poll forward . precedents there are two precedents for the confidence vote in the history of the german federal republic . in 1972 , chancellor willy brandt lost a confidence vote he called in the face of a highly divided parliament .
he went on to gain a comfortable majority in the ensuing general election . in 1983 , chancellor helmut kohl called a confidence vote after coming to power the previous year following the resignation of former chancellor helmut schmidt . kohl lost the confidence vote and won the subsequent election . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder loses confidence vote with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrosso and blair " the one thing everybody in europe will agree on is that this is an interesting moment to take on the presidency of the european union , " blair told a joint news conference with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " the general task is to try to initiate , in a cooperative and inclusive way , a debate about the future direction of europe , " he said , in remarks that saw him try to take the heat out of the disputes that are plaguing the bloc . a mid-way summit to discuss the future blair , who earlier held talks with barroso and other commissioners , said britain would host a summit of eu leaders mid-way through its presidency , which would also explore social reforms . " we have agreed that it would be sensible for the presidency to hold an informal summit in the autumn at which the leaders of europe would come together and discuss how europe makes progress in the future , how we give the energy and commitment to the european project , " blair said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france categorically rejected the constitution he said the european commission would draw up a paper on europe 's social model and how it functions in a world of globalization and that leaders would discuss it during the pause for reflection announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's constitution . but he categorically ruled out trying to change the treaty or better chart the troubled club 's future .
" i ca n't make progress on that in these six months , " he said . economic reform top priority in a working document for the next six months , london put economic reform at the top of its agenda , including reexamining the divisive issue of farm subsidies , which has propelled britain into a major battle with france . blair hopes to secure a deal on the 2007-2013 budget , but it remains unclear whether france in particular will be accommodating , given london 's steadfast refusal to part with its widely-detested but jealously-guarded budget rebate without an overhaul of the union 's long-term financing system . " we will do our best to make progress and to reach an agreement ; whether it is possible or not i really do n't know and neither does anyone at this stage , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders during crisis talks over the bloc 's finances earlier in june " it is important , obviously , that we try to reach an agreement , particularly after what happened at the previous summit of the european union , " he said , referring to a conclave two weeks ago that ended in failure , throwing the bloc into further strife after it ran into a crisis over its planned constitution . again trying to reach out to his partners , blair said : " i think there is less of a disagreement than people really make out . " for his part , barosso said he believed london 's presidency would be a " success " and threw his support behind blair 's agenda for reform to make europe more competitive with emerging giants such as china and india . " it 's a rough period for european politics and that is why this british presidency has a really very important responsibility . " turkey and security issues turning to other priorities in the coming months , blair highlighted future eu enlargement as well as stronger cooperation between member states on security issues such as terrorism , organised crime and illegal immigration .

volkert was sent packing due to " irregularities " in connection with an alleged bribery scandal surrounding skoda 's former head of personnel , helmut schuster , the sources said , confirming a corresponding report in the online version of the weekly magazine der spiegel . volkert has been head of vw 's general works council since 1990 and also sits on the car maker 's supervisory board .
in the 1990s , he was involved in the introduction of the four-day week in vw and the " 5000 x 5000 " model .
rumors of his close ties with the management made him unpopular among some of the employees . resignation under pressure ? the vw general works council announced thursday night that volkert was " aware of the expected public discussions about the apparent irregularities that were connected to him . " volkert himself denied being involved in criminal activities . but the head of the powerful ig metall labor union , jürgen peters , said that volkert had been thinking of stepping down early for some time . der spiegel reported that internal auditors at vw were looking into allegations that volkert and schuster were involved in a company that had been bidding to win a contract from skoda . schuster , who quit earlier this month , is already being investigated by prosecutors on allegations he received bribes from potential suppliers . vw ceo bernd pischetsrieder promised a close investigation of the allegations against other vw employees and full cooperation with the judiciary . tip of the iceberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the vokswagen reputation be tarnished because of the bribery scandal ?
the german economic magazine wirtschaftwoche , citing well-informed circles , claims that the skoda bribery scandal has much wider implications and that volkert 's resignation is by no means the end of the affair . the magazine claims that certain politicians , including former minister president of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , and german chancellor gerhard schröder , were aware of the wrongdoings in vw 's skoda unit . both politicians rejected the claims as unfounded . " this is a wrong , defamatory allegation , " said bela anda , a government spokesperson .

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .
green parliamentarian werner schulz has already announced his intention to turn to the court if parliament is dissolved .
he said he was convinced that friday 's confidence vote was a farce .
interior minister otto schily defended the vote as constitutional , adding that schröder 's course of action was " courageous , fair and confident . "
deliberate defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder addressing parliamentarians on friday schröder orchestrated friday 's defeat to keep alive his strategy of holding early elections as soon as this september .

" schröder demonstrated in his speech that there is enough justification to dissolve parliament , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" he cleverly included president köhler into the circle of those responsible by pointing out that new elections are very much the will of the people .
he put the pressure on köhler to approve it . "
according to pollsters , schröder is playing with fire .

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .
green parliamentarian werner schulz has already announced his intention to turn to the court if parliament is dissolved .
he said he was convinced that friday 's confidence vote was a farce .
interior minister otto schily defended the vote as constitutional , adding that schröder 's course of action was " courageous , fair and confident . "
deliberate defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder addressing parliamentarians on friday schröder orchestrated friday 's defeat to keep alive his strategy of holding early elections as soon as this september .
in his speech prior to the vote , he said he needed a fresh mandate if he was to continue with his controversial package of reforms known as agenda 2010 .
" schröder demonstrated in his speech that there is enough justification to dissolve parliament , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" he cleverly included president köhler into the circle of those responsible by pointing out that new elections are very much the will of the people .
he put the pressure on köhler to approve it . "
according to pollsters , schröder is playing with fire .
an early run-off against the conservative candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , could see an end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .
schröder 's party trails the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- heavily in opinion polls .
support for his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- is also being siphoned off by a new leftist alliance made up in part by dissenting ex-spd members . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " german chancellor gerhard schröder called on parliament to pave the way for early elections as he opened a debate in a no confidence motion he is hoping to lose .

dw 's wolter von tiesenhausen looks at köhler 's first year in office . when he was elected to office last year köhler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country 's head of state .
it 's a promise he 's kept by speaking the truth - even when many may not want to hear it .
in the last 12 months , köhler , who headed up the international monetary fund before returning to germany last year , has not steered clear of controversy .
in fact he 's rubbed salt into many of germany 's open wounds by criticizing the german trait of not risking or changing anything and happily taking advantage of social services they do not need .
president decides on new elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler has promised to remain independent of german chanceller gerhard schröder most recently , he promised not to be influenced by german chancellor gerhard schröder 's wish for early elections .
now that the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has followed schröder 's wish of a negative vote of confidence , it will be up to president köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament .
it would go against the many efforts köhler has made for change in germany not to approve the request from all of the country 's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time .
on the other hand , he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it 's the right thing to do - meaning the election guessing game 's next round will now begin .
the business-friendly president ?
elected by germany 's conservative opposition , union leaders see köhler to be too business-friendly but do not take into account the scathing remarks he has had for acquisitive businesses that have often shown a lack of corporate responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : upon his election , köhler promised not to promote anyone else 's agenda if köhler has been unable to remain neutral when it comes to berlin 's political wrangling , then it certainly has n't hurt the public 's view of him .
that does n't come as much of a surprise as his job affords him a high profile and limited authority : he 's still near the top of public popularity polls , a position envied by just about every other german politician .
even with his limited powers , horst köhler has shown himself to be more than just a yes man who puts his stamp on everything that gets thrown his way .
he has remained an influential figure with trips around the globe and continues to work to push germany forward on the world stage - work he will most likely continue regardless of who sits in the chancellor 's seat this fall . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " the german parliament is expected to pass a no-confidence vote against chancellor gerhard schröder at his request friday in a move aimed at triggering early elections this autumn .

president decides on new elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler has promised to remain independent of german chanceller gerhard schröder most recently , he promised not to be influenced by german chancellor gerhard schröder 's wish for early elections .
now that the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has followed schröder 's wish of a negative vote of confidence , it will be up to president köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament .
it would go against the many efforts köhler has made for change in germany not to approve the request from all of the country 's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time .
on the other hand , he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it 's the right thing to do - meaning the election guessing game 's next round will now begin .

that does n't come as much of a surprise as his job affords him a high profile and limited authority : he 's still near the top of public popularity polls , a position envied by just about every other german politician .
even with his limited powers , horst köhler has shown himself to be more than just a yes man who puts his stamp on everything that gets thrown his way .
he has remained an influential figure with trips around the globe and continues to work to push germany forward on the world stage - work he will most likely continue regardless of who sits in the chancellor 's seat this fall . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " the german parliament is expected to pass a no-confidence vote against chancellor gerhard schröder at his request friday in a move aimed at triggering early elections this autumn .

the ' yes ' votes tallied 151 . the procedure which leads to new elections is based on article 68 of the german basic law , which says : " if a vote of confidence brought by the federal chancellor is not approved by a majority of the members of the bundestag , the president of the federal republic can , at the request of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within 21 days . " president 's decision president horst köhler therefore has until july 22 to officially recognize the lack of a majority and dissolve the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler has not yet revealed what his intentions are , saying only that he would study the situation after the vote . if the bundestag is dissolved , köhler must call an election to take place within 60 days .
however the election can only take place on a holiday or a sunday . the election can not take place during the school summer holidays , which vary according to the regional states - in bavaria for example they do not end until september 12 . most observers agree that the date of september 18 is the most likely for an election . however the decision is far from certain . some of the smaller political parties and a handful of coalition deputies have vowed to mount a federal court challenge against bringing the poll forward . precedents there are two precedents for the confidence vote in the history of the german federal republic . in 1972 , chancellor willy brandt lost a confidence vote he called in the face of a highly divided parliament .
he went on to gain a comfortable majority in the ensuing general election . in 1983 , chancellor helmut kohl called a confidence vote after coming to power the previous year following the resignation of former chancellor helmut schmidt . kohl lost the confidence vote and won the subsequent election . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder loses confidence vote with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 germany 's hopes for british-led eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's heading the eu starting friday once upon a time , german chancellor schröder wanted to learn from british premier blair .
those days are over and germany is cautious about what the british eu presidency that starts friday will entail . they both wanted the " third way , " a mixture of social democratic principles with a health dash of more liberal economic policies .
not extremely to the left , not way on the right , but somewhere closer to the middle . just after his election , schröder talked about closer cooperation with his british counterpart and in 1999 , the so-called schröder-blair paper was the result .
it was a manifest for a modern social democracy in these modern , globalized times . now that paper has disappeared , likely in some archivist 's drawer , and the two men are not only no longer on the same page , they are n't even on the same chapter .
that 's why in berlin , there is a good dose of scepticism as britain takes over the six-month rotating eu presidency , and attempts to impose its own stamp on the european project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schussel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels , thursday 16 june 2005 .
" i 'm sad " were the words from schröder after the failed eu summit in june .
but besides expressing his emotions , the german leader left no doubt about who he held responsible for the failure , the british prime minister .
whoever wants to destroy the eu due to national obstinacy or populist motives sins against future generations , schröder spewed in the mass-circulation bild newspaper shortly after the summit . no doubt he did n't name names , but it was clear who the message was for .
even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .
still , sooner or later there has to be an agreement about the eu 's 2007 - 2013 budget , including the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies , which are as dear to france as the rebate is to the uk . " if there is a compromise during the british presidency , and we can only hope there will be one , then it will have to be very close to that which -lsb- luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude -rsb- juncker proposed at the summit , " schröder said , referring to a last-minute offer by juncker that failed in the end .
" we can only hope . " differing visions schröder is no more excited about what he considers blair 's vision for the eu as he is about he considers the british leader 's budgetary obstinacy .
for schöder , the eu is not just a common market , it is a success social model that has slowly risen from the ruins of world war two . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses the european parliament in brussels , thursday june 23 , 2005 .
blair warned that the european union risks failure if it does not modernize and meet the needs of its citizens .
speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "
in his speech before the european parliament , blair however rejected that accusation , saying he believed in the european project . " i must note that blair made it obvious that he is for a political union , " schröder said .
" the expectation that goes along with that and which the presidency must work under , that will be the deciding factor . " the germans have another expectation of the british eu presidency .
despite the " no " votes during the referendums on the eu constitution in france and the netherlands , and the decision of eu leaders to take some time for reflection , the constitution should not be put on hold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " reflection for me does not mean retreat nor is it another word for doing nothing , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" we ca n't afford any down time , neither internally nor externally , but we have to keep the process alive . " it with more than a little suspicion that the german government watches the britons take the eu reigns .
but at the same time , berlin says it is ready to take an active role in solving some of the eu 's pressing problems .
that 's likely the reason that despite the strong differences of opinion , schröder is keeping any personal criticism of blair to himself . " i have no intention of letting a serious , sensible discussion of facts degenerate into a personal controversy , " he said to reporters .
" so forget it . " nina werkhäuser -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bumpy eu ride nears end the last six months have been tumultuous for the eu and luxembourg , which held the eu presidency .

those days are over and germany is cautious about what the british eu presidency that starts friday will entail . they both wanted the " third way , " a mixture of social democratic principles with a health dash of more liberal economic policies .
not extremely to the left , not way on the right , but somewhere closer to the middle . just after his election , schröder talked about closer cooperation with his british counterpart and in 1999 , the so-called schröder-blair paper was the result .
it was a manifest for a modern social democracy in these modern , globalized times . now that paper has disappeared , likely in some archivist 's drawer , and the two men are not only no longer on the same page , they are n't even on the same chapter .
that 's why in berlin , there is a good dose of scepticism as britain takes over the six-month rotating eu presidency , and attempts to impose its own stamp on the european project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schussel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels , thursday 16 june 2005 .
" i 'm sad " were the words from schröder after the failed eu summit in june .
but besides expressing his emotions , the german leader left no doubt about who he held responsible for the failure , the british prime minister .
whoever wants to destroy the eu due to national obstinacy or populist motives sins against future generations , schröder spewed in the mass-circulation bild newspaper shortly after the summit . no doubt he did n't name names , but it was clear who the message was for .
even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .
still , sooner or later there has to be an agreement about the eu 's 2007 - 2013 budget , including the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies , which are as dear to france as the rebate is to the uk . " if there is a compromise during the british presidency , and we can only hope there will be one , then it will have to be very close to that which -lsb- luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude -rsb- juncker proposed at the summit , " schröder said , referring to a last-minute offer by juncker that failed in the end .
" we can only hope . " differing visions schröder is no more excited about what he considers blair 's vision for the eu as he is about he considers the british leader 's budgetary obstinacy .

blair warned that the european union risks failure if it does not modernize and meet the needs of its citizens .
speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "
in his speech before the european parliament , blair however rejected that accusation , saying he believed in the european project . " i must note that blair made it obvious that he is for a political union , " schröder said .
" the expectation that goes along with that and which the presidency must work under , that will be the deciding factor . " the germans have another expectation of the british eu presidency .

those days are over and germany is cautious about what the british eu presidency that starts friday will entail . they both wanted the " third way , " a mixture of social democratic principles with a health dash of more liberal economic policies .
not extremely to the left , not way on the right , but somewhere closer to the middle . just after his election , schröder talked about closer cooperation with his british counterpart and in 1999 , the so-called schröder-blair paper was the result .
it was a manifest for a modern social democracy in these modern , globalized times . now that paper has disappeared , likely in some archivist 's drawer , and the two men are not only no longer on the same page , they are n't even on the same chapter .
that 's why in berlin , there is a good dose of scepticism as britain takes over the six-month rotating eu presidency , and attempts to impose its own stamp on the european project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from l-r german foreign minister joschka fischer , german chancellor gerhard schroeder , dutch prime minister jan-peter balkenende and austrian chancellor wolfgang schussel chat during the round table at the beginning of the two days european summit in brussels , thursday 16 june 2005 .
" i 'm sad " were the words from schröder after the failed eu summit in june .
but besides expressing his emotions , the german leader left no doubt about who he held responsible for the failure , the british prime minister .
whoever wants to destroy the eu due to national obstinacy or populist motives sins against future generations , schröder spewed in the mass-circulation bild newspaper shortly after the summit . no doubt he did n't name names , but it was clear who the message was for .
even before the summit , schröder fulminated against the rebate britain gets from the eu in front of parliament . " there is no longer any justification for this rebate , since great britain is in 6th place as regards per capita income , but far below that in pro capital payments to the eu , " he said . schröder did n't seriously speculate that the british would do away with their beloved rebate during their six months at the helm .
still , sooner or later there has to be an agreement about the eu 's 2007 - 2013 budget , including the sensitive issue of agricultural subsidies , which are as dear to france as the rebate is to the uk . " if there is a compromise during the british presidency , and we can only hope there will be one , then it will have to be very close to that which -lsb- luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude -rsb- juncker proposed at the summit , " schröder said , referring to a last-minute offer by juncker that failed in the end .
" we can only hope . " differing visions schröder is no more excited about what he considers blair 's vision for the eu as he is about he considers the british leader 's budgetary obstinacy .
for schöder , the eu is not just a common market , it is a success social model that has slowly risen from the ruins of world war two . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses the european parliament in brussels , thursday june 23 , 2005 .
blair warned that the european union risks failure if it does not modernize and meet the needs of its citizens .
speaking to the european parliament , launching his country 's presidency of the eu , blair said that " if europe defaulted to euroskepticism ... then we risk failure , and failure on a grand strategic scale . "
in his speech before the european parliament , blair however rejected that accusation , saying he believed in the european project . " i must note that blair made it obvious that he is for a political union , " schröder said .
" the expectation that goes along with that and which the presidency must work under , that will be the deciding factor . " the germans have another expectation of the british eu presidency .
despite the " no " votes during the referendums on the eu constitution in france and the netherlands , and the decision of eu leaders to take some time for reflection , the constitution should not be put on hold . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " reflection for me does not mean retreat nor is it another word for doing nothing , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" we ca n't afford any down time , neither internally nor externally , but we have to keep the process alive . " it with more than a little suspicion that the german government watches the britons take the eu reigns .
but at the same time , berlin says it is ready to take an active role in solving some of the eu 's pressing problems .
that 's likely the reason that despite the strong differences of opinion , schröder is keeping any personal criticism of blair to himself . " i have no intention of letting a serious , sensible discussion of facts degenerate into a personal controversy , " he said to reporters .
" so forget it . " nina werkhäuser -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bumpy eu ride nears end the last six months have been tumultuous for the eu and luxembourg , which held the eu presidency .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bundeswehr soldier as part of the isaf -lrb- international security assistance force -rrb- in afghanistan .
germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage showing strains a marriage , the saying goes , starts to show the first strains after seven years .
schröder 's coalition is facing the same fate .
" looking back , the red-green social political experiment failed , " said andersen .
the greens have made noises that they will not vote against schröder in today 's vote of confidence , and doom their own government .
schröder 's campaign team , meanwhile , has let it be known that they will go into the election fight alone , without the help of their coalition partner . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to superstar fischer ?

a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .

the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .

a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .

germany is the second largest troop contributor in afghanistan 's after the u.s. schröder underwent a transformation of his own , from a foreign policy rookie and euroskeptic to one of the eu 's most influential players and a chancellor willing to deploy german soldiers into conflicts .
in 2002 , he won re-election largely by opposing u.s. president george w. bush 's planned invasion of iraq .
" quietly walking around does n't exist anymore , the -lrb- foreign -rrb- policy is formulated very clearly and very loudly , " said andreas maurer , an analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs .
" schröder has tried to make -lrb- looking out -rrb- for national interests part of the vocabulary . "
breaking point but domestically , he was not as determined .
the red-green coalition post-2002 has been a study in hesitancy and non-committal policies .
andersen credits schröder with realizing it was time to introduce reforms that would tackle germany 's low investment rates , stubbornly high unemployment rates and overly generous welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a waiting room at a munich unemployment agency .
the number of jobless germans reached 4.7 million in june , or 11.3 percent of the population .
" schröder shook up the party , which was probably needed , " he said .
" the spd followed the chancellor , but without real conviction . "
industry heads and economic experts , meanwhile , criticized schröder 's agenda 2010 for not going far enough in reforming the country 's rigid labor laws and stemming the tide of german companies looking abroad for a better investment climate .
strains after seven years of marriage germans , and his spd , were getting more and more frustrated with schröder 's grand promises .
around 4.7 million people are currently unemployed , more than a million more than when schröder took power in 1998 , promising then to cut unemployment .
on may 22 , the shaky support the spd gave its chancellor collapsed in a landslide .
massive losses on that day in state elections in north-rhine westphalia put the cdu in power in that traditional spd stronghold and gave the leftist wing of the party a reason to break off .
a newly formed alliance between the pds , the successor to east germany 's communist party , and disgruntled spd leftists threatens to siphon away votes should an election take place this fall .
the greens , meanwhile , were caught completely unawares by schröder 's announcement to hold early elections and have publicly criticized the chancellor for giving up on their coalition .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 the troubled red-green legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens were often the driving force in the government 's reforms hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament friday .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far . schröder 's government was a seminal experiment in german politics .
after starting fast out of the gate in 1998 , the two parties have faded just as quickly of late .
given the deep-set feeling of frustration in germany at the moment , it seems hard to believe that it was only seven years ago that the country was awash in optimism .
after 16 years in power , germans had voted helmut kohl and the ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats -lrb- cdu and fdp -rrb- out of power , giving the mandate to the ascendant social democrats and his green party partners .
the red-green coalition , as it was known , was a groundbreaking social experiment in german politics that was to wipe away the corruption and glacial pace of the kohl government and lead the country down a new , reform-minded path .
seven years later , schröder 's social democrats and greens are on the brink of collapse amid rising unemployment rates and reforms that have proven unpopular with wide swathes of the population .
the chancellor wants parliamentary elections brought forward , perhaps as early as september , which is a year earlier than planned .
the parliament voted against the chancellor on friday , which is what schröder wanted .
if president horst köhler and the constitutional court approve the measure , germans will be heading to the ballot box this fall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor helmut kohl was voted out in 1998 after 16 years in power if opinion polls are right , schröder and his coalition will get walloped in the september elections , bringing an end to what analysts say was a well-meaning , but ultimately unsuccessful , political experiment .
a new experiment " it was a societal attempt to bring about a new coalition that had an anchor in the new middle , " said uwe andersen , a political analyst at the ruhr-university in bochum .
the new government 's leaders were former leftist radicals and anti-establishment activists from the late 1960s who railed against germany 's stodgy conservatism in street demonstrations and demanded it re-examine its nazi past .
three decades later , schröder came into power , one year after british prime minister tony blair , and joined him in embracing the " third way " philosophy on governing that sought to balance social responsibility with economic dynamism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair -lrb- l . -rrb- and schröder 's relationship has n't been as chummy of late red-green set about passing laws that allowed dual citizenship for immigrants to germany up to a certain age , and legalized gay unions .
the greens , the permanent opposition party born out of the pacifist , environmental movement of the late 1970s and early 80s , became the engine behind many of these changes , said andersen .
" the spd , at heart , were a pretty conservative party , " he said in an interview .
the greens also convinced schröder 's social democrats to push for an environmental tax and for a phase out of nuclear energy by 2023 .
the first reactors have already been taken off line with more planned unless a new cdu government reverses the trend .
a new face in the world the greens also gave the government one of its most popular figures .
foreign minister joschka fischer became a representative of an increasingly bolder germany on the world stage .
fischer , who was photographed beating up a police officer during a riot in the 1970s , became an adept diplomat , helping steer the european union 's policy on middle east peace and iran 's nuclear ambitions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.07.2005 blair launches presidency with informal summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this is an interesting moment to take on the eu presidency " britain began its six-month presidency of the european union friday with prime minister tony blair pledging to hold an informal summit later this year to debate the future of the crisis-torn bloc . blair also promised to work hard to negotiate a deal on the thorny issue of financing and farm subsidies , during what will likely be a rocky half year at the helm of the restless 25-nation group .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrosso and blair " the one thing everybody in europe will agree on is that this is an interesting moment to take on the presidency of the european union , " blair told a joint news conference with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " the general task is to try to initiate , in a cooperative and inclusive way , a debate about the future direction of europe , " he said , in remarks that saw him try to take the heat out of the disputes that are plaguing the bloc . a mid-way summit to discuss the future blair , who earlier held talks with barroso and other commissioners , said britain would host a summit of eu leaders mid-way through its presidency , which would also explore social reforms . " we have agreed that it would be sensible for the presidency to hold an informal summit in the autumn at which the leaders of europe would come together and discuss how europe makes progress in the future , how we give the energy and commitment to the european project , " blair said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france categorically rejected the constitution he said the european commission would draw up a paper on europe 's social model and how it functions in a world of globalization and that leaders would discuss it during the pause for reflection announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's constitution . but he categorically ruled out trying to change the treaty or better chart the troubled club 's future .
" i ca n't make progress on that in these six months , " he said . economic reform top priority in a working document for the next six months , london put economic reform at the top of its agenda , including reexamining the divisive issue of farm subsidies , which has propelled britain into a major battle with france . blair hopes to secure a deal on the 2007-2013 budget , but it remains unclear whether france in particular will be accommodating , given london 's steadfast refusal to part with its widely-detested but jealously-guarded budget rebate without an overhaul of the union 's long-term financing system . " we will do our best to make progress and to reach an agreement ; whether it is possible or not i really do n't know and neither does anyone at this stage , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders during crisis talks over the bloc 's finances earlier in june " it is important , obviously , that we try to reach an agreement , particularly after what happened at the previous summit of the european union , " he said , referring to a conclave two weeks ago that ended in failure , throwing the bloc into further strife after it ran into a crisis over its planned constitution . again trying to reach out to his partners , blair said : " i think there is less of a disagreement than people really make out . " for his part , barosso said he believed london 's presidency would be a " success " and threw his support behind blair 's agenda for reform to make europe more competitive with emerging giants such as china and india . " it 's a rough period for european politics and that is why this british presidency has a really very important responsibility . " turkey and security issues turning to other priorities in the coming months , blair highlighted future eu enlargement as well as stronger cooperation between member states on security issues such as terrorism , organised crime and illegal immigration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 what next for schröder 's government ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's made his move , now it 's the president 's turn when the german parliament defeated the confidence vote brought by chancellor gerhard schröder on friday , it set in motion a procedure designed to end in a general election in the fall . schröder had wanted the vote to be defeated in order to trigger new elections 12 months ahead of schedule and had instructed members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to abstain in the vote in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament . the tactic worked - 296 voted against the measure and 148 abstained out of a total of 595 votes .
the ' yes ' votes tallied 151 . the procedure which leads to new elections is based on article 68 of the german basic law , which says : " if a vote of confidence brought by the federal chancellor is not approved by a majority of the members of the bundestag , the president of the federal republic can , at the request of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within 21 days . " president 's decision president horst köhler therefore has until july 22 to officially recognize the lack of a majority and dissolve the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler köhler has not yet revealed what his intentions are , saying only that he would study the situation after the vote . if the bundestag is dissolved , köhler must call an election to take place within 60 days .
however the election can only take place on a holiday or a sunday . the election can not take place during the school summer holidays , which vary according to the regional states - in bavaria for example they do not end until september 12 . most observers agree that the date of september 18 is the most likely for an election . however the decision is far from certain . some of the smaller political parties and a handful of coalition deputies have vowed to mount a federal court challenge against bringing the poll forward . precedents there are two precedents for the confidence vote in the history of the german federal republic . in 1972 , chancellor willy brandt lost a confidence vote he called in the face of a highly divided parliament .
he went on to gain a comfortable majority in the ensuing general election . in 1983 , chancellor helmut kohl called a confidence vote after coming to power the previous year following the resignation of former chancellor helmut schmidt . kohl lost the confidence vote and won the subsequent election . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder loses confidence vote with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure .

with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure . schröder 's strategy of deliberately losing friday 's vote of confidence in the german bundestag in order to force early elections paid off , with 151 parliamentarians voting in support of his government , 296 voting against , and 148 abstentions .
schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .
even if köhler were to decide to dissolve parliament , that move could later be overturned by the constitutional court .
green parliamentarian werner schulz has already announced his intention to turn to the court if parliament is dissolved .
he said he was convinced that friday 's confidence vote was a farce .
interior minister otto schily defended the vote as constitutional , adding that schröder 's course of action was " courageous , fair and confident . "
deliberate defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder addressing parliamentarians on friday schröder orchestrated friday 's defeat to keep alive his strategy of holding early elections as soon as this september .

" schröder demonstrated in his speech that there is enough justification to dissolve parliament , " gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , told reuters .
" he cleverly included president köhler into the circle of those responsible by pointing out that new elections are very much the will of the people .
he put the pressure on köhler to approve it . "
according to pollsters , schröder is playing with fire .
an early run-off against the conservative candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , could see an end to schröder 's seven-year tenure .

schröder needed a majority of 301 votes to win the motion .
the chancellor is now free to ask german president horst köhler to dissolve parliament and call a general election .
köhler has three weeks in which to decide whether or not he will comply , meaning that the fate of the current spd-greens coalition is now largely in the president 's hands .
during that time , the government will be in limbo , awaiting his decision .

dw 's wolter von tiesenhausen looks at köhler 's first year in office . when he was elected to office last year köhler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country 's head of state .
it 's a promise he 's kept by speaking the truth - even when many may not want to hear it .
in the last 12 months , köhler , who headed up the international monetary fund before returning to germany last year , has not steered clear of controversy .
in fact he 's rubbed salt into many of germany 's open wounds by criticizing the german trait of not risking or changing anything and happily taking advantage of social services they do not need .
president decides on new elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler has promised to remain independent of german chanceller gerhard schröder most recently , he promised not to be influenced by german chancellor gerhard schröder 's wish for early elections .
now that the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has followed schröder 's wish of a negative vote of confidence , it will be up to president köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament .
it would go against the many efforts köhler has made for change in germany not to approve the request from all of the country 's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time .
on the other hand , he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it 's the right thing to do - meaning the election guessing game 's next round will now begin .
the business-friendly president ?
elected by germany 's conservative opposition , union leaders see köhler to be too business-friendly but do not take into account the scathing remarks he has had for acquisitive businesses that have often shown a lack of corporate responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : upon his election , köhler promised not to promote anyone else 's agenda if köhler has been unable to remain neutral when it comes to berlin 's political wrangling , then it certainly has n't hurt the public 's view of him .
that does n't come as much of a surprise as his job affords him a high profile and limited authority : he 's still near the top of public popularity polls , a position envied by just about every other german politician .
even with his limited powers , horst köhler has shown himself to be more than just a yes man who puts his stamp on everything that gets thrown his way .
he has remained an influential figure with trips around the globe and continues to work to push germany forward on the world stage - work he will most likely continue regardless of who sits in the chancellor 's seat this fall . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " the german parliament is expected to pass a no-confidence vote against chancellor gerhard schröder at his request friday in a move aimed at triggering early elections this autumn .
-lrb- july 1 , 2005 -rrb- köhler halts ratification of eu constitution german president horst köhler on wednesday decided to halt his country 's ratification of the eu constitution as germany 's highest court is still reviewing an appeal against the treaty 's approval .
-lrb- june 15 , 2005 -rrb- köhler elected german president horst köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , was elected germany 's new president on sunday .
he said he wanted to use the ceremonial post to make the country a " land of ideas . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.07.2005 opinion : all eyes on germany 's president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler will decide whether germany faces early elections not from the political elite himself , german president horst köhler faces the politically charged decision of whether or not to dissolve parliament .
dw 's wolter von tiesenhausen looks at köhler 's first year in office . when he was elected to office last year köhler promised to use his position to work on the problems facing germany and not to let anyone influence his decisions as the country 's head of state .
it 's a promise he 's kept by speaking the truth - even when many may not want to hear it .
in the last 12 months , köhler , who headed up the international monetary fund before returning to germany last year , has not steered clear of controversy .
in fact he 's rubbed salt into many of germany 's open wounds by criticizing the german trait of not risking or changing anything and happily taking advantage of social services they do not need .
president decides on new elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler has promised to remain independent of german chanceller gerhard schröder most recently , he promised not to be influenced by german chancellor gerhard schröder 's wish for early elections .
now that the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , has followed schröder 's wish of a negative vote of confidence , it will be up to president köhler to decide whether to dissolve the parliament .
it would go against the many efforts köhler has made for change in germany not to approve the request from all of the country 's major political parties and refusing to open the path to new elections a year ahead of time .
on the other hand , he is also self-confident and independent enough to push through his own position if he thinks it 's the right thing to do - meaning the election guessing game 's next round will now begin .
the business-friendly president ?
elected by germany 's conservative opposition , union leaders see köhler to be too business-friendly but do not take into account the scathing remarks he has had for acquisitive businesses that have often shown a lack of corporate responsibility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : upon his election , köhler promised not to promote anyone else 's agenda if köhler has been unable to remain neutral when it comes to berlin 's political wrangling , then it certainly has n't hurt the public 's view of him .
that does n't come as much of a surprise as his job affords him a high profile and limited authority : he 's still near the top of public popularity polls , a position envied by just about every other german politician .
even with his limited powers , horst köhler has shown himself to be more than just a yes man who puts his stamp on everything that gets thrown his way .
he has remained an influential figure with trips around the globe and continues to work to push germany forward on the world stage - work he will most likely continue regardless of who sits in the chancellor 's seat this fall . wolter von tiesenhausen -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : " new elections needed " the german parliament is expected to pass a no-confidence vote against chancellor gerhard schröder at his request friday in a move aimed at triggering early elections this autumn .
-lrb- july 1 , 2005 -rrb- köhler halts ratification of eu constitution german president horst köhler on wednesday decided to halt his country 's ratification of the eu constitution as germany 's highest court is still reviewing an appeal against the treaty 's approval .
-lrb- june 15 , 2005 -rrb- köhler elected german president horst köhler , the former head of the international monetary fund , was elected germany 's new president on sunday .
he said he wanted to use the ceremonial post to make the country a " land of ideas . "
-lrb- may 24 , 2004 -rrb- feedback should köhler base his decision to dissolve parliament on what germany 's political parties want or on his own opinions ?

schröder in parliament on friday german chancellor gerhard schröder called on parliament to pave the way for early elections as he opened a debate in a no confidence motion he is hoping to lose . speaking before the bundestag on friday , schröder cited a lack of legitimation for his reform policies and conflict within his party , the spd , as the reasons for seeking new elections . " if we are to continue with this agenda , legitimation through new elections is needed , " schröder said . the chancellor is playing a dangerous game , however .
pollsters believe early elections could well put an end to his seven-year tenure . in may , schröder said he would seek early elections after his party suffered a humiliating defeat in regional elections in the traditional spd-stronghold state of north rhine-westphalia . abstention requested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's voting cards : he 's planning to choose white for abstention coalition deputies have been asked to abstain friday and schröder has said he will do the same , putting himself in the bizarre position of withholding support from his own government . opposition lawmakers , eager to take back the reins after seven years in the wilderness , will of course back the measure . if president horst köhler agrees to dissolve parliament on the basis of the no-confidence vote and call new elections in september , schröder will face a challenge from conservative opposition leader angela merkel , who aims to become germany 's first female chancellor . merkel hailed schröder 's call for parliament to be dissolved after the confidence vote , saying the country needed a new government .

" there is no plan b , " he said . friday 's vote is the second time schröder has faced a no-confidence vote before parliament . in 2001 , he called the vote to discipline members of the coalition opposed to committing german troops to the us-led war on terrorism after the sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrosso and blair " the one thing everybody in europe will agree on is that this is an interesting moment to take on the presidency of the european union , " blair told a joint news conference with european commission president jose manuel barroso . " the general task is to try to initiate , in a cooperative and inclusive way , a debate about the future direction of europe , " he said , in remarks that saw him try to take the heat out of the disputes that are plaguing the bloc . a mid-way summit to discuss the future blair , who earlier held talks with barroso and other commissioners , said britain would host a summit of eu leaders mid-way through its presidency , which would also explore social reforms . " we have agreed that it would be sensible for the presidency to hold an informal summit in the autumn at which the leaders of europe would come together and discuss how europe makes progress in the future , how we give the energy and commitment to the european project , " blair said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france categorically rejected the constitution he said the european commission would draw up a paper on europe 's social model and how it functions in a world of globalization and that leaders would discuss it during the pause for reflection announced after french and dutch voters rejected the eu 's constitution . but he categorically ruled out trying to change the treaty or better chart the troubled club 's future .
" i ca n't make progress on that in these six months , " he said . economic reform top priority in a working document for the next six months , london put economic reform at the top of its agenda , including reexamining the divisive issue of farm subsidies , which has propelled britain into a major battle with france . blair hopes to secure a deal on the 2007-2013 budget , but it remains unclear whether france in particular will be accommodating , given london 's steadfast refusal to part with its widely-detested but jealously-guarded budget rebate without an overhaul of the union 's long-term financing system . " we will do our best to make progress and to reach an agreement ; whether it is possible or not i really do n't know and neither does anyone at this stage , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders during crisis talks over the bloc 's finances earlier in june " it is important , obviously , that we try to reach an agreement , particularly after what happened at the previous summit of the european union , " he said , referring to a conclave two weeks ago that ended in failure , throwing the bloc into further strife after it ran into a crisis over its planned constitution . again trying to reach out to his partners , blair said : " i think there is less of a disagreement than people really make out . " for his part , barosso said he believed london 's presidency would be a " success " and threw his support behind blair 's agenda for reform to make europe more competitive with emerging giants such as china and india . " it 's a rough period for european politics and that is why this british presidency has a really very important responsibility . " turkey and security issues turning to other priorities in the coming months , blair highlighted future eu enlargement as well as stronger cooperation between member states on security issues such as terrorism , organised crime and illegal immigration .

rarely mentioned on these occasions are the equally , if not more impressive numbers of people who will not be tuning in .
i will be one of them .
david stubbs believes bob geldof is making a mistake with live 8 i watched live aid .
i was depressed by the mullet-headed music , that puzzling logo of a fretboard protruding from the african continent , and resented being browbeaten by multi-millionaires to empty my pockets .
and then there was the euphoria of the crowd , which reached a worrying zenith when they clapped along to queen 's radio ga-ga .
what were they feeling so victorious about ?
did they actually think that africa had been saved by david bowie 's gracious decision to appear onstage alongside status quo ?
they appeared to labour under the sort of collective , intoxicating delusion that overcomes any mass of people when they gather together and feeling triumphs over thinking .
' no sea change ' live 8 : then and now live aid had the best motives .
but to pretend this emotional , ad hoc response to the complex and chronic problem of famine in africa made a positive difference was naive , rooted in a fictional idea that rock changes the world .
it can not and it did not in 1985 .
money from live aid saved lives but , as aid expert david rieff recently argued , it may also have led to the loss of just as many lives .
there was no sea change in attitudes .
that wave of compassion did not stop millions voting for right wingers like thatcher , bush and kohl in subsequent elections .
today , africa is , if anything , worse off .
freddie mercury whipped the live aid crowd into a frenzy now we are about to go through it all again .
this time the emphasis is on debt cancellation rather than aid , but still i am sceptical .
i simply do not think it is right that ex-pop star bob geldof should be the human catalyst for one of the biggest problems facing mankind - it is beyond the wisdom of solomon , let alone geldof .
he is not up to the job .
he is making the same mistake in 2005 as he did in 1985 regarding black acts , surprising for someone so passionate about feeding africans .
his argument that the dominance of white faces among the live 8 line-up reflects the need for big names ignores the importance of symbolism in mass spectacles like this .
live aid 's legacy i am very uncomfortable , for example , at the prospect of celine dion doling out spoonfuls of pop compassion to africa 's passive hungry .
geldof has been a spectacularly tireless fundraiser .
but inevitably , given his profession , he is addicted to the spotlight and despite his reputation as a plain and profane speaker , rather too chummy towards the powerful over the years - be it prince charles , the pope , mother teresa , tony blair or george bush .
but these people front the very institutions - church , empire , western states - that can be argued have done little to alleviate african misery .
celine dion will be appearing via satellite at the canadian live 8 concert they should be interrogated , not cosied up to .
geldof 's un-punkishly conciliatory stance to these people creates the illusion that , as with the tsunami , " no one is to blame " .
ultimately , however , i will not be watching live 8 because the bill is pretty dire .
apart from the reams of has-beens and rock icons turned cabaret acts , there are the present-day brigade such as coldplay and dido , whose hugely popular yet unthreatening music signifies rock 's decline into corporate functionalism .
these people will not solve the problem .
they are the problem .
instead of watching live 8 , i will be doing something considered morbid in these emotionalist times - i am going to go upstairs and have a good think .

the cuts would reduce sanyo 's workforce by about 10 % and come as sanyo prepares to restructure to tackle losses , newspaper nihon keizai shimbun reports .
last year , weak sales of digital cameras and mobile phones pushed losses to 171.54bn yen -lrb- $ 1.55bn ; £ 860m -rrb- .
shares in the company gained 2.5 % on the news as investors expressed confidence in sanyo 's turn-around plan .
new management team sanyo plans to spend 56bn yen to reorganise its business , including the move of staff from loss-making divisions into more promising areas like solar panels and rechargeable batteries .
a further 10bn yen will be spent to reduce its asset holdings and 24bn yen will go towards paying for redundancies and other employee-related expenses .
sanyo 's new management team , headed by chief executive tomoyo nonaka and president toshimasa iue , is expected to reveal further details of its restructuring strategy on 5 july .

the project , covering the whole of the uk , has been designed by the bhf care and education research group at the university of york .

the us textile and sugar industries and us trade unions have opposed the deal .
but president george w bush insisted it is " good for american workers , good for our farmers and good for small businesses " .
five countries in the region have signed up to cafta , which will aim to help ease poverty , foster development and strengthen democracy in the region .
" the agreement is also a strong boost for young democracies in our own hemisphere whose success is important for america 's national security and for reducing illegal immigration , " bush added .
weak labour laws the us senate voted 54-45 in favour of the trade agreement which will next be considered by the us house of representatives .
those in favour say us exports of both agricultural produce and manufactured goods to the region should rise .
cafta signatories costa rica el salvador guatemala nicaragua dominican republic yet the us sugar and textile industries fear job losses could result from tough competition from countries where workers ' rights are poorly protected .
" there is only one labour provision in cafta that is enforceable ; a nation 's commitment to enforce its own laws , " said senator john kerry .
" that sounds good , " he said , " but in reality this provision does nothing to protect workers . "
the bush administration has responded to such criticism by pledging extra funding to help cafta countries protect workers and the environment .
the participating countries are costa rica , el salvador , guatemala , honduras , nicaragua and the dominican republic .

the department of transport says changing the road signs to include the tribute would confuse drivers .
it said it understood how many fans feel about brian clough , who coached nottingham forest and derby county .
but too many words on a sign could prove difficult to read and could lead to an accident .
one fan , dave coxon from beeston , nottingham said : " by naming the a52 by a name i do not think it would confuse in the slightest .
" i did a bit of research and i 've found sir matt busby way , sir alf ramsey way and sir tom finney way .
" i 've no idea what size roads they are but they 're all pretty famous footballers and managers , so why not ? "
" it 's very disappointing ...
it sounds to me as though somebody is misunderstanding what is required " andy taylor , fan in a statement officials said : " we 're not against the idea of renaming the road and we understand the strength of local feeling on the matter . "
but they said it would be against national policy to add an extra board to the route signs .
" the reason is that too many words on a sign can be confusing , and it takes longer for drivers to read .
" this could lead to an accident . "

fee-charging machines will have to display on screen how much the customer is being charged for a cash withdrawal .

but critics of fee-charging machines say that the rules do n't go far enough .
charges spread " day by day consumers ' right to access cash for free is being eroded by the rapid growth in charging machines " charles reed , nationwide consumer groups have expressed concern about the spread of fee-charging cash machines .
there are currently more than 54,000 cash machines in the uk , four out of ten of which charge a fee .
consumers now pay £ 140m a year to access their own money .
a few years ago , only a handful of machines charged a fee .
consumer groups and campaigners have called for a cap to be imposed on fees and the spread of fee-charging machines to be halted .
" day by day consumers ' right to access cash for free is being eroded by the rapid growth in charging machines and by the fact that there is no cap on the charges , " charles reed , director at the nationwide building society , said .
at the same time as the new rules came into force , fee-charging cash machine provider moneybox unveiled plans to expand its network .
about two-thirds of the group 's 3,000 cash machines are currently in convenience stores .
the firm said it planned to roll out cash machines in free-standing kiosks in busy locations , such as shopping centres .

the london eye is covered because it was considered a large scale protest could still obstruct access to parliament because of its position over westminster bridge , she said .

the 24-hour channel , itv , or the indigenous television network , will broadcast a mix of news and features .
the channel aims to focus on aboriginal communities .
aboriginal groups , who account for less than 2 % of taiwan 's population , have long complained the mainstream media either neglects or misrepresents them .
they see the new channel as a historic chance for their own voices to be heard , not just in taiwan but around the world through collaboration with other indigenous television programmes .
the 12 aboriginal tribes in taiwan , who trace their roots back 6,000 years , have their own traditions and languages , although the new station will mainly broadcast in mandarin chinese .
because many aboriginal groups live in remote mountainous regions , the cabinet-level council of indigenous peoples has installed thousands of homes with satellite television transmitters so that communities can access the station .
the aboriginal channel is not the first in taiwan with ethnic content .
two years ago the government launched a station dedicated to the island 's larger hakka community , who migrated to taiwan from mainland china several centuries ago .
the initiatives are part of efforts by the government to promote multi-culturalism in taiwan .

" it 's just an outstanding day to be this close to getting the shuttle flying again , " nasa launch director michael leinbach told reporters on thursday at the end of a two-day flight review .
" it 's a great , great feeling . "
but earlier this week , a panel monitoring the return to flight said the agency had failed to meet three of 15 recommendations made by the columbia accident investigation board -lrb- caib -rrb- for the safe resumption of shuttle journeys .
but nasa administrator michael griffin said discovery was fit for launch .
" based on a very thorough and very successful flight readiness review , we 're currently ' go for launch ' of discovery on 13 july , " he announced .
discovery 's seven-member crew , headed by veteran astronaut eileen collins , arrives at the florida spaceport for final flight preparations on 10 july .
rescue options before the columbia accident in february 2003 , much of the tension associated with sending a shuttle into orbit dissipated after a successful launch .
but the columbia disaster demonstrated that any stage of the mission carries great risks .
columbia and its crew of seven perished as they flew home for landing , the result of undetected damage from a debris impact during lift-off that had no effect on the ship in space .
since that day , nasa has doggedly pursued as many options as possible to prevent debris impacts , detect damage and develop back-up plans for saving the crew even if the ship can not return to earth .
although managers pledged that discovery will be the safest shuttle launched to date , there will be no victory dance until the vehicle is safely back on the ground .
" i personally do n't think we 're going to be doing any celebrating until we have wheels stop on the landing , " dr griffin said .
the associate administrator for space operations , william readdy , added : " the celebration is n't about weighing anchor .
the -lsb- celebration -rsb- is about when discovery 's at anchor after a successful mission . "
relief mission discovery is to spend a week at the international space station , which has been operating one crew member short since nasa grounded the shuttle fleet for repairs .
the shuttle will not only be delivering much-needed supplies , it will also ferry a new gyroscope , which is part of the outpost 's fuel-free steering system .
launching in the middle of the afternoon will be a real challenge nasa launch director michael leinbach nasa says , however , the primary purpose of the mission is to test how well the safety upgrades implemented after the columbia accident perform in orbit .
a second test flight is targeted to follow in september .

police can now order protesters who target employees of animal research companies at their homes to leave and not return within three months .
there are also tougher powers to protect individuals against harassment .
a new offence of " harassment intended to deter lawful activities " has been created as part of the serious organised crime and police act .
the uk pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry provides " more than 22,000 jobs and -lsb- is -rsb- worth more than £ 3.6 billion in the uk , " said trade and industry secretary alan johnson . "
the challenge now is to ensure that the police and the judiciary have the resources they need to implement these new laws " aisling burnand chief executive of bioindustry " companies have the right to conduct legitimate business free from fear of being attacked , " he added .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the activities of animal rights extremists endangered vital research into cancer , hiv / aids and alzheimer 's disease .
while protesters have the right to campaign lawfully against the use of animals in scientific research , home office minister paul goggins said : " they do not have the right to engage in acts of intimidation or violence against individuals and firms working in this area . "
call for police huntingdon life sciences , long a target of extremists , welcomed the tougher laws but called for sufficient police resources to implement them .
director brian cass said : " i continue to be encouraged by the robust and determined position that the government is taking to control animal rights extremists . "
the measures were also welcomed by the chief executive of bioindustry , aisling burnand .
" this legislation will serve to eliminate the grey area in which animal extremists have previously operated , and will protect companies and individuals engaged in legitimate , groundbreaking bioscience research in this country and , crucially , all those connected with the research .
" the challenge now is to ensure that the police and the judiciary have the resources they need to implement these new laws . "
' serious threat ' a spokesman for anti-vivisection campaign speak said the law was " ambiguous and open-ended " .
" it is encouraging people to go down the road of illegal activity , because when you restrict a person 's democratic right to protest then they will have not other option , " robert cogswell said , while emphasising that the speak campaign operated legally .
the british union of the abolition of vivisection said it was concerned the measures " will constitute a serious threat to freedom of expression for anyone who opposes animal experiments making it an offence , for example , to cause economic damage " .
it asked : " could this mean that exerting economic pressure will be illegal for anti-vivisectionists , however peacefully and reasonably they behave ? "

police can now order protesters who target employees of animal research companies at their homes to leave and not return within three months .
there are also tougher powers to protect individuals against harassment .
a new offence of " harassment intended to deter lawful activities " has been created as part of the serious organised crime and police act .
the uk pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry provides " more than 22,000 jobs and -lsb- is -rsb- worth more than £ 3.6 billion in the uk , " said trade and industry secretary alan johnson .
the challenge now is to ensure that the police and the judiciary have the resources they need to implement these new laws aisling burnand chief executive of bioindustry " companies have the right to conduct legitimate business free from fear of being attacked , " he added .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the activities of animal rights extremists endangered vital research into cancer , hiv / aids and alzheimer 's disease .
while protesters have the right to campaign lawfully against the use of animals in scientific research , home office minister paul goggins said : " they do not have the right to engage in acts of intimidation or violence against individuals and firms working in this area . "
call for police huntingdon life sciences , long a target of extremists , welcomed the tougher laws but called for sufficient police resources to implement them .
director brian cass said : " i continue to be encouraged by the robust and determined position that the government is taking to control animal rights extremists . "
the measures were also welcomed by the chief executive of bioindustry , aisling burnand .
" this legislation will serve to eliminate the grey area in which animal extremists have previously operated , and will protect companies and individuals engaged in legitimate , groundbreaking bioscience research in this country and , crucially , all those connected with the research .

spain 's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages , making it the fourth country in the world to do so .
the spanish bill will become law in a month 's time , putting same-sex and heterosexual marriages on the same legal footing including the right to adopt children .
do you approve of same-sex marriage ?
would you consider travelling to either belgium , canada , the netherlands or spain to get married ?
should gay couples have the same rights as heterosexuals ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages balaji , chennai , india first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages .
let the world stop forcing its religious views upon the larger community .
balaji , chennai , india regardless of whether i am comfortable with homosexuality or not , i feel very strongly that it is none of my business how other people live their lives , especially their sex lives .
what really makes me cringe is when a group of people are denied their right to pursue happiness because they do not fit into the stereotypical mythical , white , christian 1950 's family unit complete with stay-at-home mom and all-knowing , strong , law-giving dad .
the constitution never specified freedom and equality only " within the boundaries of the christian conservative church " .
rhonda , houston , tx , usa to those who reject gay marriage on the basis of gay couples not being able to reproduce : what about heterosexual couples who can not or will not have children ?
should they be denied marriage also ?
mikko , finland the time appears to have come for gay marriages to be recognised more and more .
not only are nations increasingly recognising what 's natural and right but our church has decided at the atlanta convention to support gay marriage .
i 'm proud to be a part of my congregational church which is open and affirming in its views and i look forward to hearing from our minister when she returns .
dale lanan , longmont , colorado , usa i totally agree with civil marriage between homosexuals .
i know of a gay couple who were ' disowned ' by their parents when they decided to live together .
but when one of them fell ill and died , all of a sudden his family came to claim his possessions .
in a heterosexual marriage all that would belong to the spouse , but his partner was left with nothing and still is paying off debt from the medical costs from his partner 's illness .
i strongly believe in human rights and equality for all peoples and hope that very soon many more people will accept and embrace one another 's beliefs and rights .
fraiser , thailand as far as it is a civil marriage , there is no problem .
but it should not in anyway lead to child adoption .
it is a matter of human right and a child has the full right to have a mother and a father .
chadi , lebanon i love my country but it 's sad that the united states is so far behind when it comes to treating everyone as equal .
homosexuals , african americans , latinos , asians , jews , muslims , people with disabilities and anyone else considered ' different ' will know where i 'm coming from .
our country still holds the greatest influence in the world and i ask everyone to pray for our nation and our world in times of challenges between social and international issues that can impact our globe .
walter g , palm harbor , florida we are not against civil unions for homosexuals , i mean , they have to have exactly the same rights than heterosexuals in paying taxes -lrb- here in spain you can pay taxes on your own or with your couple -rrb- , widowed pension , and all civil rights you have just for marrying .
we are against the word " matrimonio " in spanish , just because the word includes " matri " that means mother , and they ca n't be mothers , so why do n't they just call it civil unions ?
they say that that involves an implicit discrimination , but i do n't think so , is just calling things by its own name .
aurelio de la puerta , seville , spain my partner , who 's british , and i are one of the 5,000 couples queuing up to marry in spain .
pm zapatero should be applauded for his progressive stance while other leaders in so-called more liberal northern europe shy away from allowing full equality .
i 'd add that it seems strange to take moral authority from the catholic church , an institution that has failed to address the issue of paedophile priests effectively , while its stand against the use of condoms has caused the deaths of millions of people from aids in africa .
aleksandar atanasov , malaga , spain in my opinion , the matter of same-sex marriages would not have been such a trouble if the religious right and similar people in europe had not made it a huge issue .
so members of non-heterosexual minorities want to marry each other ?
let them .
they regard it as a right , when their opponents would like to rid them of all rights -lrb- including health care -rrb- .
v lehtinen , tampere , finland gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide .
in the united states , the government champions equality , but does not follow through .
it is important that gays join african-americans and women in being liberated and being treated as equals .
gays are people too , and deserve to be treated as such .
becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states i understand both sides of this issue .
however , at the end of the day it is all about equality .
the religious right has to understand that stripping one group of their rights leads to a slippery slope that will one day have them stripped of theirs .
let 's be reasonable and fair to all .
i live as an equal .
i am a canadian !
michael talon , toronto , on , canada i believe couples with children carry the weight of a country by creating taxpayers etc .
homosexual couples can not give birth to children thus should not be allowed to have normal marriage rights .
this does not mean they are not human , it 's different .
john , melbourne we can not go on with such closed minds ! !
i know several gay couples and they all seem more committed to each other than most heterosexual couples .
they should have the same rights as anyone else .
they have the same emotions and the want for company that any human does .
gay people are not monsters , they are just like you and me and should not be persecuted like so many minorities are and have been throughout history .
zoe , hertfordshire , uk homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa < homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do , and there is no justification for opinions that state otherwise .
the purpose of marriage is to allow two people that love each other to be united in a beautiful bond , and this should not be denied to those whose sexual preferences are different from the majority .
cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa first they say that gays are too promiscuous .
then they get upset when we want to get married in a committed relationship .
religious fanatics seem so confused .
bernie , denver , co , usa we 're not talking about a church service but a civil marriage .
gays like any people have their civil rights like any other member of society .
roger pacheco , san francisco , usa it is to be expected that in an age of individualism coupled with rejection of universal morality that " gay marriage " should become increasingly acceptable .
in the long haul of history it is a sign of social and cultural decay .
william miller , kansas city , mo , usa why should any country hold a referendum on this issue ?
why should any majority have the right to decide on the human rights of any minority that is not breaking the law ?
there would still be segregation in the usa if the people there had had a referendum on racial equality in the 1960 's .
stephen , belfast ni the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed emily fogarty , smithfield , ri i can not believe this is happening .
it 's purely unnatural .
the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed .
emily fogarty , smithfield , ri to those who cry for national referendums and mandates from the electorate , i say this : basic human and civil rights are meant to protect minorities against majority oppression , not the other way around .
honestly , america 's brain drain will be canada 's gain .
if our country can not provide its citizens with the protections they need and deserve , expect nothing less than a mass exodus .
hopping the border is looking increasingly attractive ...
ellen , cincinnati , oh , usa reading many of the comments it seems that many parents are raising their children to believe that the love between gay couples is worth less than that between a man and a woman .
what nonsense .
also , gay people are n't trying to hijack a religious ceremony .
they are trying to enjoy the civil unions already afforded to straight couples .
why is there so much bitterness over the right for people in love to express themselves ?
david s , london , uk same sex marriage is about human rights .
arguments against this are simply prejudice and hatred disguised by religion and tradition .
christopher borycheski , toronto , canada whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant dean , boston , ma , usa whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant .
that should not preclude people around the world from enjoying equal rights and protections given to everybody else .
most opponents of gay marriage behave as if it would be mandatory and use the unbelievably selfish argument , " i do n't like this so you ca n't do it . "
these opponents of equality have no concept of what a free society is all about and will one day be ashamed of their backwards and bigoted views .
i 'm proud my state allows gay marriage , and big cheers for canada and spain !
dean , boston , ma , usa as a married woman with two children , i congratulate canada for allowing others - sisters and brothers - to share in the same depth of relationship which i fortunately enjoy .
shame to all those who prohibit others from love and life .
annette , philadelphia pa free will and equal rights .
if a gay couple wants to be married it is strictly their business .
no one tries to stop and no one argues the validity of a heterosexual couple 's marriage and as far as adoption goes , with so many children out there waiting to become part of a loving home , the more couples willing to adopt the better .
live and let live .
no one should take satisfaction in destroying another person 's chance at expressing their love in a permanent honourable fashion .
romee trofort , alexandria , va us equality and discrimination should be abolished wherever possible - if this includes giving full marriage rights to same sex partners then same sex marriage should be available and be open in as many places as possible .
thomas kubot , netherlands this is a slap in the face on my belief structure rodolfo , cincinnati , usa sad , very sad .
this is a slap in the face on my belief structure .
how can i teach my kids what is right if the world says what i believe is wrong ?
this is the impact of gay marriage .
rodolfo , cincinnati , usa congrats on passing your new law and showing the world that you stand for all human rights !
i wish our country would do the same .
i admire you all greatly !
congratulations !
gene , andover , minn . , usa it 's an important moment , knowing that when i finally fall in love , i 'll be able to solemnize our relationship like any other couple .
i 'm proud of our politicians for taking a step forward .
tim , toronto , canada i do n't see why any country recognizes marriage in the first place .
after all a separation of church and state should mean that the state would recognize only civil unions -lrb- which would be between all type hetero or homosexual couples -rrb- .
tristan benson , richmond , va .
deeply saddened by the politics and ethics that lead to this decision that hardly reflects the wishes or viewpoint of the majority of canadians .
it is not merely the conservative religious segment of canadian society , but also many ethnic cultural groups that are disapproving of this redefinition of the word " marriage " .
lisa , cambridge , canada last night was a great moment for canada and for the rest of the world .
thanks to all mps who voted in favour of the bill and to all other people who worked for this over the years !
spain will hopefully follow the lead later this week .
sami , helsinki , finland i 'm proud to be a canadian today !
s. terra , winnipeg manitoba canada congratulations canada !
it must be great living in a country where everyone is equal .
paul , bellingham , wa usa i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship patrick , madison , wisconsin , us canada has once again come to the forefront , while the united states , that bastion of " freedom " , is ready to do the opposite .
i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship .
if you disagree or disapprove , that is what your voice , your church , and your living room is for , but dissenters should not be allowed to take me away from my partner , bar me from his bedside , or prevent us from caring for each other , physically , spiritually , or financially .
patrick , madison , wisconsin , us i think this is an amazing day for us and the rest of the country , i can finally marry the one i love .
raymond parker , dieppe nb the orientation i was born with is heterosexual .
because this is " approved " i could be married anywhere .
but , if i marry again , i want to marry in canada where all persons have rights .
jim lawson , leonard ok , usa the passage of this bill does not reflect the values of the typical canadian .
if parliament had had the courage to submit this to a national referendum there is no doubt that it would have gone down to a resounding defeat .
pete , vancouver , canada i see nothing but positive coming from this .
gays and lesbians no longer have to suffer the heartbreaking issues that they had to endure by not having equal standing .
i am sure that the straight population will see that we have not lost anything and we have allowed people dignity .
i am overjoyed !
greg pressey , tillsonburg , canada this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities thom , montreal , canada this is a logical next step in the evolution of modern society .
homosexuals in canada have been waiting since 1967 -lrb- when homosexuality was decriminalized -rrb- for this day .
this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities .
i am from quebec and advocate the separation of this province from the rest of the country , but on a day like today i ca n't help but feel proud to live in canada .
thom seivewright , montreal , canada i think this is excellent !
honestly , what 's so wrong about gay people getting married ?
they 're not hurting anyone .
as for the ' true definition of marriage ' i think that 's a joke , what with shows like ' marry my dad ' how can they say that with a straight face ?
theresa , ontario , canada i have to say this is news that makes my heart happy .
people need to realize that true equality goes across the board - marriage should be for all , not just heterosexuals .
this is a step in the right direction !
usa , are you paying attention ?
peter , east greenwich , rhode island , usa being canadian , i am proud of the politicians who sided with freedom of choice and the people 's wish .
intolerance and despotism have no place in politic in a civilized world .
michel tremblay , canada it 's a matter of equal rights and balancing minority rights against the greater population .
it does n't affect my wife 's and my marriage in any way at all .
perhaps those who are so offended by it can now put their attention to canada 's high divorce rate -lrb- among heterosexual couples of course -rrb- .
gary , nelson , canada as a canadian living in england with my english partner of 5 years , we 're both proud to wave the canadian flag today !
canada is now a shining example to america and the rest of the world of the true and proper way to recognise the rights of all people , and not just those who follow an established religious code of ethics .
as prime minister paul martin has said , equal rights for minority groups is not something you can simply pick and choose .
r. fraser , london , uk we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage edward , london i 've been living with my canadian partner for over 10 years now and i welcome this legislation .
it means we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage , rather than put up with the second class " civil partnership " which the government is introducing here .
edward , london ca n't believe our politicians spent so much time on this issue !
i 'm definitely not against equal rights for gay couples but no matter what the politicians say , to me marriage will always be a union between a man and a woman .
mark , ottawa , canada as much as the religious right complain , i do n't see this having any impact on heterosexual couples , married or otherwise .
the facts are that parliament would have had to invoke the not withstanding clause to take a different course and what would that mean for gay couples that have already married after the high courts found that this was a charter of rights issue ?
personally i think the " live and let live " motto works for me and i would remind the religious right that the same charter protects their rights to practise whatever religion they want .
they are a lot bigger issues facing canadian society that deserve our attention .
mack , ottawa , canada congratulations canada .
spain is next and hopefully many countries will follow .
about time gay people were treated equal .
ricardo yerro , pamplona , spain equality at last ! ! !
this was never a simple debate about a word .
this was : for all of those people who have been beaten to death simply for being who they are ; for all of those people who have taken their own lives , either as young people afraid of what they were feeling , or others in heterosexual marriages and not knowing what to do with their truth -lrb- and there are far , far too many of these people -rrb- ; for all of those people who marched " before it was popular " and were greeted by rocks and sticks instead of cheers .
for anyone , anywhere who faces inequality , bigotry and prejudice , this is a victory for all of us who would fight against those trying to deny us what they have so comfortably enjoyed for years .
i am personally overwhelmed , and fiercely proud to be a canadian this morning !
len t milley , toronto , canada i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed t. mooney , oakville , ontario the liberal minority government had no mandate from the canadian electorate to pass this bill .
i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed .
t. mooney , oakville , ontario at least in canada , all citizens are truly created equal .
i celebrate my 20th anniversary with my husband this coming week -lrb- yes , we 're gay -rrb- .
if finances and circumstances were different , a trip to canada would have been lovely !
at least our neighbours to the north have it right .
god bless them and god bless canada ! ! !
clay dove , dallas , tx , usa as much as i was against this bill and still am , please politicians can we just get on with running the country ?
i am sure that there are more important issues that deserve to take up just as much of your valuable time and need as much passion and debate .
susan chambers , oshawa , ontario , canada i 've no doubt that there will be howls of protest over this but in a truly fair and equal secular society it is perfectly right that gay men and women should have the right to an officially recognised life bond and the term marriage is as good as any who knows they might take it more seriously than a large number of heterosexuals do !
tim , plymouth , uk this is a proud moment for canada and the world .
it also offers another example of how to build an open and inclusive democratic society in contrast to the high state of fear and anxiety demonstrated by our neighbours to the south .
america needs us more than their leaders know .
tom , ottawa , canada this is dark day for canadian families .
polls indicate that a national referendum would show more than 70 % of canadians oppose the bill , and want to leave marriage as between a man and a woman .
james , freelton , on , canada fantastic !
hurrah !
canadians had it right when they said they were welcoming and inclusive .
perhaps the other north american country can learn to follow suit .
what a day for celebration that would be .

aleksandar atanasov , malaga , spain in my opinion , the matter of same-sex marriages would not have been such a trouble if the religious right and similar people in europe had not made it a huge issue .
so members of non-heterosexual minorities want to marry each other ?
let them .
they regard it as a right , when their opponents would like to rid them of all rights -lrb- including health care -rrb- .
v lehtinen , tampere , finland gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide .
in the united states , the government champions equality , but does not follow through .
it is important that gays join african-americans and women in being liberated and being treated as equals .
gays are people too , and deserve to be treated as such .
becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states i understand both sides of this issue .
however , at the end of the day it is all about equality .
the religious right has to understand that stripping one group of their rights leads to a slippery slope that will one day have them stripped of theirs .
let 's be reasonable and fair to all .
i live as an equal .
i am a canadian !
michael talon , toronto , on , canada i believe couples with children carry the weight of a country by creating taxpayers etc .
homosexual couples can not give birth to children thus should not be allowed to have normal marriage rights .
this does not mean they are not human , it 's different .
john , melbourne we can not go on with such closed minds ! !
i know several gay couples and they all seem more committed to each other than most heterosexual couples .
they should have the same rights as anyone else .
they have the same emotions and the want for company that any human does .
gay people are not monsters , they are just like you and me and should not be persecuted like so many minorities are and have been throughout history .
zoe , hertfordshire , uk homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa < homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do , and there is no justification for opinions that state otherwise .
the purpose of marriage is to allow two people that love each other to be united in a beautiful bond , and this should not be denied to those whose sexual preferences are different from the majority .
cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa first they say that gays are too promiscuous .
then they get upset when we want to get married in a committed relationship .
religious fanatics seem so confused .
bernie , denver , co , usa we 're not talking about a church service but a civil marriage .
gays like any people have their civil rights like any other member of society .
roger pacheco , san francisco , usa it is to be expected that in an age of individualism coupled with rejection of universal morality that " gay marriage " should become increasingly acceptable .
in the long haul of history it is a sign of social and cultural decay .
william miller , kansas city , mo , usa why should any country hold a referendum on this issue ?
why should any majority have the right to decide on the human rights of any minority that is not breaking the law ?
there would still be segregation in the usa if the people there had had a referendum on racial equality in the 1960 's .
stephen , belfast ni the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed emily fogarty , smithfield , ri i can not believe this is happening .
it 's purely unnatural .
the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed .
emily fogarty , smithfield , ri to those who cry for national referendums and mandates from the electorate , i say this : basic human and civil rights are meant to protect minorities against majority oppression , not the other way around .
honestly , america 's brain drain will be canada 's gain .
if our country can not provide its citizens with the protections they need and deserve , expect nothing less than a mass exodus .
hopping the border is looking increasingly attractive ...
ellen , cincinnati , oh , usa reading many of the comments it seems that many parents are raising their children to believe that the love between gay couples is worth less than that between a man and a woman .
what nonsense .
also , gay people are n't trying to hijack a religious ceremony .
they are trying to enjoy the civil unions already afforded to straight couples .
why is there so much bitterness over the right for people in love to express themselves ?
david s , london , uk same sex marriage is about human rights .
arguments against this are simply prejudice and hatred disguised by religion and tradition .
christopher borycheski , toronto , canada whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant dean , boston , ma , usa whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant .
that should not preclude people around the world from enjoying equal rights and protections given to everybody else .
most opponents of gay marriage behave as if it would be mandatory and use the unbelievably selfish argument , " i do n't like this so you ca n't do it . "
these opponents of equality have no concept of what a free society is all about and will one day be ashamed of their backwards and bigoted views .
i 'm proud my state allows gay marriage , and big cheers for canada and spain !
dean , boston , ma , usa as a married woman with two children , i congratulate canada for allowing others - sisters and brothers - to share in the same depth of relationship which i fortunately enjoy .
shame to all those who prohibit others from love and life .
annette , philadelphia pa free will and equal rights .
if a gay couple wants to be married it is strictly their business .
no one tries to stop and no one argues the validity of a heterosexual couple 's marriage and as far as adoption goes , with so many children out there waiting to become part of a loving home , the more couples willing to adopt the better .
live and let live .
no one should take satisfaction in destroying another person 's chance at expressing their love in a permanent honourable fashion .
romee trofort , alexandria , va us equality and discrimination should be abolished wherever possible - if this includes giving full marriage rights to same sex partners then same sex marriage should be available and be open in as many places as possible .
thomas kubot , netherlands this is a slap in the face on my belief structure rodolfo , cincinnati , usa sad , very sad .
this is a slap in the face on my belief structure .
how can i teach my kids what is right if the world says what i believe is wrong ?
this is the impact of gay marriage .
rodolfo , cincinnati , usa congrats on passing your new law and showing the world that you stand for all human rights !
i wish our country would do the same .
i admire you all greatly !
congratulations !
gene , andover , minn . , usa it 's an important moment , knowing that when i finally fall in love , i 'll be able to solemnize our relationship like any other couple .
i 'm proud of our politicians for taking a step forward .
tim , toronto , canada i do n't see why any country recognizes marriage in the first place .
after all a separation of church and state should mean that the state would recognize only civil unions -lrb- which would be between all type hetero or homosexual couples -rrb- .
tristan benson , richmond , va .
deeply saddened by the politics and ethics that lead to this decision that hardly reflects the wishes or viewpoint of the majority of canadians .
it is not merely the conservative religious segment of canadian society , but also many ethnic cultural groups that are disapproving of this redefinition of the word " marriage " .
lisa , cambridge , canada last night was a great moment for canada and for the rest of the world .
thanks to all mps who voted in favour of the bill and to all other people who worked for this over the years !
spain will hopefully follow the lead later this week .
sami , helsinki , finland i 'm proud to be a canadian today !
s. terra , winnipeg manitoba canada congratulations canada !
it must be great living in a country where everyone is equal .
paul , bellingham , wa usa i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship patrick , madison , wisconsin , us canada has once again come to the forefront , while the united states , that bastion of " freedom " , is ready to do the opposite .
i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship .
if you disagree or disapprove , that is what your voice , your church , and your living room is for , but dissenters should not be allowed to take me away from my partner , bar me from his bedside , or prevent us from caring for each other , physically , spiritually , or financially .
patrick , madison , wisconsin , us i think this is an amazing day for us and the rest of the country , i can finally marry the one i love .
raymond parker , dieppe nb the orientation i was born with is heterosexual .
because this is " approved " i could be married anywhere .
but , if i marry again , i want to marry in canada where all persons have rights .
jim lawson , leonard ok , usa the passage of this bill does not reflect the values of the typical canadian .
if parliament had had the courage to submit this to a national referendum there is no doubt that it would have gone down to a resounding defeat .
pete , vancouver , canada i see nothing but positive coming from this .
gays and lesbians no longer have to suffer the heartbreaking issues that they had to endure by not having equal standing .
i am sure that the straight population will see that we have not lost anything and we have allowed people dignity .
i am overjoyed !
greg pressey , tillsonburg , canada this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities thom , montreal , canada this is a logical next step in the evolution of modern society .
homosexuals in canada have been waiting since 1967 -lrb- when homosexuality was decriminalized -rrb- for this day .
this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities .
i am from quebec and advocate the separation of this province from the rest of the country , but on a day like today i ca n't help but feel proud to live in canada .
thom seivewright , montreal , canada i think this is excellent !
honestly , what 's so wrong about gay people getting married ?
they 're not hurting anyone .
as for the ' true definition of marriage ' i think that 's a joke , what with shows like ' marry my dad ' how can they say that with a straight face ?
theresa , ontario , canada i have to say this is news that makes my heart happy .
people need to realize that true equality goes across the board - marriage should be for all , not just heterosexuals .
this is a step in the right direction !
usa , are you paying attention ?
peter , east greenwich , rhode island , usa being canadian , i am proud of the politicians who sided with freedom of choice and the people 's wish .
intolerance and despotism have no place in politic in a civilized world .
michel tremblay , canada it 's a matter of equal rights and balancing minority rights against the greater population .
it does n't affect my wife 's and my marriage in any way at all .
perhaps those who are so offended by it can now put their attention to canada 's high divorce rate -lrb- among heterosexual couples of course -rrb- .
gary , nelson , canada as a canadian living in england with my english partner of 5 years , we 're both proud to wave the canadian flag today !
canada is now a shining example to america and the rest of the world of the true and proper way to recognise the rights of all people , and not just those who follow an established religious code of ethics .
as prime minister paul martin has said , equal rights for minority groups is not something you can simply pick and choose .
r. fraser , london , uk we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage edward , london i 've been living with my canadian partner for over 10 years now and i welcome this legislation .
it means we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage , rather than put up with the second class " civil partnership " which the government is introducing here .
edward , london ca n't believe our politicians spent so much time on this issue !
i 'm definitely not against equal rights for gay couples but no matter what the politicians say , to me marriage will always be a union between a man and a woman .
mark , ottawa , canada as much as the religious right complain , i do n't see this having any impact on heterosexual couples , married or otherwise .
the facts are that parliament would have had to invoke the not withstanding clause to take a different course and what would that mean for gay couples that have already married after the high courts found that this was a charter of rights issue ?
personally i think the " live and let live " motto works for me and i would remind the religious right that the same charter protects their rights to practise whatever religion they want .
they are a lot bigger issues facing canadian society that deserve our attention .
mack , ottawa , canada congratulations canada .
spain is next and hopefully many countries will follow .
about time gay people were treated equal .
ricardo yerro , pamplona , spain equality at last ! ! !
this was never a simple debate about a word .
this was : for all of those people who have been beaten to death simply for being who they are ; for all of those people who have taken their own lives , either as young people afraid of what they were feeling , or others in heterosexual marriages and not knowing what to do with their truth -lrb- and there are far , far too many of these people -rrb- ; for all of those people who marched " before it was popular " and were greeted by rocks and sticks instead of cheers .
for anyone , anywhere who faces inequality , bigotry and prejudice , this is a victory for all of us who would fight against those trying to deny us what they have so comfortably enjoyed for years .
i am personally overwhelmed , and fiercely proud to be a canadian this morning !
len t milley , toronto , canada i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed t. mooney , oakville , ontario the liberal minority government had no mandate from the canadian electorate to pass this bill .
i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed .
t. mooney , oakville , ontario at least in canada , all citizens are truly created equal .
i celebrate my 20th anniversary with my husband this coming week -lrb- yes , we 're gay -rrb- .
if finances and circumstances were different , a trip to canada would have been lovely !
at least our neighbours to the north have it right .
god bless them and god bless canada ! ! !
clay dove , dallas , tx , usa as much as i was against this bill and still am , please politicians can we just get on with running the country ?
i am sure that there are more important issues that deserve to take up just as much of your valuable time and need as much passion and debate .
susan chambers , oshawa , ontario , canada i 've no doubt that there will be howls of protest over this but in a truly fair and equal secular society it is perfectly right that gay men and women should have the right to an officially recognised life bond and the term marriage is as good as any who knows they might take it more seriously than a large number of heterosexuals do !
tim , plymouth , uk this is a proud moment for canada and the world .
it also offers another example of how to build an open and inclusive democratic society in contrast to the high state of fear and anxiety demonstrated by our neighbours to the south .
america needs us more than their leaders know .
tom , ottawa , canada this is dark day for canadian families .
polls indicate that a national referendum would show more than 70 % of canadians oppose the bill , and want to leave marriage as between a man and a woman .
james , freelton , on , canada fantastic !
hurrah !
canadians had it right when they said they were welcoming and inclusive .
perhaps the other north american country can learn to follow suit .
what a day for celebration that would be .

spain 's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages , making it the fourth country in the world to do so .
the spanish bill will become law in a month 's time , putting same-sex and heterosexual marriages on the same legal footing including the right to adopt children .
do you approve of same-sex marriage ?
would you consider travelling to either belgium , canada , the netherlands or spain to get married ?
should gay couples have the same rights as heterosexuals ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages balaji , chennai , india first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages .
let the world stop forcing its religious views upon the larger community .
balaji , chennai , india regardless of whether i am comfortable with homosexuality or not , i feel very strongly that it is none of my business how other people live their lives , especially their sex lives .
what really makes me cringe is when a group of people are denied their right to pursue happiness because they do not fit into the stereotypical mythical , white , christian 1950 's family unit complete with stay-at-home mom and all-knowing , strong , law-giving dad .
the constitution never specified freedom and equality only " within the boundaries of the christian conservative church " .
rhonda , houston , tx , usa to those who reject gay marriage on the basis of gay couples not being able to reproduce : what about heterosexual couples who can not or will not have children ?
should they be denied marriage also ?
mikko , finland the time appears to have come for gay marriages to be recognised more and more .
not only are nations increasingly recognising what 's natural and right but our church has decided at the atlanta convention to support gay marriage .
i 'm proud to be a part of my congregational church which is open and affirming in its views and i look forward to hearing from our minister when she returns .
dale lanan , longmont , colorado , usa i totally agree with civil marriage between homosexuals .
i know of a gay couple who were ' disowned ' by their parents when they decided to live together .
but when one of them fell ill and died , all of a sudden his family came to claim his possessions .
in a heterosexual marriage all that would belong to the spouse , but his partner was left with nothing and still is paying off debt from the medical costs from his partner 's illness .
i strongly believe in human rights and equality for all peoples and hope that very soon many more people will accept and embrace one another 's beliefs and rights .
fraiser , thailand as far as it is a civil marriage , there is no problem .
but it should not in anyway lead to child adoption .
it is a matter of human right and a child has the full right to have a mother and a father .
chadi , lebanon i love my country but it 's sad that the united states is so far behind when it comes to treating everyone as equal .
homosexuals , african americans , latinos , asians , jews , muslims , people with disabilities and anyone else considered ' different ' will know where i 'm coming from .
our country still holds the greatest influence in the world and i ask everyone to pray for our nation and our world in times of challenges between social and international issues that can impact our globe .
walter g , palm harbor , florida we are not against civil unions for homosexuals , i mean , they have to have exactly the same rights than heterosexuals in paying taxes -lrb- here in spain you can pay taxes on your own or with your couple -rrb- , widowed pension , and all civil rights you have just for marrying .
we are against the word " matrimonio " in spanish , just because the word includes " matri " that means mother , and they ca n't be mothers , so why do n't they just call it civil unions ?
they say that that involves an implicit discrimination , but i do n't think so , is just calling things by its own name .
aurelio de la puerta , seville , spain my partner , who 's british , and i are one of the 5,000 couples queuing up to marry in spain .
pm zapatero should be applauded for his progressive stance while other leaders in so-called more liberal northern europe shy away from allowing full equality .

personally i think the " live and let live " motto works for me and i would remind the religious right that the same charter protects their rights to practise whatever religion they want .
they are a lot bigger issues facing canadian society that deserve our attention .
mack , ottawa , canada congratulations canada .
spain is next and hopefully many countries will follow .
about time gay people were treated equal .
ricardo yerro , pamplona , spain equality at last ! ! !
this was never a simple debate about a word .
this was : for all of those people who have been beaten to death simply for being who they are ; for all of those people who have taken their own lives , either as young people afraid of what they were feeling , or others in heterosexual marriages and not knowing what to do with their truth -lrb- and there are far , far too many of these people -rrb- ; for all of those people who marched " before it was popular " and were greeted by rocks and sticks instead of cheers .
for anyone , anywhere who faces inequality , bigotry and prejudice , this is a victory for all of us who would fight against those trying to deny us what they have so comfortably enjoyed for years .
i am personally overwhelmed , and fiercely proud to be a canadian this morning !
len t milley , toronto , canada i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed t. mooney , oakville , ontario the liberal minority government had no mandate from the canadian electorate to pass this bill .
i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed .
t. mooney , oakville , ontario at least in canada , all citizens are truly created equal .
i celebrate my 20th anniversary with my husband this coming week -lrb- yes , we 're gay -rrb- .
if finances and circumstances were different , a trip to canada would have been lovely !
at least our neighbours to the north have it right .
god bless them and god bless canada ! ! !
clay dove , dallas , tx , usa as much as i was against this bill and still am , please politicians can we just get on with running the country ?
i am sure that there are more important issues that deserve to take up just as much of your valuable time and need as much passion and debate .
susan chambers , oshawa , ontario , canada i 've no doubt that there will be howls of protest over this but in a truly fair and equal secular society it is perfectly right that gay men and women should have the right to an officially recognised life bond and the term marriage is as good as any who knows they might take it more seriously than a large number of heterosexuals do !
tim , plymouth , uk this is a proud moment for canada and the world .
it also offers another example of how to build an open and inclusive democratic society in contrast to the high state of fear and anxiety demonstrated by our neighbours to the south .
america needs us more than their leaders know .
tom , ottawa , canada this is dark day for canadian families .
polls indicate that a national referendum would show more than 70 % of canadians oppose the bill , and want to leave marriage as between a man and a woman .
james , freelton , on , canada fantastic !
hurrah !
canadians had it right when they said they were welcoming and inclusive .
perhaps the other north american country can learn to follow suit .
what a day for celebration that would be .

spain 's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages , making it the fourth country in the world to do so .
the spanish bill will become law in a month 's time , putting same-sex and heterosexual marriages on the same legal footing including the right to adopt children .
do you approve of same-sex marriage ?
would you consider travelling to either belgium , canada , the netherlands or spain to get married ?
should gay couples have the same rights as heterosexuals ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages balaji , chennai , india first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages .
let the world stop forcing its religious views upon the larger community .
balaji , chennai , india regardless of whether i am comfortable with homosexuality or not , i feel very strongly that it is none of my business how other people live their lives , especially their sex lives .
what really makes me cringe is when a group of people are denied their right to pursue happiness because they do not fit into the stereotypical mythical , white , christian 1950 's family unit complete with stay-at-home mom and all-knowing , strong , law-giving dad .
the constitution never specified freedom and equality only " within the boundaries of the christian conservative church " .
rhonda , houston , tx , usa to those who reject gay marriage on the basis of gay couples not being able to reproduce : what about heterosexual couples who can not or will not have children ?
should they be denied marriage also ?
mikko , finland the time appears to have come for gay marriages to be recognised more and more .
not only are nations increasingly recognising what 's natural and right but our church has decided at the atlanta convention to support gay marriage .
i 'm proud to be a part of my congregational church which is open and affirming in its views and i look forward to hearing from our minister when she returns .
dale lanan , longmont , colorado , usa i totally agree with civil marriage between homosexuals .
i know of a gay couple who were ' disowned ' by their parents when they decided to live together .
but when one of them fell ill and died , all of a sudden his family came to claim his possessions .
in a heterosexual marriage all that would belong to the spouse , but his partner was left with nothing and still is paying off debt from the medical costs from his partner 's illness .
i strongly believe in human rights and equality for all peoples and hope that very soon many more people will accept and embrace one another 's beliefs and rights .
fraiser , thailand as far as it is a civil marriage , there is no problem .
but it should not in anyway lead to child adoption .
it is a matter of human right and a child has the full right to have a mother and a father .
chadi , lebanon i love my country but it 's sad that the united states is so far behind when it comes to treating everyone as equal .
homosexuals , african americans , latinos , asians , jews , muslims , people with disabilities and anyone else considered ' different ' will know where i 'm coming from .
our country still holds the greatest influence in the world and i ask everyone to pray for our nation and our world in times of challenges between social and international issues that can impact our globe .
walter g , palm harbor , florida we are not against civil unions for homosexuals , i mean , they have to have exactly the same rights than heterosexuals in paying taxes -lrb- here in spain you can pay taxes on your own or with your couple -rrb- , widowed pension , and all civil rights you have just for marrying .
we are against the word " matrimonio " in spanish , just because the word includes " matri " that means mother , and they ca n't be mothers , so why do n't they just call it civil unions ?
they say that that involves an implicit discrimination , but i do n't think so , is just calling things by its own name .
aurelio de la puerta , seville , spain my partner , who 's british , and i are one of the 5,000 couples queuing up to marry in spain .
pm zapatero should be applauded for his progressive stance while other leaders in so-called more liberal northern europe shy away from allowing full equality .
i 'd add that it seems strange to take moral authority from the catholic church , an institution that has failed to address the issue of paedophile priests effectively , while its stand against the use of condoms has caused the deaths of millions of people from aids in africa .
aleksandar atanasov , malaga , spain in my opinion , the matter of same-sex marriages would not have been such a trouble if the religious right and similar people in europe had not made it a huge issue .
so members of non-heterosexual minorities want to marry each other ?
let them .
they regard it as a right , when their opponents would like to rid them of all rights -lrb- including health care -rrb- .
v lehtinen , tampere , finland gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide .
in the united states , the government champions equality , but does not follow through .
it is important that gays join african-americans and women in being liberated and being treated as equals .
gays are people too , and deserve to be treated as such .
becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states i understand both sides of this issue .
however , at the end of the day it is all about equality .
the religious right has to understand that stripping one group of their rights leads to a slippery slope that will one day have them stripped of theirs .
let 's be reasonable and fair to all .
i live as an equal .
i am a canadian !
michael talon , toronto , on , canada i believe couples with children carry the weight of a country by creating taxpayers etc .
homosexual couples can not give birth to children thus should not be allowed to have normal marriage rights .
this does not mean they are not human , it 's different .
john , melbourne we can not go on with such closed minds ! !
i know several gay couples and they all seem more committed to each other than most heterosexual couples .
they should have the same rights as anyone else .
they have the same emotions and the want for company that any human does .
gay people are not monsters , they are just like you and me and should not be persecuted like so many minorities are and have been throughout history .
zoe , hertfordshire , uk homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa < homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do , and there is no justification for opinions that state otherwise .
the purpose of marriage is to allow two people that love each other to be united in a beautiful bond , and this should not be denied to those whose sexual preferences are different from the majority .
cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa first they say that gays are too promiscuous .
then they get upset when we want to get married in a committed relationship .
religious fanatics seem so confused .
bernie , denver , co , usa we 're not talking about a church service but a civil marriage .
gays like any people have their civil rights like any other member of society .
roger pacheco , san francisco , usa it is to be expected that in an age of individualism coupled with rejection of universal morality that " gay marriage " should become increasingly acceptable .
in the long haul of history it is a sign of social and cultural decay .
william miller , kansas city , mo , usa why should any country hold a referendum on this issue ?
why should any majority have the right to decide on the human rights of any minority that is not breaking the law ?
there would still be segregation in the usa if the people there had had a referendum on racial equality in the 1960 's .
stephen , belfast ni the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed emily fogarty , smithfield , ri i can not believe this is happening .
it 's purely unnatural .
the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed .
emily fogarty , smithfield , ri to those who cry for national referendums and mandates from the electorate , i say this : basic human and civil rights are meant to protect minorities against majority oppression , not the other way around .
honestly , america 's brain drain will be canada 's gain .
if our country can not provide its citizens with the protections they need and deserve , expect nothing less than a mass exodus .
hopping the border is looking increasingly attractive ...
ellen , cincinnati , oh , usa reading many of the comments it seems that many parents are raising their children to believe that the love between gay couples is worth less than that between a man and a woman .
what nonsense .
also , gay people are n't trying to hijack a religious ceremony .
they are trying to enjoy the civil unions already afforded to straight couples .
why is there so much bitterness over the right for people in love to express themselves ?
david s , london , uk same sex marriage is about human rights .
arguments against this are simply prejudice and hatred disguised by religion and tradition .
christopher borycheski , toronto , canada whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant dean , boston , ma , usa whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant .
that should not preclude people around the world from enjoying equal rights and protections given to everybody else .
most opponents of gay marriage behave as if it would be mandatory and use the unbelievably selfish argument , " i do n't like this so you ca n't do it . "
these opponents of equality have no concept of what a free society is all about and will one day be ashamed of their backwards and bigoted views .
i 'm proud my state allows gay marriage , and big cheers for canada and spain !
dean , boston , ma , usa as a married woman with two children , i congratulate canada for allowing others - sisters and brothers - to share in the same depth of relationship which i fortunately enjoy .
shame to all those who prohibit others from love and life .
annette , philadelphia pa free will and equal rights .
if a gay couple wants to be married it is strictly their business .
no one tries to stop and no one argues the validity of a heterosexual couple 's marriage and as far as adoption goes , with so many children out there waiting to become part of a loving home , the more couples willing to adopt the better .
live and let live .
no one should take satisfaction in destroying another person 's chance at expressing their love in a permanent honourable fashion .
romee trofort , alexandria , va us equality and discrimination should be abolished wherever possible - if this includes giving full marriage rights to same sex partners then same sex marriage should be available and be open in as many places as possible .
thomas kubot , netherlands this is a slap in the face on my belief structure rodolfo , cincinnati , usa sad , very sad .
this is a slap in the face on my belief structure .
how can i teach my kids what is right if the world says what i believe is wrong ?
this is the impact of gay marriage .
rodolfo , cincinnati , usa congrats on passing your new law and showing the world that you stand for all human rights !
i wish our country would do the same .
i admire you all greatly !
congratulations !
gene , andover , minn . , usa it 's an important moment , knowing that when i finally fall in love , i 'll be able to solemnize our relationship like any other couple .
i 'm proud of our politicians for taking a step forward .
tim , toronto , canada i do n't see why any country recognizes marriage in the first place .
after all a separation of church and state should mean that the state would recognize only civil unions -lrb- which would be between all type hetero or homosexual couples -rrb- .
tristan benson , richmond , va .
deeply saddened by the politics and ethics that lead to this decision that hardly reflects the wishes or viewpoint of the majority of canadians .
it is not merely the conservative religious segment of canadian society , but also many ethnic cultural groups that are disapproving of this redefinition of the word " marriage " .
lisa , cambridge , canada last night was a great moment for canada and for the rest of the world .
thanks to all mps who voted in favour of the bill and to all other people who worked for this over the years !
spain will hopefully follow the lead later this week .
sami , helsinki , finland i 'm proud to be a canadian today !
s. terra , winnipeg manitoba canada congratulations canada !
it must be great living in a country where everyone is equal .
paul , bellingham , wa usa i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship patrick , madison , wisconsin , us canada has once again come to the forefront , while the united states , that bastion of " freedom " , is ready to do the opposite .
i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship .
if you disagree or disapprove , that is what your voice , your church , and your living room is for , but dissenters should not be allowed to take me away from my partner , bar me from his bedside , or prevent us from caring for each other , physically , spiritually , or financially .
patrick , madison , wisconsin , us i think this is an amazing day for us and the rest of the country , i can finally marry the one i love .
raymond parker , dieppe nb the orientation i was born with is heterosexual .
because this is " approved " i could be married anywhere .
but , if i marry again , i want to marry in canada where all persons have rights .
jim lawson , leonard ok , usa the passage of this bill does not reflect the values of the typical canadian .
if parliament had had the courage to submit this to a national referendum there is no doubt that it would have gone down to a resounding defeat .
pete , vancouver , canada i see nothing but positive coming from this .
gays and lesbians no longer have to suffer the heartbreaking issues that they had to endure by not having equal standing .
i am sure that the straight population will see that we have not lost anything and we have allowed people dignity .
i am overjoyed !
greg pressey , tillsonburg , canada this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities thom , montreal , canada this is a logical next step in the evolution of modern society .
homosexuals in canada have been waiting since 1967 -lrb- when homosexuality was decriminalized -rrb- for this day .
this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities .
i am from quebec and advocate the separation of this province from the rest of the country , but on a day like today i ca n't help but feel proud to live in canada .
thom seivewright , montreal , canada i think this is excellent !
honestly , what 's so wrong about gay people getting married ?
they 're not hurting anyone .
as for the ' true definition of marriage ' i think that 's a joke , what with shows like ' marry my dad ' how can they say that with a straight face ?
theresa , ontario , canada i have to say this is news that makes my heart happy .
people need to realize that true equality goes across the board - marriage should be for all , not just heterosexuals .
this is a step in the right direction !
usa , are you paying attention ?
peter , east greenwich , rhode island , usa being canadian , i am proud of the politicians who sided with freedom of choice and the people 's wish .
intolerance and despotism have no place in politic in a civilized world .
michel tremblay , canada it 's a matter of equal rights and balancing minority rights against the greater population .
it does n't affect my wife 's and my marriage in any way at all .
perhaps those who are so offended by it can now put their attention to canada 's high divorce rate -lrb- among heterosexual couples of course -rrb- .
gary , nelson , canada as a canadian living in england with my english partner of 5 years , we 're both proud to wave the canadian flag today !
canada is now a shining example to america and the rest of the world of the true and proper way to recognise the rights of all people , and not just those who follow an established religious code of ethics .
as prime minister paul martin has said , equal rights for minority groups is not something you can simply pick and choose .
r. fraser , london , uk we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage edward , london i 've been living with my canadian partner for over 10 years now and i welcome this legislation .
it means we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage , rather than put up with the second class " civil partnership " which the government is introducing here .
edward , london ca n't believe our politicians spent so much time on this issue !
i 'm definitely not against equal rights for gay couples but no matter what the politicians say , to me marriage will always be a union between a man and a woman .
mark , ottawa , canada as much as the religious right complain , i do n't see this having any impact on heterosexual couples , married or otherwise .

stephen , belfast ni the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed emily fogarty , smithfield , ri i can not believe this is happening .
it 's purely unnatural .
the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed .
emily fogarty , smithfield , ri to those who cry for national referendums and mandates from the electorate , i say this : basic human and civil rights are meant to protect minorities against majority oppression , not the other way around .
honestly , america 's brain drain will be canada 's gain .
if our country can not provide its citizens with the protections they need and deserve , expect nothing less than a mass exodus .
hopping the border is looking increasingly attractive ...
ellen , cincinnati , oh , usa reading many of the comments it seems that many parents are raising their children to believe that the love between gay couples is worth less than that between a man and a woman .
what nonsense .
also , gay people are n't trying to hijack a religious ceremony .
they are trying to enjoy the civil unions already afforded to straight couples .
why is there so much bitterness over the right for people in love to express themselves ?
david s , london , uk same sex marriage is about human rights .
arguments against this are simply prejudice and hatred disguised by religion and tradition .
christopher borycheski , toronto , canada whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant dean , boston , ma , usa whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant .
that should not preclude people around the world from enjoying equal rights and protections given to everybody else .
most opponents of gay marriage behave as if it would be mandatory and use the unbelievably selfish argument , " i do n't like this so you ca n't do it . "
these opponents of equality have no concept of what a free society is all about and will one day be ashamed of their backwards and bigoted views .
i 'm proud my state allows gay marriage , and big cheers for canada and spain !
dean , boston , ma , usa as a married woman with two children , i congratulate canada for allowing others - sisters and brothers - to share in the same depth of relationship which i fortunately enjoy .
shame to all those who prohibit others from love and life .
annette , philadelphia pa free will and equal rights .
if a gay couple wants to be married it is strictly their business .
no one tries to stop and no one argues the validity of a heterosexual couple 's marriage and as far as adoption goes , with so many children out there waiting to become part of a loving home , the more couples willing to adopt the better .
live and let live .
no one should take satisfaction in destroying another person 's chance at expressing their love in a permanent honourable fashion .
romee trofort , alexandria , va us equality and discrimination should be abolished wherever possible - if this includes giving full marriage rights to same sex partners then same sex marriage should be available and be open in as many places as possible .
thomas kubot , netherlands this is a slap in the face on my belief structure rodolfo , cincinnati , usa sad , very sad .
this is a slap in the face on my belief structure .
how can i teach my kids what is right if the world says what i believe is wrong ?
this is the impact of gay marriage .
rodolfo , cincinnati , usa congrats on passing your new law and showing the world that you stand for all human rights !
i wish our country would do the same .
i admire you all greatly !
congratulations !
gene , andover , minn . , usa it 's an important moment , knowing that when i finally fall in love , i 'll be able to solemnize our relationship like any other couple .
i 'm proud of our politicians for taking a step forward .
tim , toronto , canada i do n't see why any country recognizes marriage in the first place .
after all a separation of church and state should mean that the state would recognize only civil unions -lrb- which would be between all type hetero or homosexual couples -rrb- .
tristan benson , richmond , va .
deeply saddened by the politics and ethics that lead to this decision that hardly reflects the wishes or viewpoint of the majority of canadians .
it is not merely the conservative religious segment of canadian society , but also many ethnic cultural groups that are disapproving of this redefinition of the word " marriage " .
lisa , cambridge , canada last night was a great moment for canada and for the rest of the world .
thanks to all mps who voted in favour of the bill and to all other people who worked for this over the years !
spain will hopefully follow the lead later this week .
sami , helsinki , finland i 'm proud to be a canadian today !
s. terra , winnipeg manitoba canada congratulations canada !
it must be great living in a country where everyone is equal .
paul , bellingham , wa usa i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship patrick , madison , wisconsin , us canada has once again come to the forefront , while the united states , that bastion of " freedom " , is ready to do the opposite .
i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship .
if you disagree or disapprove , that is what your voice , your church , and your living room is for , but dissenters should not be allowed to take me away from my partner , bar me from his bedside , or prevent us from caring for each other , physically , spiritually , or financially .
patrick , madison , wisconsin , us i think this is an amazing day for us and the rest of the country , i can finally marry the one i love .
raymond parker , dieppe nb the orientation i was born with is heterosexual .
because this is " approved " i could be married anywhere .
but , if i marry again , i want to marry in canada where all persons have rights .
jim lawson , leonard ok , usa the passage of this bill does not reflect the values of the typical canadian .
if parliament had had the courage to submit this to a national referendum there is no doubt that it would have gone down to a resounding defeat .
pete , vancouver , canada i see nothing but positive coming from this .
gays and lesbians no longer have to suffer the heartbreaking issues that they had to endure by not having equal standing .
i am sure that the straight population will see that we have not lost anything and we have allowed people dignity .
i am overjoyed !
greg pressey , tillsonburg , canada this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities thom , montreal , canada this is a logical next step in the evolution of modern society .
homosexuals in canada have been waiting since 1967 -lrb- when homosexuality was decriminalized -rrb- for this day .
this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities .
i am from quebec and advocate the separation of this province from the rest of the country , but on a day like today i ca n't help but feel proud to live in canada .
thom seivewright , montreal , canada i think this is excellent !
honestly , what 's so wrong about gay people getting married ?
they 're not hurting anyone .
as for the ' true definition of marriage ' i think that 's a joke , what with shows like ' marry my dad ' how can they say that with a straight face ?
theresa , ontario , canada i have to say this is news that makes my heart happy .
people need to realize that true equality goes across the board - marriage should be for all , not just heterosexuals .
this is a step in the right direction !
usa , are you paying attention ?
peter , east greenwich , rhode island , usa being canadian , i am proud of the politicians who sided with freedom of choice and the people 's wish .
intolerance and despotism have no place in politic in a civilized world .
michel tremblay , canada it 's a matter of equal rights and balancing minority rights against the greater population .
it does n't affect my wife 's and my marriage in any way at all .
perhaps those who are so offended by it can now put their attention to canada 's high divorce rate -lrb- among heterosexual couples of course -rrb- .
gary , nelson , canada as a canadian living in england with my english partner of 5 years , we 're both proud to wave the canadian flag today !
canada is now a shining example to america and the rest of the world of the true and proper way to recognise the rights of all people , and not just those who follow an established religious code of ethics .
as prime minister paul martin has said , equal rights for minority groups is not something you can simply pick and choose .
r. fraser , london , uk we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage edward , london i 've been living with my canadian partner for over 10 years now and i welcome this legislation .
it means we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage , rather than put up with the second class " civil partnership " which the government is introducing here .
edward , london ca n't believe our politicians spent so much time on this issue !
i 'm definitely not against equal rights for gay couples but no matter what the politicians say , to me marriage will always be a union between a man and a woman .
mark , ottawa , canada as much as the religious right complain , i do n't see this having any impact on heterosexual couples , married or otherwise .
the facts are that parliament would have had to invoke the not withstanding clause to take a different course and what would that mean for gay couples that have already married after the high courts found that this was a charter of rights issue ?
personally i think the " live and let live " motto works for me and i would remind the religious right that the same charter protects their rights to practise whatever religion they want .
they are a lot bigger issues facing canadian society that deserve our attention .
mack , ottawa , canada congratulations canada .
spain is next and hopefully many countries will follow .
about time gay people were treated equal .
ricardo yerro , pamplona , spain equality at last ! ! !
this was never a simple debate about a word .
this was : for all of those people who have been beaten to death simply for being who they are ; for all of those people who have taken their own lives , either as young people afraid of what they were feeling , or others in heterosexual marriages and not knowing what to do with their truth -lrb- and there are far , far too many of these people -rrb- ; for all of those people who marched " before it was popular " and were greeted by rocks and sticks instead of cheers .
for anyone , anywhere who faces inequality , bigotry and prejudice , this is a victory for all of us who would fight against those trying to deny us what they have so comfortably enjoyed for years .
i am personally overwhelmed , and fiercely proud to be a canadian this morning !
len t milley , toronto , canada i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed t. mooney , oakville , ontario the liberal minority government had no mandate from the canadian electorate to pass this bill .
i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed .
t. mooney , oakville , ontario at least in canada , all citizens are truly created equal .
i celebrate my 20th anniversary with my husband this coming week -lrb- yes , we 're gay -rrb- .
if finances and circumstances were different , a trip to canada would have been lovely !
at least our neighbours to the north have it right .
god bless them and god bless canada ! ! !
clay dove , dallas , tx , usa as much as i was against this bill and still am , please politicians can we just get on with running the country ?
i am sure that there are more important issues that deserve to take up just as much of your valuable time and need as much passion and debate .
susan chambers , oshawa , ontario , canada i 've no doubt that there will be howls of protest over this but in a truly fair and equal secular society it is perfectly right that gay men and women should have the right to an officially recognised life bond and the term marriage is as good as any who knows they might take it more seriously than a large number of heterosexuals do !
tim , plymouth , uk this is a proud moment for canada and the world .
it also offers another example of how to build an open and inclusive democratic society in contrast to the high state of fear and anxiety demonstrated by our neighbours to the south .
america needs us more than their leaders know .
tom , ottawa , canada this is dark day for canadian families .
polls indicate that a national referendum would show more than 70 % of canadians oppose the bill , and want to leave marriage as between a man and a woman .
james , freelton , on , canada fantastic !
hurrah !
canadians had it right when they said they were welcoming and inclusive .
perhaps the other north american country can learn to follow suit .
what a day for celebration that would be .

spain 's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages , making it the fourth country in the world to do so .
the spanish bill will become law in a month 's time , putting same-sex and heterosexual marriages on the same legal footing including the right to adopt children .
do you approve of same-sex marriage ?
would you consider travelling to either belgium , canada , the netherlands or spain to get married ?
should gay couples have the same rights as heterosexuals ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages balaji , chennai , india first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages .
let the world stop forcing its religious views upon the larger community .
balaji , chennai , india regardless of whether i am comfortable with homosexuality or not , i feel very strongly that it is none of my business how other people live their lives , especially their sex lives .
what really makes me cringe is when a group of people are denied their right to pursue happiness because they do not fit into the stereotypical mythical , white , christian 1950 's family unit complete with stay-at-home mom and all-knowing , strong , law-giving dad .
the constitution never specified freedom and equality only " within the boundaries of the christian conservative church " .
rhonda , houston , tx , usa to those who reject gay marriage on the basis of gay couples not being able to reproduce : what about heterosexual couples who can not or will not have children ?
should they be denied marriage also ?
mikko , finland the time appears to have come for gay marriages to be recognised more and more .
not only are nations increasingly recognising what 's natural and right but our church has decided at the atlanta convention to support gay marriage .
i 'm proud to be a part of my congregational church which is open and affirming in its views and i look forward to hearing from our minister when she returns .
dale lanan , longmont , colorado , usa i totally agree with civil marriage between homosexuals .
i know of a gay couple who were ' disowned ' by their parents when they decided to live together .
but when one of them fell ill and died , all of a sudden his family came to claim his possessions .
in a heterosexual marriage all that would belong to the spouse , but his partner was left with nothing and still is paying off debt from the medical costs from his partner 's illness .
i strongly believe in human rights and equality for all peoples and hope that very soon many more people will accept and embrace one another 's beliefs and rights .
fraiser , thailand as far as it is a civil marriage , there is no problem .
but it should not in anyway lead to child adoption .
it is a matter of human right and a child has the full right to have a mother and a father .
chadi , lebanon i love my country but it 's sad that the united states is so far behind when it comes to treating everyone as equal .
homosexuals , african americans , latinos , asians , jews , muslims , people with disabilities and anyone else considered ' different ' will know where i 'm coming from .
our country still holds the greatest influence in the world and i ask everyone to pray for our nation and our world in times of challenges between social and international issues that can impact our globe .
walter g , palm harbor , florida we are not against civil unions for homosexuals , i mean , they have to have exactly the same rights than heterosexuals in paying taxes -lrb- here in spain you can pay taxes on your own or with your couple -rrb- , widowed pension , and all civil rights you have just for marrying .
we are against the word " matrimonio " in spanish , just because the word includes " matri " that means mother , and they ca n't be mothers , so why do n't they just call it civil unions ?
they say that that involves an implicit discrimination , but i do n't think so , is just calling things by its own name .
aurelio de la puerta , seville , spain my partner , who 's british , and i are one of the 5,000 couples queuing up to marry in spain .
pm zapatero should be applauded for his progressive stance while other leaders in so-called more liberal northern europe shy away from allowing full equality .
i 'd add that it seems strange to take moral authority from the catholic church , an institution that has failed to address the issue of paedophile priests effectively , while its stand against the use of condoms has caused the deaths of millions of people from aids in africa .
aleksandar atanasov , malaga , spain in my opinion , the matter of same-sex marriages would not have been such a trouble if the religious right and similar people in europe had not made it a huge issue .
so members of non-heterosexual minorities want to marry each other ?
let them .
they regard it as a right , when their opponents would like to rid them of all rights -lrb- including health care -rrb- .
v lehtinen , tampere , finland gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide .
in the united states , the government champions equality , but does not follow through .
it is important that gays join african-americans and women in being liberated and being treated as equals .
gays are people too , and deserve to be treated as such .
becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states i understand both sides of this issue .
however , at the end of the day it is all about equality .
the religious right has to understand that stripping one group of their rights leads to a slippery slope that will one day have them stripped of theirs .
let 's be reasonable and fair to all .
i live as an equal .
i am a canadian !
michael talon , toronto , on , canada i believe couples with children carry the weight of a country by creating taxpayers etc .
homosexual couples can not give birth to children thus should not be allowed to have normal marriage rights .
this does not mean they are not human , it 's different .
john , melbourne we can not go on with such closed minds ! !
i know several gay couples and they all seem more committed to each other than most heterosexual couples .
they should have the same rights as anyone else .
they have the same emotions and the want for company that any human does .
gay people are not monsters , they are just like you and me and should not be persecuted like so many minorities are and have been throughout history .
zoe , hertfordshire , uk homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa < homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do , and there is no justification for opinions that state otherwise .
the purpose of marriage is to allow two people that love each other to be united in a beautiful bond , and this should not be denied to those whose sexual preferences are different from the majority .
cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa first they say that gays are too promiscuous .
then they get upset when we want to get married in a committed relationship .
religious fanatics seem so confused .
bernie , denver , co , usa we 're not talking about a church service but a civil marriage .
gays like any people have their civil rights like any other member of society .
roger pacheco , san francisco , usa it is to be expected that in an age of individualism coupled with rejection of universal morality that " gay marriage " should become increasingly acceptable .
in the long haul of history it is a sign of social and cultural decay .
william miller , kansas city , mo , usa why should any country hold a referendum on this issue ?
why should any majority have the right to decide on the human rights of any minority that is not breaking the law ?
there would still be segregation in the usa if the people there had had a referendum on racial equality in the 1960 's .

spain 's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages , making it the fourth country in the world to do so .
the spanish bill will become law in a month 's time , putting same-sex and heterosexual marriages on the same legal footing including the right to adopt children .
do you approve of same-sex marriage ?
would you consider travelling to either belgium , canada , the netherlands or spain to get married ?
should gay couples have the same rights as heterosexuals ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages balaji , chennai , india first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages .
let the world stop forcing its religious views upon the larger community .
balaji , chennai , india regardless of whether i am comfortable with homosexuality or not , i feel very strongly that it is none of my business how other people live their lives , especially their sex lives .
what really makes me cringe is when a group of people are denied their right to pursue happiness because they do not fit into the stereotypical mythical , white , christian 1950 's family unit complete with stay-at-home mom and all-knowing , strong , law-giving dad .
the constitution never specified freedom and equality only " within the boundaries of the christian conservative church " .
rhonda , houston , tx , usa to those who reject gay marriage on the basis of gay couples not being able to reproduce : what about heterosexual couples who can not or will not have children ?
should they be denied marriage also ?
mikko , finland the time appears to have come for gay marriages to be recognised more and more .
not only are nations increasingly recognising what 's natural and right but our church has decided at the atlanta convention to support gay marriage .
i 'm proud to be a part of my congregational church which is open and affirming in its views and i look forward to hearing from our minister when she returns .
dale lanan , longmont , colorado , usa i totally agree with civil marriage between homosexuals .
i know of a gay couple who were ' disowned ' by their parents when they decided to live together .
but when one of them fell ill and died , all of a sudden his family came to claim his possessions .
in a heterosexual marriage all that would belong to the spouse , but his partner was left with nothing and still is paying off debt from the medical costs from his partner 's illness .
i strongly believe in human rights and equality for all peoples and hope that very soon many more people will accept and embrace one another 's beliefs and rights .
fraiser , thailand as far as it is a civil marriage , there is no problem .
but it should not in anyway lead to child adoption .
it is a matter of human right and a child has the full right to have a mother and a father .
chadi , lebanon i love my country but it 's sad that the united states is so far behind when it comes to treating everyone as equal .
homosexuals , african americans , latinos , asians , jews , muslims , people with disabilities and anyone else considered ' different ' will know where i 'm coming from .
our country still holds the greatest influence in the world and i ask everyone to pray for our nation and our world in times of challenges between social and international issues that can impact our globe .
walter g , palm harbor , florida we are not against civil unions for homosexuals , i mean , they have to have exactly the same rights than heterosexuals in paying taxes -lrb- here in spain you can pay taxes on your own or with your couple -rrb- , widowed pension , and all civil rights you have just for marrying .
we are against the word " matrimonio " in spanish , just because the word includes " matri " that means mother , and they ca n't be mothers , so why do n't they just call it civil unions ?
they say that that involves an implicit discrimination , but i do n't think so , is just calling things by its own name .
aurelio de la puerta , seville , spain my partner , who 's british , and i are one of the 5,000 couples queuing up to marry in spain .
pm zapatero should be applauded for his progressive stance while other leaders in so-called more liberal northern europe shy away from allowing full equality .
i 'd add that it seems strange to take moral authority from the catholic church , an institution that has failed to address the issue of paedophile priests effectively , while its stand against the use of condoms has caused the deaths of millions of people from aids in africa .
aleksandar atanasov , malaga , spain in my opinion , the matter of same-sex marriages would not have been such a trouble if the religious right and similar people in europe had not made it a huge issue .
so members of non-heterosexual minorities want to marry each other ?
let them .
they regard it as a right , when their opponents would like to rid them of all rights -lrb- including health care -rrb- .
v lehtinen , tampere , finland gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide .
in the united states , the government champions equality , but does not follow through .
it is important that gays join african-americans and women in being liberated and being treated as equals .
gays are people too , and deserve to be treated as such .
becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states i understand both sides of this issue .
however , at the end of the day it is all about equality .
the religious right has to understand that stripping one group of their rights leads to a slippery slope that will one day have them stripped of theirs .
let 's be reasonable and fair to all .
i live as an equal .
i am a canadian !
michael talon , toronto , on , canada i believe couples with children carry the weight of a country by creating taxpayers etc .
homosexual couples can not give birth to children thus should not be allowed to have normal marriage rights .
this does not mean they are not human , it 's different .
john , melbourne we can not go on with such closed minds ! !
i know several gay couples and they all seem more committed to each other than most heterosexual couples .
they should have the same rights as anyone else .
they have the same emotions and the want for company that any human does .
gay people are not monsters , they are just like you and me and should not be persecuted like so many minorities are and have been throughout history .
zoe , hertfordshire , uk homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa < homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do , and there is no justification for opinions that state otherwise .
the purpose of marriage is to allow two people that love each other to be united in a beautiful bond , and this should not be denied to those whose sexual preferences are different from the majority .
cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa first they say that gays are too promiscuous .
then they get upset when we want to get married in a committed relationship .
religious fanatics seem so confused .
bernie , denver , co , usa we 're not talking about a church service but a civil marriage .
gays like any people have their civil rights like any other member of society .
roger pacheco , san francisco , usa it is to be expected that in an age of individualism coupled with rejection of universal morality that " gay marriage " should become increasingly acceptable .
in the long haul of history it is a sign of social and cultural decay .
william miller , kansas city , mo , usa why should any country hold a referendum on this issue ?
why should any majority have the right to decide on the human rights of any minority that is not breaking the law ?
there would still be segregation in the usa if the people there had had a referendum on racial equality in the 1960 's .
stephen , belfast ni the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed emily fogarty , smithfield , ri i can not believe this is happening .
it 's purely unnatural .
the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed .
emily fogarty , smithfield , ri to those who cry for national referendums and mandates from the electorate , i say this : basic human and civil rights are meant to protect minorities against majority oppression , not the other way around .
honestly , america 's brain drain will be canada 's gain .
if our country can not provide its citizens with the protections they need and deserve , expect nothing less than a mass exodus .
hopping the border is looking increasingly attractive ...
ellen , cincinnati , oh , usa reading many of the comments it seems that many parents are raising their children to believe that the love between gay couples is worth less than that between a man and a woman .
what nonsense .
also , gay people are n't trying to hijack a religious ceremony .
they are trying to enjoy the civil unions already afforded to straight couples .
why is there so much bitterness over the right for people in love to express themselves ?
david s , london , uk same sex marriage is about human rights .
arguments against this are simply prejudice and hatred disguised by religion and tradition .
christopher borycheski , toronto , canada whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant dean , boston , ma , usa whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant .
that should not preclude people around the world from enjoying equal rights and protections given to everybody else .
most opponents of gay marriage behave as if it would be mandatory and use the unbelievably selfish argument , " i do n't like this so you ca n't do it . "
these opponents of equality have no concept of what a free society is all about and will one day be ashamed of their backwards and bigoted views .
i 'm proud my state allows gay marriage , and big cheers for canada and spain !
dean , boston , ma , usa as a married woman with two children , i congratulate canada for allowing others - sisters and brothers - to share in the same depth of relationship which i fortunately enjoy .
shame to all those who prohibit others from love and life .
annette , philadelphia pa free will and equal rights .
if a gay couple wants to be married it is strictly their business .
no one tries to stop and no one argues the validity of a heterosexual couple 's marriage and as far as adoption goes , with so many children out there waiting to become part of a loving home , the more couples willing to adopt the better .
live and let live .
no one should take satisfaction in destroying another person 's chance at expressing their love in a permanent honourable fashion .
romee trofort , alexandria , va us equality and discrimination should be abolished wherever possible - if this includes giving full marriage rights to same sex partners then same sex marriage should be available and be open in as many places as possible .
thomas kubot , netherlands this is a slap in the face on my belief structure rodolfo , cincinnati , usa sad , very sad .
this is a slap in the face on my belief structure .
how can i teach my kids what is right if the world says what i believe is wrong ?
this is the impact of gay marriage .
rodolfo , cincinnati , usa congrats on passing your new law and showing the world that you stand for all human rights !
i wish our country would do the same .
i admire you all greatly !
congratulations !
gene , andover , minn . , usa it 's an important moment , knowing that when i finally fall in love , i 'll be able to solemnize our relationship like any other couple .
i 'm proud of our politicians for taking a step forward .
tim , toronto , canada i do n't see why any country recognizes marriage in the first place .
after all a separation of church and state should mean that the state would recognize only civil unions -lrb- which would be between all type hetero or homosexual couples -rrb- .
tristan benson , richmond , va .
deeply saddened by the politics and ethics that lead to this decision that hardly reflects the wishes or viewpoint of the majority of canadians .
it is not merely the conservative religious segment of canadian society , but also many ethnic cultural groups that are disapproving of this redefinition of the word " marriage " .
lisa , cambridge , canada last night was a great moment for canada and for the rest of the world .
thanks to all mps who voted in favour of the bill and to all other people who worked for this over the years !
spain will hopefully follow the lead later this week .
sami , helsinki , finland i 'm proud to be a canadian today !
s. terra , winnipeg manitoba canada congratulations canada !
it must be great living in a country where everyone is equal .
paul , bellingham , wa usa i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship patrick , madison , wisconsin , us canada has once again come to the forefront , while the united states , that bastion of " freedom " , is ready to do the opposite .
i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship .
if you disagree or disapprove , that is what your voice , your church , and your living room is for , but dissenters should not be allowed to take me away from my partner , bar me from his bedside , or prevent us from caring for each other , physically , spiritually , or financially .
patrick , madison , wisconsin , us i think this is an amazing day for us and the rest of the country , i can finally marry the one i love .
raymond parker , dieppe nb the orientation i was born with is heterosexual .
because this is " approved " i could be married anywhere .
but , if i marry again , i want to marry in canada where all persons have rights .
jim lawson , leonard ok , usa the passage of this bill does not reflect the values of the typical canadian .
if parliament had had the courage to submit this to a national referendum there is no doubt that it would have gone down to a resounding defeat .
pete , vancouver , canada i see nothing but positive coming from this .
gays and lesbians no longer have to suffer the heartbreaking issues that they had to endure by not having equal standing .
i am sure that the straight population will see that we have not lost anything and we have allowed people dignity .
i am overjoyed !
greg pressey , tillsonburg , canada this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities thom , montreal , canada this is a logical next step in the evolution of modern society .
homosexuals in canada have been waiting since 1967 -lrb- when homosexuality was decriminalized -rrb- for this day .
this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities .
i am from quebec and advocate the separation of this province from the rest of the country , but on a day like today i ca n't help but feel proud to live in canada .
thom seivewright , montreal , canada i think this is excellent !
honestly , what 's so wrong about gay people getting married ?
they 're not hurting anyone .
as for the ' true definition of marriage ' i think that 's a joke , what with shows like ' marry my dad ' how can they say that with a straight face ?
theresa , ontario , canada i have to say this is news that makes my heart happy .
people need to realize that true equality goes across the board - marriage should be for all , not just heterosexuals .
this is a step in the right direction !
usa , are you paying attention ?
peter , east greenwich , rhode island , usa being canadian , i am proud of the politicians who sided with freedom of choice and the people 's wish .
intolerance and despotism have no place in politic in a civilized world .
michel tremblay , canada it 's a matter of equal rights and balancing minority rights against the greater population .
it does n't affect my wife 's and my marriage in any way at all .
perhaps those who are so offended by it can now put their attention to canada 's high divorce rate -lrb- among heterosexual couples of course -rrb- .
gary , nelson , canada as a canadian living in england with my english partner of 5 years , we 're both proud to wave the canadian flag today !
canada is now a shining example to america and the rest of the world of the true and proper way to recognise the rights of all people , and not just those who follow an established religious code of ethics .
as prime minister paul martin has said , equal rights for minority groups is not something you can simply pick and choose .
r. fraser , london , uk we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage edward , london i 've been living with my canadian partner for over 10 years now and i welcome this legislation .
it means we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage , rather than put up with the second class " civil partnership " which the government is introducing here .
edward , london ca n't believe our politicians spent so much time on this issue !
i 'm definitely not against equal rights for gay couples but no matter what the politicians say , to me marriage will always be a union between a man and a woman .
mark , ottawa , canada as much as the religious right complain , i do n't see this having any impact on heterosexual couples , married or otherwise .
the facts are that parliament would have had to invoke the not withstanding clause to take a different course and what would that mean for gay couples that have already married after the high courts found that this was a charter of rights issue ?
personally i think the " live and let live " motto works for me and i would remind the religious right that the same charter protects their rights to practise whatever religion they want .
they are a lot bigger issues facing canadian society that deserve our attention .
mack , ottawa , canada congratulations canada .
spain is next and hopefully many countries will follow .
about time gay people were treated equal .
ricardo yerro , pamplona , spain equality at last ! ! !
this was never a simple debate about a word .
this was : for all of those people who have been beaten to death simply for being who they are ; for all of those people who have taken their own lives , either as young people afraid of what they were feeling , or others in heterosexual marriages and not knowing what to do with their truth -lrb- and there are far , far too many of these people -rrb- ; for all of those people who marched " before it was popular " and were greeted by rocks and sticks instead of cheers .
for anyone , anywhere who faces inequality , bigotry and prejudice , this is a victory for all of us who would fight against those trying to deny us what they have so comfortably enjoyed for years .
i am personally overwhelmed , and fiercely proud to be a canadian this morning !
len t milley , toronto , canada i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed t. mooney , oakville , ontario the liberal minority government had no mandate from the canadian electorate to pass this bill .
i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed .
t. mooney , oakville , ontario at least in canada , all citizens are truly created equal .
i celebrate my 20th anniversary with my husband this coming week -lrb- yes , we 're gay -rrb- .
if finances and circumstances were different , a trip to canada would have been lovely !
at least our neighbours to the north have it right .
god bless them and god bless canada ! ! !
clay dove , dallas , tx , usa as much as i was against this bill and still am , please politicians can we just get on with running the country ?
i am sure that there are more important issues that deserve to take up just as much of your valuable time and need as much passion and debate .
susan chambers , oshawa , ontario , canada i 've no doubt that there will be howls of protest over this but in a truly fair and equal secular society it is perfectly right that gay men and women should have the right to an officially recognised life bond and the term marriage is as good as any who knows they might take it more seriously than a large number of heterosexuals do !
tim , plymouth , uk this is a proud moment for canada and the world .
it also offers another example of how to build an open and inclusive democratic society in contrast to the high state of fear and anxiety demonstrated by our neighbours to the south .
america needs us more than their leaders know .
tom , ottawa , canada this is dark day for canadian families .
polls indicate that a national referendum would show more than 70 % of canadians oppose the bill , and want to leave marriage as between a man and a woman .
james , freelton , on , canada fantastic !
hurrah !
canadians had it right when they said they were welcoming and inclusive .
perhaps the other north american country can learn to follow suit .
what a day for celebration that would be .

i 'm proud of our politicians for taking a step forward .
tim , toronto , canada i do n't see why any country recognizes marriage in the first place .
after all a separation of church and state should mean that the state would recognize only civil unions -lrb- which would be between all type hetero or homosexual couples -rrb- .
tristan benson , richmond , va .
deeply saddened by the politics and ethics that lead to this decision that hardly reflects the wishes or viewpoint of the majority of canadians .
it is not merely the conservative religious segment of canadian society , but also many ethnic cultural groups that are disapproving of this redefinition of the word " marriage " .
lisa , cambridge , canada last night was a great moment for canada and for the rest of the world .
thanks to all mps who voted in favour of the bill and to all other people who worked for this over the years !
spain will hopefully follow the lead later this week .
sami , helsinki , finland i 'm proud to be a canadian today !
s. terra , winnipeg manitoba canada congratulations canada !
it must be great living in a country where everyone is equal .
paul , bellingham , wa usa i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship patrick , madison , wisconsin , us canada has once again come to the forefront , while the united states , that bastion of " freedom " , is ready to do the opposite .
i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship .
if you disagree or disapprove , that is what your voice , your church , and your living room is for , but dissenters should not be allowed to take me away from my partner , bar me from his bedside , or prevent us from caring for each other , physically , spiritually , or financially .
patrick , madison , wisconsin , us i think this is an amazing day for us and the rest of the country , i can finally marry the one i love .
raymond parker , dieppe nb the orientation i was born with is heterosexual .
because this is " approved " i could be married anywhere .
but , if i marry again , i want to marry in canada where all persons have rights .
jim lawson , leonard ok , usa the passage of this bill does not reflect the values of the typical canadian .
if parliament had had the courage to submit this to a national referendum there is no doubt that it would have gone down to a resounding defeat .
pete , vancouver , canada i see nothing but positive coming from this .
gays and lesbians no longer have to suffer the heartbreaking issues that they had to endure by not having equal standing .
i am sure that the straight population will see that we have not lost anything and we have allowed people dignity .
i am overjoyed !
greg pressey , tillsonburg , canada this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities thom , montreal , canada this is a logical next step in the evolution of modern society .
homosexuals in canada have been waiting since 1967 -lrb- when homosexuality was decriminalized -rrb- for this day .
this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities .
i am from quebec and advocate the separation of this province from the rest of the country , but on a day like today i ca n't help but feel proud to live in canada .
thom seivewright , montreal , canada i think this is excellent !
honestly , what 's so wrong about gay people getting married ?
they 're not hurting anyone .
as for the ' true definition of marriage ' i think that 's a joke , what with shows like ' marry my dad ' how can they say that with a straight face ?
theresa , ontario , canada i have to say this is news that makes my heart happy .
people need to realize that true equality goes across the board - marriage should be for all , not just heterosexuals .
this is a step in the right direction !
usa , are you paying attention ?
peter , east greenwich , rhode island , usa being canadian , i am proud of the politicians who sided with freedom of choice and the people 's wish .
intolerance and despotism have no place in politic in a civilized world .
michel tremblay , canada it 's a matter of equal rights and balancing minority rights against the greater population .
it does n't affect my wife 's and my marriage in any way at all .
perhaps those who are so offended by it can now put their attention to canada 's high divorce rate -lrb- among heterosexual couples of course -rrb- .
gary , nelson , canada as a canadian living in england with my english partner of 5 years , we 're both proud to wave the canadian flag today !
canada is now a shining example to america and the rest of the world of the true and proper way to recognise the rights of all people , and not just those who follow an established religious code of ethics .
as prime minister paul martin has said , equal rights for minority groups is not something you can simply pick and choose .
r. fraser , london , uk we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage edward , london i 've been living with my canadian partner for over 10 years now and i welcome this legislation .
it means we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage , rather than put up with the second class " civil partnership " which the government is introducing here .
edward , london ca n't believe our politicians spent so much time on this issue !
i 'm definitely not against equal rights for gay couples but no matter what the politicians say , to me marriage will always be a union between a man and a woman .
mark , ottawa , canada as much as the religious right complain , i do n't see this having any impact on heterosexual couples , married or otherwise .
the facts are that parliament would have had to invoke the not withstanding clause to take a different course and what would that mean for gay couples that have already married after the high courts found that this was a charter of rights issue ?
personally i think the " live and let live " motto works for me and i would remind the religious right that the same charter protects their rights to practise whatever religion they want .
they are a lot bigger issues facing canadian society that deserve our attention .
mack , ottawa , canada congratulations canada .
spain is next and hopefully many countries will follow .
about time gay people were treated equal .
ricardo yerro , pamplona , spain equality at last ! ! !
this was never a simple debate about a word .
this was : for all of those people who have been beaten to death simply for being who they are ; for all of those people who have taken their own lives , either as young people afraid of what they were feeling , or others in heterosexual marriages and not knowing what to do with their truth -lrb- and there are far , far too many of these people -rrb- ; for all of those people who marched " before it was popular " and were greeted by rocks and sticks instead of cheers .
for anyone , anywhere who faces inequality , bigotry and prejudice , this is a victory for all of us who would fight against those trying to deny us what they have so comfortably enjoyed for years .
i am personally overwhelmed , and fiercely proud to be a canadian this morning !
len t milley , toronto , canada i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed t. mooney , oakville , ontario the liberal minority government had no mandate from the canadian electorate to pass this bill .
i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed .
t. mooney , oakville , ontario at least in canada , all citizens are truly created equal .
i celebrate my 20th anniversary with my husband this coming week -lrb- yes , we 're gay -rrb- .
if finances and circumstances were different , a trip to canada would have been lovely !
at least our neighbours to the north have it right .
god bless them and god bless canada ! ! !
clay dove , dallas , tx , usa as much as i was against this bill and still am , please politicians can we just get on with running the country ?
i am sure that there are more important issues that deserve to take up just as much of your valuable time and need as much passion and debate .
susan chambers , oshawa , ontario , canada i 've no doubt that there will be howls of protest over this but in a truly fair and equal secular society it is perfectly right that gay men and women should have the right to an officially recognised life bond and the term marriage is as good as any who knows they might take it more seriously than a large number of heterosexuals do !
tim , plymouth , uk this is a proud moment for canada and the world .
it also offers another example of how to build an open and inclusive democratic society in contrast to the high state of fear and anxiety demonstrated by our neighbours to the south .
america needs us more than their leaders know .
tom , ottawa , canada this is dark day for canadian families .
polls indicate that a national referendum would show more than 70 % of canadians oppose the bill , and want to leave marriage as between a man and a woman .
james , freelton , on , canada fantastic !
hurrah !
canadians had it right when they said they were welcoming and inclusive .
perhaps the other north american country can learn to follow suit .
what a day for celebration that would be .

spain 's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages , making it the fourth country in the world to do so .
the spanish bill will become law in a month 's time , putting same-sex and heterosexual marriages on the same legal footing including the right to adopt children .
do you approve of same-sex marriage ?
would you consider travelling to either belgium , canada , the netherlands or spain to get married ?
should gay couples have the same rights as heterosexuals ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages balaji , chennai , india first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages .
let the world stop forcing its religious views upon the larger community .
balaji , chennai , india regardless of whether i am comfortable with homosexuality or not , i feel very strongly that it is none of my business how other people live their lives , especially their sex lives .
what really makes me cringe is when a group of people are denied their right to pursue happiness because they do not fit into the stereotypical mythical , white , christian 1950 's family unit complete with stay-at-home mom and all-knowing , strong , law-giving dad .
the constitution never specified freedom and equality only " within the boundaries of the christian conservative church " .
rhonda , houston , tx , usa to those who reject gay marriage on the basis of gay couples not being able to reproduce : what about heterosexual couples who can not or will not have children ?
should they be denied marriage also ?
mikko , finland the time appears to have come for gay marriages to be recognised more and more .
not only are nations increasingly recognising what 's natural and right but our church has decided at the atlanta convention to support gay marriage .
i 'm proud to be a part of my congregational church which is open and affirming in its views and i look forward to hearing from our minister when she returns .
dale lanan , longmont , colorado , usa i totally agree with civil marriage between homosexuals .
i know of a gay couple who were ' disowned ' by their parents when they decided to live together .
but when one of them fell ill and died , all of a sudden his family came to claim his possessions .
in a heterosexual marriage all that would belong to the spouse , but his partner was left with nothing and still is paying off debt from the medical costs from his partner 's illness .
i strongly believe in human rights and equality for all peoples and hope that very soon many more people will accept and embrace one another 's beliefs and rights .
fraiser , thailand as far as it is a civil marriage , there is no problem .
but it should not in anyway lead to child adoption .
it is a matter of human right and a child has the full right to have a mother and a father .
chadi , lebanon i love my country but it 's sad that the united states is so far behind when it comes to treating everyone as equal .
homosexuals , african americans , latinos , asians , jews , muslims , people with disabilities and anyone else considered ' different ' will know where i 'm coming from .
our country still holds the greatest influence in the world and i ask everyone to pray for our nation and our world in times of challenges between social and international issues that can impact our globe .
walter g , palm harbor , florida we are not against civil unions for homosexuals , i mean , they have to have exactly the same rights than heterosexuals in paying taxes -lrb- here in spain you can pay taxes on your own or with your couple -rrb- , widowed pension , and all civil rights you have just for marrying .
we are against the word " matrimonio " in spanish , just because the word includes " matri " that means mother , and they ca n't be mothers , so why do n't they just call it civil unions ?
they say that that involves an implicit discrimination , but i do n't think so , is just calling things by its own name .
aurelio de la puerta , seville , spain my partner , who 's british , and i are one of the 5,000 couples queuing up to marry in spain .
pm zapatero should be applauded for his progressive stance while other leaders in so-called more liberal northern europe shy away from allowing full equality .
i 'd add that it seems strange to take moral authority from the catholic church , an institution that has failed to address the issue of paedophile priests effectively , while its stand against the use of condoms has caused the deaths of millions of people from aids in africa .
aleksandar atanasov , malaga , spain in my opinion , the matter of same-sex marriages would not have been such a trouble if the religious right and similar people in europe had not made it a huge issue .
so members of non-heterosexual minorities want to marry each other ?
let them .
they regard it as a right , when their opponents would like to rid them of all rights -lrb- including health care -rrb- .
v lehtinen , tampere , finland gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide .
in the united states , the government champions equality , but does not follow through .
it is important that gays join african-americans and women in being liberated and being treated as equals .
gays are people too , and deserve to be treated as such .
becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states i understand both sides of this issue .
however , at the end of the day it is all about equality .
the religious right has to understand that stripping one group of their rights leads to a slippery slope that will one day have them stripped of theirs .
let 's be reasonable and fair to all .
i live as an equal .
i am a canadian !
michael talon , toronto , on , canada i believe couples with children carry the weight of a country by creating taxpayers etc .
homosexual couples can not give birth to children thus should not be allowed to have normal marriage rights .
this does not mean they are not human , it 's different .
john , melbourne we can not go on with such closed minds ! !
i know several gay couples and they all seem more committed to each other than most heterosexual couples .
they should have the same rights as anyone else .
they have the same emotions and the want for company that any human does .
gay people are not monsters , they are just like you and me and should not be persecuted like so many minorities are and have been throughout history .
zoe , hertfordshire , uk homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa < homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do , and there is no justification for opinions that state otherwise .
the purpose of marriage is to allow two people that love each other to be united in a beautiful bond , and this should not be denied to those whose sexual preferences are different from the majority .
cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa first they say that gays are too promiscuous .
then they get upset when we want to get married in a committed relationship .
religious fanatics seem so confused .
bernie , denver , co , usa we 're not talking about a church service but a civil marriage .
gays like any people have their civil rights like any other member of society .
roger pacheco , san francisco , usa it is to be expected that in an age of individualism coupled with rejection of universal morality that " gay marriage " should become increasingly acceptable .
in the long haul of history it is a sign of social and cultural decay .
william miller , kansas city , mo , usa why should any country hold a referendum on this issue ?
why should any majority have the right to decide on the human rights of any minority that is not breaking the law ?
there would still be segregation in the usa if the people there had had a referendum on racial equality in the 1960 's .
stephen , belfast ni the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed emily fogarty , smithfield , ri i can not believe this is happening .
it 's purely unnatural .
the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed .
emily fogarty , smithfield , ri to those who cry for national referendums and mandates from the electorate , i say this : basic human and civil rights are meant to protect minorities against majority oppression , not the other way around .
honestly , america 's brain drain will be canada 's gain .
if our country can not provide its citizens with the protections they need and deserve , expect nothing less than a mass exodus .
hopping the border is looking increasingly attractive ...
ellen , cincinnati , oh , usa reading many of the comments it seems that many parents are raising their children to believe that the love between gay couples is worth less than that between a man and a woman .
what nonsense .
also , gay people are n't trying to hijack a religious ceremony .
they are trying to enjoy the civil unions already afforded to straight couples .
why is there so much bitterness over the right for people in love to express themselves ?
david s , london , uk same sex marriage is about human rights .
arguments against this are simply prejudice and hatred disguised by religion and tradition .
christopher borycheski , toronto , canada whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant dean , boston , ma , usa whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant .
that should not preclude people around the world from enjoying equal rights and protections given to everybody else .
most opponents of gay marriage behave as if it would be mandatory and use the unbelievably selfish argument , " i do n't like this so you ca n't do it . "
these opponents of equality have no concept of what a free society is all about and will one day be ashamed of their backwards and bigoted views .
i 'm proud my state allows gay marriage , and big cheers for canada and spain !
dean , boston , ma , usa as a married woman with two children , i congratulate canada for allowing others - sisters and brothers - to share in the same depth of relationship which i fortunately enjoy .
shame to all those who prohibit others from love and life .
annette , philadelphia pa free will and equal rights .
if a gay couple wants to be married it is strictly their business .
no one tries to stop and no one argues the validity of a heterosexual couple 's marriage and as far as adoption goes , with so many children out there waiting to become part of a loving home , the more couples willing to adopt the better .
live and let live .
no one should take satisfaction in destroying another person 's chance at expressing their love in a permanent honourable fashion .
romee trofort , alexandria , va us equality and discrimination should be abolished wherever possible - if this includes giving full marriage rights to same sex partners then same sex marriage should be available and be open in as many places as possible .
thomas kubot , netherlands this is a slap in the face on my belief structure rodolfo , cincinnati , usa sad , very sad .
this is a slap in the face on my belief structure .
how can i teach my kids what is right if the world says what i believe is wrong ?
this is the impact of gay marriage .
rodolfo , cincinnati , usa congrats on passing your new law and showing the world that you stand for all human rights !
i wish our country would do the same .
i admire you all greatly !
congratulations !
gene , andover , minn . , usa it 's an important moment , knowing that when i finally fall in love , i 'll be able to solemnize our relationship like any other couple .

but when one of them fell ill and died , all of a sudden his family came to claim his possessions .
in a heterosexual marriage all that would belong to the spouse , but his partner was left with nothing and still is paying off debt from the medical costs from his partner 's illness .
i strongly believe in human rights and equality for all peoples and hope that very soon many more people will accept and embrace one another 's beliefs and rights .
fraiser , thailand as far as it is a civil marriage , there is no problem .
but it should not in anyway lead to child adoption .
it is a matter of human right and a child has the full right to have a mother and a father .
chadi , lebanon i love my country but it 's sad that the united states is so far behind when it comes to treating everyone as equal .
homosexuals , african americans , latinos , asians , jews , muslims , people with disabilities and anyone else considered ' different ' will know where i 'm coming from .
our country still holds the greatest influence in the world and i ask everyone to pray for our nation and our world in times of challenges between social and international issues that can impact our globe .
walter g , palm harbor , florida we are not against civil unions for homosexuals , i mean , they have to have exactly the same rights than heterosexuals in paying taxes -lrb- here in spain you can pay taxes on your own or with your couple -rrb- , widowed pension , and all civil rights you have just for marrying .
we are against the word " matrimonio " in spanish , just because the word includes " matri " that means mother , and they ca n't be mothers , so why do n't they just call it civil unions ?
they say that that involves an implicit discrimination , but i do n't think so , is just calling things by its own name .
aurelio de la puerta , seville , spain my partner , who 's british , and i are one of the 5,000 couples queuing up to marry in spain .
pm zapatero should be applauded for his progressive stance while other leaders in so-called more liberal northern europe shy away from allowing full equality .
i 'd add that it seems strange to take moral authority from the catholic church , an institution that has failed to address the issue of paedophile priests effectively , while its stand against the use of condoms has caused the deaths of millions of people from aids in africa .
aleksandar atanasov , malaga , spain in my opinion , the matter of same-sex marriages would not have been such a trouble if the religious right and similar people in europe had not made it a huge issue .
so members of non-heterosexual minorities want to marry each other ?
let them .
they regard it as a right , when their opponents would like to rid them of all rights -lrb- including health care -rrb- .
v lehtinen , tampere , finland gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide .
in the united states , the government champions equality , but does not follow through .
it is important that gays join african-americans and women in being liberated and being treated as equals .
gays are people too , and deserve to be treated as such .
becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states i understand both sides of this issue .
however , at the end of the day it is all about equality .
the religious right has to understand that stripping one group of their rights leads to a slippery slope that will one day have them stripped of theirs .
let 's be reasonable and fair to all .
i live as an equal .
i am a canadian !
michael talon , toronto , on , canada i believe couples with children carry the weight of a country by creating taxpayers etc .
homosexual couples can not give birth to children thus should not be allowed to have normal marriage rights .
this does not mean they are not human , it 's different .
john , melbourne we can not go on with such closed minds ! !
i know several gay couples and they all seem more committed to each other than most heterosexual couples .
they should have the same rights as anyone else .
they have the same emotions and the want for company that any human does .
gay people are not monsters , they are just like you and me and should not be persecuted like so many minorities are and have been throughout history .
zoe , hertfordshire , uk homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa < homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do , and there is no justification for opinions that state otherwise .
the purpose of marriage is to allow two people that love each other to be united in a beautiful bond , and this should not be denied to those whose sexual preferences are different from the majority .
cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa first they say that gays are too promiscuous .
then they get upset when we want to get married in a committed relationship .
religious fanatics seem so confused .
bernie , denver , co , usa we 're not talking about a church service but a civil marriage .
gays like any people have their civil rights like any other member of society .
roger pacheco , san francisco , usa it is to be expected that in an age of individualism coupled with rejection of universal morality that " gay marriage " should become increasingly acceptable .
in the long haul of history it is a sign of social and cultural decay .
william miller , kansas city , mo , usa why should any country hold a referendum on this issue ?
why should any majority have the right to decide on the human rights of any minority that is not breaking the law ?
there would still be segregation in the usa if the people there had had a referendum on racial equality in the 1960 's .
stephen , belfast ni the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed emily fogarty , smithfield , ri i can not believe this is happening .
it 's purely unnatural .
the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed .
emily fogarty , smithfield , ri to those who cry for national referendums and mandates from the electorate , i say this : basic human and civil rights are meant to protect minorities against majority oppression , not the other way around .
honestly , america 's brain drain will be canada 's gain .
if our country can not provide its citizens with the protections they need and deserve , expect nothing less than a mass exodus .
hopping the border is looking increasingly attractive ...
ellen , cincinnati , oh , usa reading many of the comments it seems that many parents are raising their children to believe that the love between gay couples is worth less than that between a man and a woman .
what nonsense .
also , gay people are n't trying to hijack a religious ceremony .
they are trying to enjoy the civil unions already afforded to straight couples .
why is there so much bitterness over the right for people in love to express themselves ?
david s , london , uk same sex marriage is about human rights .
arguments against this are simply prejudice and hatred disguised by religion and tradition .
christopher borycheski , toronto , canada whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant dean , boston , ma , usa whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant .
that should not preclude people around the world from enjoying equal rights and protections given to everybody else .
most opponents of gay marriage behave as if it would be mandatory and use the unbelievably selfish argument , " i do n't like this so you ca n't do it . "
these opponents of equality have no concept of what a free society is all about and will one day be ashamed of their backwards and bigoted views .
i 'm proud my state allows gay marriage , and big cheers for canada and spain !
dean , boston , ma , usa as a married woman with two children , i congratulate canada for allowing others - sisters and brothers - to share in the same depth of relationship which i fortunately enjoy .
shame to all those who prohibit others from love and life .
annette , philadelphia pa free will and equal rights .
if a gay couple wants to be married it is strictly their business .
no one tries to stop and no one argues the validity of a heterosexual couple 's marriage and as far as adoption goes , with so many children out there waiting to become part of a loving home , the more couples willing to adopt the better .
live and let live .
no one should take satisfaction in destroying another person 's chance at expressing their love in a permanent honourable fashion .
romee trofort , alexandria , va us equality and discrimination should be abolished wherever possible - if this includes giving full marriage rights to same sex partners then same sex marriage should be available and be open in as many places as possible .
thomas kubot , netherlands this is a slap in the face on my belief structure rodolfo , cincinnati , usa sad , very sad .
this is a slap in the face on my belief structure .
how can i teach my kids what is right if the world says what i believe is wrong ?
this is the impact of gay marriage .
rodolfo , cincinnati , usa congrats on passing your new law and showing the world that you stand for all human rights !
i wish our country would do the same .
i admire you all greatly !
congratulations !
gene , andover , minn . , usa it 's an important moment , knowing that when i finally fall in love , i 'll be able to solemnize our relationship like any other couple .
i 'm proud of our politicians for taking a step forward .
tim , toronto , canada i do n't see why any country recognizes marriage in the first place .
after all a separation of church and state should mean that the state would recognize only civil unions -lrb- which would be between all type hetero or homosexual couples -rrb- .
tristan benson , richmond , va .
deeply saddened by the politics and ethics that lead to this decision that hardly reflects the wishes or viewpoint of the majority of canadians .
it is not merely the conservative religious segment of canadian society , but also many ethnic cultural groups that are disapproving of this redefinition of the word " marriage " .
lisa , cambridge , canada last night was a great moment for canada and for the rest of the world .
thanks to all mps who voted in favour of the bill and to all other people who worked for this over the years !
spain will hopefully follow the lead later this week .
sami , helsinki , finland i 'm proud to be a canadian today !
s. terra , winnipeg manitoba canada congratulations canada !
it must be great living in a country where everyone is equal .
paul , bellingham , wa usa i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship patrick , madison , wisconsin , us canada has once again come to the forefront , while the united states , that bastion of " freedom " , is ready to do the opposite .
i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship .
if you disagree or disapprove , that is what your voice , your church , and your living room is for , but dissenters should not be allowed to take me away from my partner , bar me from his bedside , or prevent us from caring for each other , physically , spiritually , or financially .
patrick , madison , wisconsin , us i think this is an amazing day for us and the rest of the country , i can finally marry the one i love .
raymond parker , dieppe nb the orientation i was born with is heterosexual .
because this is " approved " i could be married anywhere .
but , if i marry again , i want to marry in canada where all persons have rights .
jim lawson , leonard ok , usa the passage of this bill does not reflect the values of the typical canadian .
if parliament had had the courage to submit this to a national referendum there is no doubt that it would have gone down to a resounding defeat .
pete , vancouver , canada i see nothing but positive coming from this .
gays and lesbians no longer have to suffer the heartbreaking issues that they had to endure by not having equal standing .
i am sure that the straight population will see that we have not lost anything and we have allowed people dignity .
i am overjoyed !
greg pressey , tillsonburg , canada this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities thom , montreal , canada this is a logical next step in the evolution of modern society .
homosexuals in canada have been waiting since 1967 -lrb- when homosexuality was decriminalized -rrb- for this day .
this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities .
i am from quebec and advocate the separation of this province from the rest of the country , but on a day like today i ca n't help but feel proud to live in canada .
thom seivewright , montreal , canada i think this is excellent !
honestly , what 's so wrong about gay people getting married ?
they 're not hurting anyone .
as for the ' true definition of marriage ' i think that 's a joke , what with shows like ' marry my dad ' how can they say that with a straight face ?
theresa , ontario , canada i have to say this is news that makes my heart happy .
people need to realize that true equality goes across the board - marriage should be for all , not just heterosexuals .
this is a step in the right direction !
usa , are you paying attention ?
peter , east greenwich , rhode island , usa being canadian , i am proud of the politicians who sided with freedom of choice and the people 's wish .
intolerance and despotism have no place in politic in a civilized world .
michel tremblay , canada it 's a matter of equal rights and balancing minority rights against the greater population .
it does n't affect my wife 's and my marriage in any way at all .
perhaps those who are so offended by it can now put their attention to canada 's high divorce rate -lrb- among heterosexual couples of course -rrb- .
gary , nelson , canada as a canadian living in england with my english partner of 5 years , we 're both proud to wave the canadian flag today !
canada is now a shining example to america and the rest of the world of the true and proper way to recognise the rights of all people , and not just those who follow an established religious code of ethics .
as prime minister paul martin has said , equal rights for minority groups is not something you can simply pick and choose .
r. fraser , london , uk we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage edward , london i 've been living with my canadian partner for over 10 years now and i welcome this legislation .
it means we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage , rather than put up with the second class " civil partnership " which the government is introducing here .
edward , london ca n't believe our politicians spent so much time on this issue !
i 'm definitely not against equal rights for gay couples but no matter what the politicians say , to me marriage will always be a union between a man and a woman .
mark , ottawa , canada as much as the religious right complain , i do n't see this having any impact on heterosexual couples , married or otherwise .
the facts are that parliament would have had to invoke the not withstanding clause to take a different course and what would that mean for gay couples that have already married after the high courts found that this was a charter of rights issue ?
personally i think the " live and let live " motto works for me and i would remind the religious right that the same charter protects their rights to practise whatever religion they want .
they are a lot bigger issues facing canadian society that deserve our attention .
mack , ottawa , canada congratulations canada .
spain is next and hopefully many countries will follow .
about time gay people were treated equal .
ricardo yerro , pamplona , spain equality at last ! ! !
this was never a simple debate about a word .
this was : for all of those people who have been beaten to death simply for being who they are ; for all of those people who have taken their own lives , either as young people afraid of what they were feeling , or others in heterosexual marriages and not knowing what to do with their truth -lrb- and there are far , far too many of these people -rrb- ; for all of those people who marched " before it was popular " and were greeted by rocks and sticks instead of cheers .
for anyone , anywhere who faces inequality , bigotry and prejudice , this is a victory for all of us who would fight against those trying to deny us what they have so comfortably enjoyed for years .
i am personally overwhelmed , and fiercely proud to be a canadian this morning !
len t milley , toronto , canada i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed t. mooney , oakville , ontario the liberal minority government had no mandate from the canadian electorate to pass this bill .
i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed .
t. mooney , oakville , ontario at least in canada , all citizens are truly created equal .
i celebrate my 20th anniversary with my husband this coming week -lrb- yes , we 're gay -rrb- .
if finances and circumstances were different , a trip to canada would have been lovely !
at least our neighbours to the north have it right .
god bless them and god bless canada ! ! !
clay dove , dallas , tx , usa as much as i was against this bill and still am , please politicians can we just get on with running the country ?
i am sure that there are more important issues that deserve to take up just as much of your valuable time and need as much passion and debate .
susan chambers , oshawa , ontario , canada i 've no doubt that there will be howls of protest over this but in a truly fair and equal secular society it is perfectly right that gay men and women should have the right to an officially recognised life bond and the term marriage is as good as any who knows they might take it more seriously than a large number of heterosexuals do !
tim , plymouth , uk this is a proud moment for canada and the world .
it also offers another example of how to build an open and inclusive democratic society in contrast to the high state of fear and anxiety demonstrated by our neighbours to the south .
america needs us more than their leaders know .
tom , ottawa , canada this is dark day for canadian families .
polls indicate that a national referendum would show more than 70 % of canadians oppose the bill , and want to leave marriage as between a man and a woman .
james , freelton , on , canada fantastic !
hurrah !
canadians had it right when they said they were welcoming and inclusive .
perhaps the other north american country can learn to follow suit .
what a day for celebration that would be .

spain 's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages , making it the fourth country in the world to do so .
the spanish bill will become law in a month 's time , putting same-sex and heterosexual marriages on the same legal footing including the right to adopt children .
do you approve of same-sex marriage ?
would you consider travelling to either belgium , canada , the netherlands or spain to get married ?
should gay couples have the same rights as heterosexuals ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages balaji , chennai , india first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages .
let the world stop forcing its religious views upon the larger community .
balaji , chennai , india regardless of whether i am comfortable with homosexuality or not , i feel very strongly that it is none of my business how other people live their lives , especially their sex lives .
what really makes me cringe is when a group of people are denied their right to pursue happiness because they do not fit into the stereotypical mythical , white , christian 1950 's family unit complete with stay-at-home mom and all-knowing , strong , law-giving dad .
the constitution never specified freedom and equality only " within the boundaries of the christian conservative church " .
rhonda , houston , tx , usa to those who reject gay marriage on the basis of gay couples not being able to reproduce : what about heterosexual couples who can not or will not have children ?
should they be denied marriage also ?
mikko , finland the time appears to have come for gay marriages to be recognised more and more .
not only are nations increasingly recognising what 's natural and right but our church has decided at the atlanta convention to support gay marriage .
i 'm proud to be a part of my congregational church which is open and affirming in its views and i look forward to hearing from our minister when she returns .

people need to realize that true equality goes across the board - marriage should be for all , not just heterosexuals .
this is a step in the right direction !
usa , are you paying attention ?
peter , east greenwich , rhode island , usa being canadian , i am proud of the politicians who sided with freedom of choice and the people 's wish .
intolerance and despotism have no place in politic in a civilized world .
michel tremblay , canada it 's a matter of equal rights and balancing minority rights against the greater population .
it does n't affect my wife 's and my marriage in any way at all .
perhaps those who are so offended by it can now put their attention to canada 's high divorce rate -lrb- among heterosexual couples of course -rrb- .
gary , nelson , canada as a canadian living in england with my english partner of 5 years , we 're both proud to wave the canadian flag today !
canada is now a shining example to america and the rest of the world of the true and proper way to recognise the rights of all people , and not just those who follow an established religious code of ethics .
as prime minister paul martin has said , equal rights for minority groups is not something you can simply pick and choose .
r. fraser , london , uk we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage edward , london i 've been living with my canadian partner for over 10 years now and i welcome this legislation .
it means we can now go to canada to have a proper marriage , rather than put up with the second class " civil partnership " which the government is introducing here .
edward , london ca n't believe our politicians spent so much time on this issue !
i 'm definitely not against equal rights for gay couples but no matter what the politicians say , to me marriage will always be a union between a man and a woman .
mark , ottawa , canada as much as the religious right complain , i do n't see this having any impact on heterosexual couples , married or otherwise .
the facts are that parliament would have had to invoke the not withstanding clause to take a different course and what would that mean for gay couples that have already married after the high courts found that this was a charter of rights issue ?
personally i think the " live and let live " motto works for me and i would remind the religious right that the same charter protects their rights to practise whatever religion they want .
they are a lot bigger issues facing canadian society that deserve our attention .
mack , ottawa , canada congratulations canada .
spain is next and hopefully many countries will follow .
about time gay people were treated equal .
ricardo yerro , pamplona , spain equality at last ! ! !
this was never a simple debate about a word .
this was : for all of those people who have been beaten to death simply for being who they are ; for all of those people who have taken their own lives , either as young people afraid of what they were feeling , or others in heterosexual marriages and not knowing what to do with their truth -lrb- and there are far , far too many of these people -rrb- ; for all of those people who marched " before it was popular " and were greeted by rocks and sticks instead of cheers .
for anyone , anywhere who faces inequality , bigotry and prejudice , this is a victory for all of us who would fight against those trying to deny us what they have so comfortably enjoyed for years .
i am personally overwhelmed , and fiercely proud to be a canadian this morning !
len t milley , toronto , canada i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed t. mooney , oakville , ontario the liberal minority government had no mandate from the canadian electorate to pass this bill .
i am outraged that the definition of marriage in canada has been changed .
t. mooney , oakville , ontario at least in canada , all citizens are truly created equal .
i celebrate my 20th anniversary with my husband this coming week -lrb- yes , we 're gay -rrb- .
if finances and circumstances were different , a trip to canada would have been lovely !
at least our neighbours to the north have it right .
god bless them and god bless canada ! ! !
clay dove , dallas , tx , usa as much as i was against this bill and still am , please politicians can we just get on with running the country ?
i am sure that there are more important issues that deserve to take up just as much of your valuable time and need as much passion and debate .
susan chambers , oshawa , ontario , canada i 've no doubt that there will be howls of protest over this but in a truly fair and equal secular society it is perfectly right that gay men and women should have the right to an officially recognised life bond and the term marriage is as good as any who knows they might take it more seriously than a large number of heterosexuals do !
tim , plymouth , uk this is a proud moment for canada and the world .
it also offers another example of how to build an open and inclusive democratic society in contrast to the high state of fear and anxiety demonstrated by our neighbours to the south .
america needs us more than their leaders know .
tom , ottawa , canada this is dark day for canadian families .
polls indicate that a national referendum would show more than 70 % of canadians oppose the bill , and want to leave marriage as between a man and a woman .
james , freelton , on , canada fantastic !
hurrah !
canadians had it right when they said they were welcoming and inclusive .
perhaps the other north american country can learn to follow suit .
what a day for celebration that would be .

spain 's lower house of parliament has voted in favour of allowing same-sex marriages , making it the fourth country in the world to do so .
the spanish bill will become law in a month 's time , putting same-sex and heterosexual marriages on the same legal footing including the right to adopt children .
do you approve of same-sex marriage ?
would you consider travelling to either belgium , canada , the netherlands or spain to get married ?
should gay couples have the same rights as heterosexuals ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : " first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages " balaji , chennai , india first let the world respect homosexuals as equals , before we begin talking about gay marriages .
let the world stop forcing its religious views upon the larger community .
balaji , chennai , india regardless of whether i am comfortable with homosexuality or not , i feel very strongly that it is none of my business how other people live their lives , especially their sex lives .
what really makes me cringe is when a group of people are denied their right to pursue happiness because they do not fit into the stereotypical mythical , white , christian 1950 's family unit complete with stay-at-home mom and all-knowing , strong , law-giving dad .
the constitution never specified freedom and equality only " within the boundaries of the christian conservative church " .
rhonda , houston , tx , usa to those who reject gay marriage on the basis of gay couples not being able to reproduce : what about heterosexual couples who can not or will not have children ?
should they be denied marriage also ?
mikko , finland the time appears to have come for gay marriages to be recognised more and more .
not only are nations increasingly recognising what 's natural and right but our church has decided at the atlanta convention to support gay marriage .
i 'm proud to be a part of my congregational church which is open and affirming in its views and i look forward to hearing from our minister when she returns .
dale lanan , longmont , colorado , usa i totally agree with civil marriage between homosexuals .
i know of a gay couple who were ' disowned ' by their parents when they decided to live together .
but when one of them fell ill and died , all of a sudden his family came to claim his possessions .
in a heterosexual marriage all that would belong to the spouse , but his partner was left with nothing and still is paying off debt from the medical costs from his partner 's illness .
i strongly believe in human rights and equality for all peoples and hope that very soon many more people will accept and embrace one another 's beliefs and rights .
fraiser , thailand as far as it is a civil marriage , there is no problem .
but it should not in anyway lead to child adoption .
it is a matter of human right and a child has the full right to have a mother and a father .
chadi , lebanon i love my country but it 's sad that the united states is so far behind when it comes to treating everyone as equal .
homosexuals , african americans , latinos , asians , jews , muslims , people with disabilities and anyone else considered ' different ' will know where i 'm coming from .
our country still holds the greatest influence in the world and i ask everyone to pray for our nation and our world in times of challenges between social and international issues that can impact our globe .
walter g , palm harbor , florida we are not against civil unions for homosexuals , i mean , they have to have exactly the same rights than heterosexuals in paying taxes -lrb- here in spain you can pay taxes on your own or with your couple -rrb- , widowed pension , and all civil rights you have just for marrying .
we are against the word " matrimonio " in spanish , just because the word includes " matri " that means mother , and they ca n't be mothers , so why do n't they just call it civil unions ?
they say that that involves an implicit discrimination , but i do n't think so , is just calling things by its own name .
aurelio de la puerta , seville , spain my partner , who 's british , and i are one of the 5,000 couples queuing up to marry in spain .
pm zapatero should be applauded for his progressive stance while other leaders in so-called more liberal northern europe shy away from allowing full equality .
i 'd add that it seems strange to take moral authority from the catholic church , an institution that has failed to address the issue of paedophile priests effectively , while its stand against the use of condoms has caused the deaths of millions of people from aids in africa .
aleksandar atanasov , malaga , spain in my opinion , the matter of same-sex marriages would not have been such a trouble if the religious right and similar people in europe had not made it a huge issue .
so members of non-heterosexual minorities want to marry each other ?
let them .
they regard it as a right , when their opponents would like to rid them of all rights -lrb- including health care -rrb- .
v lehtinen , tampere , finland " gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide " becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states gay marriage ought to be legalised worldwide .
in the united states , the government champions equality , but does not follow through .
it is important that gays join african-americans and women in being liberated and being treated as equals .
gays are people too , and deserve to be treated as such .
becky hartung , idaho falls , id , united states i understand both sides of this issue .
however , at the end of the day it is all about equality .
the religious right has to understand that stripping one group of their rights leads to a slippery slope that will one day have them stripped of theirs .
let 's be reasonable and fair to all .
i live as an equal .
i am a canadian !
michael talon , toronto , on , canada i believe couples with children carry the weight of a country by creating taxpayers etc .
homosexual couples can not give birth to children thus should not be allowed to have normal marriage rights .
this does not mean they are not human , it 's different .
john , melbourne we can not go on with such closed minds ! !
i know several gay couples and they all seem more committed to each other than most heterosexual couples .
they should have the same rights as anyone else .
they have the same emotions and the want for company that any human does .
gay people are not monsters , they are just like you and me and should not be persecuted like so many minorities are and have been throughout history .
zoe , hertfordshire , uk " homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do " cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa < homosexual couples should have all the same rights as heterosexual couples do , and there is no justification for opinions that state otherwise .
the purpose of marriage is to allow two people that love each other to be united in a beautiful bond , and this should not be denied to those whose sexual preferences are different from the majority .
cory schneider , charlotte , nc , usa first they say that gays are too promiscuous .
then they get upset when we want to get married in a committed relationship .
religious fanatics seem so confused .
bernie , denver , co , usa we 're not talking about a church service but a civil marriage .
gays like any people have their civil rights like any other member of society .
roger pacheco , san francisco , usa it is to be expected that in an age of individualism coupled with rejection of universal morality that " gay marriage " should become increasingly acceptable .
in the long haul of history it is a sign of social and cultural decay .
william miller , kansas city , mo , usa why should any country hold a referendum on this issue ?
why should any majority have the right to decide on the human rights of any minority that is not breaking the law ?
there would still be segregation in the usa if the people there had had a referendum on racial equality in the 1960 's .
stephen , belfast ni " the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed " emily fogarty , smithfield , ri i can not believe this is happening .
it 's purely unnatural .
the purpose of marriage will be lost and its sanctity destroyed .
emily fogarty , smithfield , ri to those who cry for national referendums and mandates from the electorate , i say this : basic human and civil rights are meant to protect minorities against majority oppression , not the other way around .
honestly , america 's brain drain will be canada 's gain .
if our country can not provide its citizens with the protections they need and deserve , expect nothing less than a mass exodus .
hopping the border is looking increasingly attractive ...
ellen , cincinnati , oh , usa reading many of the comments it seems that many parents are raising their children to believe that the love between gay couples is worth less than that between a man and a woman .
what nonsense .
also , gay people are n't trying to hijack a religious ceremony .
they are trying to enjoy the civil unions already afforded to straight couples .
why is there so much bitterness over the right for people in love to express themselves ?
david s , london , uk same sex marriage is about human rights .
arguments against this are simply prejudice and hatred disguised by religion and tradition .
christopher borycheski , toronto , canada " whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant " dean , boston , ma , usa whether you personally disapprove of gay marriage is irrelevant .
that should not preclude people around the world from enjoying equal rights and protections given to everybody else .
most opponents of gay marriage behave as if it would be mandatory and use the unbelievably selfish argument , " i do n't like this so you ca n't do it . "
these opponents of equality have no concept of what a free society is all about and will one day be ashamed of their backwards and bigoted views .
i 'm proud my state allows gay marriage , and big cheers for canada and spain !
dean , boston , ma , usa as a married woman with two children , i congratulate canada for allowing others - sisters and brothers - to share in the same depth of relationship which i fortunately enjoy .
shame to all those who prohibit others from love and life .
annette , philadelphia pa free will and equal rights .
if a gay couple wants to be married it is strictly their business .
no one tries to stop and no one argues the validity of a heterosexual couple 's marriage and as far as adoption goes , with so many children out there waiting to become part of a loving home , the more couples willing to adopt the better .
live and let live .
no one should take satisfaction in destroying another person 's chance at expressing their love in a permanent honourable fashion .
romee trofort , alexandria , va us equality and discrimination should be abolished wherever possible - if this includes giving full marriage rights to same sex partners then same sex marriage should be available and be open in as many places as possible .
thomas kubot , netherlands " this is a slap in the face on my belief structure " rodolfo , cincinnati , usa sad , very sad .
this is a slap in the face on my belief structure .
how can i teach my kids what is right if the world says what i believe is wrong ?
this is the impact of gay marriage .
rodolfo , cincinnati , usa congrats on passing your new law and showing the world that you stand for all human rights !
i wish our country would do the same .
i admire you all greatly !
congratulations !
gene , andover , minn . , usa it 's an important moment , knowing that when i finally fall in love , i 'll be able to solemnize our relationship like any other couple .
i 'm proud of our politicians for taking a step forward .
tim , toronto , canada i do n't see why any country recognizes marriage in the first place .
after all a separation of church and state should mean that the state would recognize only civil unions -lrb- which would be between all type hetero or homosexual couples -rrb- .
tristan benson , richmond , va .
deeply saddened by the politics and ethics that lead to this decision that hardly reflects the wishes or viewpoint of the majority of canadians .
it is not merely the conservative religious segment of canadian society , but also many ethnic cultural groups that are disapproving of this redefinition of the word " marriage " .
lisa , cambridge , canada last night was a great moment for canada and for the rest of the world .
thanks to all mps who voted in favour of the bill and to all other people who worked for this over the years !
spain will hopefully follow the lead later this week .
sami , helsinki , finland i 'm proud to be a canadian today !
s. terra , winnipeg manitoba canada congratulations canada !
it must be great living in a country where everyone is equal .
paul , bellingham , wa usa " i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship " patrick , madison , wisconsin , us canada has once again come to the forefront , while the united states , that bastion of " freedom " , is ready to do the opposite .
i am still at a loss at how allowing two men or two women to marry diminishes a heterosexual relationship .
if you disagree or disapprove , that is what your voice , your church , and your living room is for , but dissenters should not be allowed to take me away from my partner , bar me from his bedside , or prevent us from caring for each other , physically , spiritually , or financially .
patrick , madison , wisconsin , us i think this is an amazing day for us and the rest of the country , i can finally marry the one i love .
raymond parker , dieppe nb the orientation i was born with is heterosexual .
because this is " approved " i could be married anywhere .
but , if i marry again , i want to marry in canada where all persons have rights .
jim lawson , leonard ok , usa the passage of this bill does not reflect the values of the typical canadian .
if parliament had had the courage to submit this to a national referendum there is no doubt that it would have gone down to a resounding defeat .
pete , vancouver , canada i see nothing but positive coming from this .
gays and lesbians no longer have to suffer the heartbreaking issues that they had to endure by not having equal standing .
i am sure that the straight population will see that we have not lost anything and we have allowed people dignity .
i am overjoyed !
greg pressey , tillsonburg , canada " this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities " thom , montreal , canada this is a logical next step in the evolution of modern society .
homosexuals in canada have been waiting since 1967 -lrb- when homosexuality was decriminalized -rrb- for this day .
this legislation is a shining example of the vast difference between canadian and american mentalities .
i am from quebec and advocate the separation of this province from the rest of the country , but on a day like today i ca n't help but feel proud to live in canada .
thom seivewright , montreal , canada i think this is excellent !
honestly , what 's so wrong about gay people getting married ?
they 're not hurting anyone .
as for the ' true definition of marriage ' i think that 's a joke , what with shows like ' marry my dad ' how can they say that with a straight face ?
theresa , ontario , canada i have to say this is news that makes my heart happy .

angela cannings , originally from wilts , said prof meadow should be " severely punished " after the lancet 's editor , dr richard horton , spoke in his defence .
dr horton said prof meadow should not take the blame for a faulty system .
prof meadow could be struck off if found guilty of serious professional misconduct , which he denies .
' misconceived pursuit ' the general medical council -lrb- gmc -rrb- disciplinary hearing is over evidence prof meadow gave in the trial of sally clark in 1999 who was jailed for killing her sons christopher and harry .
her conviction was overturned by the court of appeal in 2003 .
dr horton argued prof meadow had provided the " lightning rod of blame " for the wrongful conviction of mrs clark .
but he added : " this misconceived pursuit of one man is wrong and threatens the effective delivery of child protection services in britain . "
dr horton said prof meadow should never have been referred to the gmc , and should not have to take the blame for a system that was at fault .
mrs cannings , 42 , was found guilty in 2002 of smothering her seven-week-old son jason in 1991 and 18-week-old michael in 1997 largely on the strength of prof meadow 's evidence .
she was later released by the court of appeal .
she said : " there has always been someone who will say he is not guilty . "
she said she agreed in some ways that the system needed to be changed , but argued prof meadow should still be held accountable .
mrs cannings , originally from salisbury , said : " roy meadow has been present in a number of these cases so it is no wonder he is being vilified .
" what the authorities have to do is start punishing the ones who do get it wrong and learn from what has happened to make sure the ones who are getting it right are given enough praise and back-up . "

angela cannings , originally from wilts , said prof meadow should be " severely punished " after the lancet 's editor , dr richard horton , spoke in his defence .
dr horton said prof meadow should not take the blame for a faulty system .
prof meadow could be struck off if found guilty of serious professional misconduct , which he denies .
' misconceived pursuit ' the general medical council -lrb- gmc -rrb- disciplinary hearing is over evidence prof meadow gave in the trial of sally clark in 1999 who was jailed for killing her sons christopher and harry .
her conviction was overturned by the court of appeal in 2003 .
dr horton argued prof meadow had provided the " lightning rod of blame " for the wrongful conviction of mrs clark .
but he added : " this misconceived pursuit of one man is wrong and threatens the effective delivery of child protection services in britain . "
sir roy denies any serious professional misconduct dr horton said prof meadow should never have been referred to the gmc , and should not have to take the blame for a system that was at fault .
mrs cannings , 42 , was found guilty in 2002 of smothering her seven-week-old son jason in 1991 and 18-week-old michael in 1997 largely on the strength of prof meadow 's evidence .
