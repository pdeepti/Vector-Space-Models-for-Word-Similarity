chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .

schröder also called on the opposition to end the debate over the volume of the reconstruction aid as promised by the government .
he said conservatives had no reason to worry over how berlin would raise the € 500 million -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- it has pledged . " this year we ’ ve got a budget of € 251 billion .
if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .
so , we ’ re talking about a meager 0.04 percent a year , just to put things in perspective . " two conservative state premiers , edmund stoiber in bavaria and christian wulff in lower saxony have both called into question how germany will finance its aid pledge .
that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster . " i 've rarely seen - and you know i pay close attention to money - such bean counting as i have from mr. wulff and mr. stoiber regarding the flood catastrophe , " german finance minister hans eichel said according to the reuters news agency . at a memorial service in commemoration of the tsunami victims in berlin on sunday , state and church leaders said they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all who are mourning the loss of their loved ones .

creditor nations meet this week to discuss the matter . foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday in jakarta , indonesia , that the german government would consider providing more than just a suspension of debt payments for the country hardest hit by the underwater earthquake and tsunami on december 26 .
" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "
on wednesday , the creditor nations of the paris club are meeting to consider a debt moratorium for sri lanka and indonesia .
for indonesia , a debt moratorium is of extreme importance .

at 5:00 am local time -lrb- 22:00 utc -rrb- , residents of banda aceh ran out onto the streets in panic after a powerful 6.2 aftershock struck the already badly destroyed city .
there were no immediate reports of casualties .
also , a us military helicopter crashed in a rice paddy during a relief mission in aceh province .
officials said no one died in the crash but all on board were taken to a hospital .
the us military at first halted all helicopter flights but then soon resumed them in a scaled-back operation .
there was no indication that the helicopter went down due to ground fire , but in the past few days , firefights have taken place between the indonesian army and the rebel group gam who is demanding an independent state in aceh .
foreign relief workers have yet to be affected by the fighting but fischer did discuss the matter with president yudhoyono .
fischer said after the meeting he had the impression indonesia realized how necessary it was for the helpers to be able to work in a peaceful environment .
travel restrictions to thailand before arriving in indonesia , fischer toured thailand where he promised bangkok continued assistance , particularly for schools destroyed by the tsunami .
according to the foreign minister , thais have greatly accepted german aid so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai man carries a bag as he walks past two westerners taking a sun bath in phuket regarding travel to the ravaged southeast asian country , fischer said restrictions would remain in place .
" when something happens again , people will rightfully ask , why we were n't diligent enough .

sixty germans have been confirmed dead so far , but since the early days of the disaster on december 26 , the government had said it believed the number of missing to be around 1,000 .
a statement from the german government 's crisis unit for the tsunami said : " the current number of missing people reported to police in germany ... is now 719 people .
it must unfortunately be expected that the actual number of missing germans is much higher . "
the majority of missing germans were on holiday in thailand at the southern beach resorts around phuket when the giant earthquake-triggered waves crashed into the coast .
german foreign minister joschka fischer visited phuket on sunday and said the priority was now to identify nearly 2,000 bodies there whose nationality can not be determined because they are decomposing .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages .

but he will need a lot of support now if there is to be a fresh start in relations with israel . mahmoud abbas has been elected .
the news hardly comes as a surprise , since for weeks leading up to the election , observers predicted the plo leader would get a two-thirds majority .
and even though yasser arafat got 88.8 percent of the vote in 1996 , abbas can be satisfied with his result .
the election went smoothly , and the palestinians caught a whiff of fresh air - the air of democracy , and a new beginning . despite this , everyone - abbas especially - is aware that the real struggle has only just begun .
the fight for votes will now be turned into the fight to realize the palestinian dream - a dream that has , over the last 80 years , caused enormous suffering .
the dream was perhaps furthest away at those very moments when it appeared to be so tangible - when over and over , the palestinians resorted to violence in the belief that it could solve what was impossible to solve , and still can not be solved . for this reason , abbas is calling for a peaceful struggle .
he has repeatedly criticized the intifada of the past four years , because it has only hurt the palestinians .
instead , he will rely on negotiations and diplomacy . it is in this respect that abbas most sets himself apart from arafat , although he certainly would n't distance himself from his predecessor , so strong is arafat 's position as the icon of the palestinian movement . action from israel israel , however , should not deceive itself .
the difference lies in style , not in the goal .
abbas also wants a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital .
he wants israel to withdraw from palestinian territories , to give up its settlements , and he wants a solution to the problem of palestinian refugees , to name just a few issues on which he won the election . mahmoud abbas will need a massive amount of support if he is to reach these goals .
and it would be disastrous , were israel to now solely concentrate on demanding an end to the violence from him .
abbas has spoken out against violence , he wants to reform and democratize palestinian society - his two-thirds majority shows that the palestinians support this .
they also think it 's right for abbas , as he promised , to begin negotiations with israel . for israel , this means a quick completion of its withdrawal from the gaza strip - as a precursor for further withdrawals .
additionally , israel should dismantle the restrictions it has placed on the palestinians ' freedom of movement , for example , the monstrous separation barrier of walls and fences . nobody is telling israel to give up its right to security , but true security can only come from a free and democratic palestine .

creditor nations meet this week to discuss the matter . foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday in jakarta , indonesia , that the german government would consider providing more than just a suspension of debt payments for the country hardest hit by the underwater earthquake and tsunami on december 26 .
" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "

the us military at first halted all helicopter flights but then soon resumed them in a scaled-back operation .
there was no indication that the helicopter went down due to ground fire , but in the past few days , firefights have taken place between the indonesian army and the rebel group gam who is demanding an independent state in aceh .
foreign relief workers have yet to be affected by the fighting but fischer did discuss the matter with president yudhoyono .
fischer said after the meeting he had the impression indonesia realized how necessary it was for the helpers to be able to work in a peaceful environment .
travel restrictions to thailand before arriving in indonesia , fischer toured thailand where he promised bangkok continued assistance , particularly for schools destroyed by the tsunami .

" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "

foreign relief workers have yet to be affected by the fighting but fischer did discuss the matter with president yudhoyono .
fischer said after the meeting he had the impression indonesia realized how necessary it was for the helpers to be able to work in a peaceful environment .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .

he said conservatives had no reason to worry over how berlin would raise the € 500 million -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- it has pledged . " this year we ’ ve got a budget of € 251 billion .
if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .
so , we ’ re talking about a meager 0.04 percent a year , just to put things in perspective . " two conservative state premiers , edmund stoiber in bavaria and christian wulff in lower saxony have both called into question how germany will finance its aid pledge .
that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster . " i 've rarely seen - and you know i pay close attention to money - such bean counting as i have from mr. wulff and mr. stoiber regarding the flood catastrophe , " german finance minister hans eichel said according to the reuters news agency . at a memorial service in commemoration of the tsunami victims in berlin on sunday , state and church leaders said they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all who are mourning the loss of their loved ones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.01.2005 german visions of tomorrow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year , we 'll dress like proper ladies and gentlemen , experts say wondering what 's in store in 2005 ?
german experts have spoken : from fashion and leisure to cultural and political events , trend researchers make it their business to know what 's hot and what 's not in the year ahead . lest you think trend researchers only care about predicting which shade of lipstick will be a best-seller -lrb- for 2005 , think pink and red-orange , by the way -rrb- roman retzbach is quick to correct .
the head of the future institute in berlin said 70 percent of his work is aimed at politicians and influential leaders within the united nations and the european union . " trend research has gained more relevance in the post sept .
11 era , " retzbach said .
" before , politicians got trend reports and said , ' how nice ! ' and then tucked them away in their desks .
that 's changing .
today , the president of the united states has a future expert among his consultants .
trend experts are now important members of political teams . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , with chinese president hu jintao one of the big questions in 2004 , said retzbach , was whether turkey would join the eu .
he predicts that turkey 's candidacy will be successful , and adds that within 15 years , russia will also have joined the bloc .
indeed , russian president vladimir putin tops retzbach 's list of political leaders to watch in 2005 , along with chinese leader hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- . the cult of the individual trend forecasting has also become an indispensable part of the business world , as the marketing departments of major companies seek to better understand the consumer psyche , and in turn , increase sales .
german firms looking to strike it rich in 2005 would do well to note that , as in 2004 , the focus is on the individual . " germany has to catch up with the us here , " said peter wippermann , the founder of trend büro , a hamburg-based trend research company .
" there , for a longer time , customers have been the focus of attention .
in germany , we pay more attention to products , but that 's changing and companies are realizing they have to appeal to consumers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers line up outside the h & m store in frankfurt , germany for the lagerfeld collection and if there 's one thing that german individuals like , it 's getting a great deal .
that means discounters and the purveyors of " cheap chic , " such as clothing retailer hennes & mauritz -lrb- h & m -rrb- , can be expected to continue to do well in 2005 .
but retzbach said there 's an additional trend even these retailers should not ignore . " in society , lifestyle , and business , the key word is ' eventing , " ' he said .
" make something into an event , and people will come .
we saw this recently with electronics retailer media markt .
they put their prices down for one day , and people were willing to stand in line for two hours to pay for something . " discounting luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld , seen here with a model for his h & m collection , brought haute couture to the masses events that combine discounts and luxury are surefire winners , according to wippermann , who cited h & m 's recent venture with designer karl lagerfeld as a classic example .
lagerfeld 's limited edition " haute couture for the masses " sold out within hours at stores across europe , highlighting yet another consumer trend - " the importance of the moment , " as wippermann put it . " retailers are putting artificial time limits on the availability of products rather than saying , these are the products we have all the time , " he added . speaking of fashion , wippermann predicted that 2005 will see a return to stricter differentiation between the sexes , with women wearing the romantic , feminine styles of the 1950s , and men dressing either in classic suits , or sporty , athletic clothing . " fashion is really the last vestige for men and women to express their gender and sexuality , as in other realms , men and women have achieved more equality , " wippermann said . bye-bye big brother ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brad pitt 's star is predicted to rise even further in 2005 according to the future institute , among the other trends to watch out for in 2005 is the end of reality tv .
hard as it is to believe that we could tire of watching a group of talentless strangers cooped up in a container live out the minutiae of their daily lives , it seems the end is nigh for big brother & co . quality , scripted dramas are once again in demand .
on the big screen , count on seeing more of brad pitt and angelina jolie . and , in keeping with retzbach 's overall assessment that 2005 is the year of retro , two notable germans who will enjoy a comeback of sorts are physicist albert einstein and poet friedrich schiller : the two men died 50 and 200 years ago respectively . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld causes cheap chic craze all hell broke loose when the limited edition karl lagerfeld for h & m collection hit selected stores in germany friday .
-lrb- nov.12 , 2004 -rrb- shopping with style and bucking the low-spender trend from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry .
-lrb- april 8 , 2004 -rrb- german reality shows in need of reality check reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants .

it bans them from smoking in public places including bars , restaurants , discotheques and offices . there have been two delays in applying the regulation , but now the die is cast : as of monday , private homes , the open air or special places reserved for smokers will be the only places to light up .
plainclothes police will patrol the country 's 240,000 eating and drinking establishments on the lookout for miscreants , press reports said . asian tsunamis apart , no subject has dominated conversation more among the nation 's large bar and cafe population . only 5 percent of italy 's 240,000 bars and restaurants have special rooms for smokers , according to fip , the country 's trade association .
some landlords have threatened to boycott the law , warning they will not play sheriff to customers . majority in favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still open to smokers nevertheless , a public opinion poll has shown that 83 percent of italians are in favor of the new ban . many smokers seemed resigned , especially with promised fines of € 275 -lrb- $ 360 -rrb- for customers caught smoking , and up to € 2,200 for offending landlords .
but opposition remained strong to the end in this land of dedicated subversives , extending even up to cabinet level . parliament is setting an example with a rigorous ban on its premises despite protest from die-hard smokers in government and on the benches . " i 've been smoking since age 18 - it 's my sacred right , " italian defense minister antonio martino said in an interview with corriere della sera newspaper .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .

he said conservatives had no reason to worry over how berlin would raise the € 500 million -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- it has pledged . " this year we ’ ve got a budget of € 251 billion .
if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .
so , we ’ re talking about a meager 0.04 percent a year , just to put things in perspective . " two conservative state premiers , edmund stoiber in bavaria and christian wulff in lower saxony have both called into question how germany will finance its aid pledge .
that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster .

creditor nations meet this week to discuss the matter . foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday in jakarta , indonesia , that the german government would consider providing more than just a suspension of debt payments for the country hardest hit by the underwater earthquake and tsunami on december 26 .
" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "
on wednesday , the creditor nations of the paris club are meeting to consider a debt moratorium for sri lanka and indonesia .
for indonesia , a debt moratorium is of extreme importance .

there were no immediate reports of casualties .
also , a us military helicopter crashed in a rice paddy during a relief mission in aceh province .
officials said no one died in the crash but all on board were taken to a hospital .
the us military at first halted all helicopter flights but then soon resumed them in a scaled-back operation .
there was no indication that the helicopter went down due to ground fire , but in the past few days , firefights have taken place between the indonesian army and the rebel group gam who is demanding an independent state in aceh .
foreign relief workers have yet to be affected by the fighting but fischer did discuss the matter with president yudhoyono .
fischer said after the meeting he had the impression indonesia realized how necessary it was for the helpers to be able to work in a peaceful environment .
travel restrictions to thailand before arriving in indonesia , fischer toured thailand where he promised bangkok continued assistance , particularly for schools destroyed by the tsunami .
according to the foreign minister , thais have greatly accepted german aid so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai man carries a bag as he walks past two westerners taking a sun bath in phuket regarding travel to the ravaged southeast asian country , fischer said restrictions would remain in place .

germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .

there is a romance to exploring the soil under our feet – the remains of generations of humans before us , and prehistoric animals before them , the last artefacts of history , waiting to be found .
how much more romance is there , then , in exploring the ocean .
how much more romance , even , in exploring the floor of the ocean itself .
over 95 % of the ocean 's floor is unexplored .
many people – maybe even you – have not even had the idea of digging in there .
the joides resolution is a ship on a mission , one of the first of its kind .
it drilled beneath the earth at the bottom of the ocean .
but the ship didn ’ t just scrape the surface .
it went as far as 420 meters deep into that earth , and found the remains of organisms as old as 35 million years .
and also living creatures , eating those leftovers .

german experts have spoken : from fashion and leisure to cultural and political events , trend researchers make it their business to know what 's hot and what 's not in the year ahead . lest you think trend researchers only care about predicting which shade of lipstick will be a best-seller -lrb- for 2005 , think pink and red-orange , by the way -rrb- roman retzbach is quick to correct .
the head of the future institute in berlin said 70 percent of his work is aimed at politicians and influential leaders within the united nations and the european union . " trend research has gained more relevance in the post sept .
11 era , " retzbach said .
" before , politicians got trend reports and said , ' how nice ! ' and then tucked them away in their desks .
that 's changing .
today , the president of the united states has a future expert among his consultants .
trend experts are now important members of political teams . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , with chinese president hu jintao one of the big questions in 2004 , said retzbach , was whether turkey would join the eu .
he predicts that turkey 's candidacy will be successful , and adds that within 15 years , russia will also have joined the bloc .
indeed , russian president vladimir putin tops retzbach 's list of political leaders to watch in 2005 , along with chinese leader hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- . the cult of the individual trend forecasting has also become an indispensable part of the business world , as the marketing departments of major companies seek to better understand the consumer psyche , and in turn , increase sales .
german firms looking to strike it rich in 2005 would do well to note that , as in 2004 , the focus is on the individual . " germany has to catch up with the us here , " said peter wippermann , the founder of trend büro , a hamburg-based trend research company .
" there , for a longer time , customers have been the focus of attention .
in germany , we pay more attention to products , but that 's changing and companies are realizing they have to appeal to consumers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers line up outside the h & m store in frankfurt , germany for the lagerfeld collection and if there 's one thing that german individuals like , it 's getting a great deal .
that means discounters and the purveyors of " cheap chic , " such as clothing retailer hennes & mauritz -lrb- h & m -rrb- , can be expected to continue to do well in 2005 .
but retzbach said there 's an additional trend even these retailers should not ignore . " in society , lifestyle , and business , the key word is ' eventing , " ' he said .
" make something into an event , and people will come .
we saw this recently with electronics retailer media markt .
they put their prices down for one day , and people were willing to stand in line for two hours to pay for something . " discounting luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld , seen here with a model for his h & m collection , brought haute couture to the masses events that combine discounts and luxury are surefire winners , according to wippermann , who cited h & m 's recent venture with designer karl lagerfeld as a classic example .
lagerfeld 's limited edition " haute couture for the masses " sold out within hours at stores across europe , highlighting yet another consumer trend - " the importance of the moment , " as wippermann put it . " retailers are putting artificial time limits on the availability of products rather than saying , these are the products we have all the time , " he added . speaking of fashion , wippermann predicted that 2005 will see a return to stricter differentiation between the sexes , with women wearing the romantic , feminine styles of the 1950s , and men dressing either in classic suits , or sporty , athletic clothing . " fashion is really the last vestige for men and women to express their gender and sexuality , as in other realms , men and women have achieved more equality , " wippermann said . bye-bye big brother ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brad pitt 's star is predicted to rise even further in 2005 according to the future institute , among the other trends to watch out for in 2005 is the end of reality tv .
hard as it is to believe that we could tire of watching a group of talentless strangers cooped up in a container live out the minutiae of their daily lives , it seems the end is nigh for big brother & co . quality , scripted dramas are once again in demand .
on the big screen , count on seeing more of brad pitt and angelina jolie . and , in keeping with retzbach 's overall assessment that 2005 is the year of retro , two notable germans who will enjoy a comeback of sorts are physicist albert einstein and poet friedrich schiller : the two men died 50 and 200 years ago respectively . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld causes cheap chic craze all hell broke loose when the limited edition karl lagerfeld for h & m collection hit selected stores in germany friday .
-lrb- nov.12 , 2004 -rrb- shopping with style and bucking the low-spender trend from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry .
-lrb- april 8 , 2004 -rrb- german reality shows in need of reality check reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .

that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster . " i 've rarely seen - and you know i pay close attention to money - such bean counting as i have from mr. wulff and mr. stoiber regarding the flood catastrophe , " german finance minister hans eichel said according to the reuters news agency . at a memorial service in commemoration of the tsunami victims in berlin on sunday , state and church leaders said they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all who are mourning the loss of their loved ones .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .

creditor nations meet this week to discuss the matter . foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday in jakarta , indonesia , that the german government would consider providing more than just a suspension of debt payments for the country hardest hit by the underwater earthquake and tsunami on december 26 .
" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "

there were no immediate reports of casualties .
also , a us military helicopter crashed in a rice paddy during a relief mission in aceh province .
officials said no one died in the crash but all on board were taken to a hospital .
the us military at first halted all helicopter flights but then soon resumed them in a scaled-back operation .
there was no indication that the helicopter went down due to ground fire , but in the past few days , firefights have taken place between the indonesian army and the rebel group gam who is demanding an independent state in aceh .
foreign relief workers have yet to be affected by the fighting but fischer did discuss the matter with president yudhoyono .
fischer said after the meeting he had the impression indonesia realized how necessary it was for the helpers to be able to work in a peaceful environment .
travel restrictions to thailand before arriving in indonesia , fischer toured thailand where he promised bangkok continued assistance , particularly for schools destroyed by the tsunami .
according to the foreign minister , thais have greatly accepted german aid so far .

german experts have spoken : from fashion and leisure to cultural and political events , trend researchers make it their business to know what 's hot and what 's not in the year ahead . lest you think trend researchers only care about predicting which shade of lipstick will be a best-seller -lrb- for 2005 , think pink and red-orange , by the way -rrb- roman retzbach is quick to correct .
the head of the future institute in berlin said 70 percent of his work is aimed at politicians and influential leaders within the united nations and the european union . " trend research has gained more relevance in the post sept .
11 era , " retzbach said .
" before , politicians got trend reports and said , ' how nice ! ' and then tucked them away in their desks .
that 's changing .
today , the president of the united states has a future expert among his consultants .
trend experts are now important members of political teams . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , with chinese president hu jintao one of the big questions in 2004 , said retzbach , was whether turkey would join the eu .
he predicts that turkey 's candidacy will be successful , and adds that within 15 years , russia will also have joined the bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2005 schröder rejects sending jobless to tsunami areas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is south asia the answer to unemployed construction workers ?
chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .
5 pledge € 500 million for relief aid .
schröder also called on the opposition to end the debate over the volume of the reconstruction aid as promised by the government .
he said conservatives had no reason to worry over how berlin would raise the € 500 million -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- it has pledged . " this year we ’ ve got a budget of € 251 billion .
if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .

schröder also called on the opposition to end the debate over the volume of the reconstruction aid as promised by the government .
he said conservatives had no reason to worry over how berlin would raise the € 500 million -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- it has pledged . " this year we ’ ve got a budget of € 251 billion .
if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .
so , we ’ re talking about a meager 0.04 percent a year , just to put things in perspective . " two conservative state premiers , edmund stoiber in bavaria and christian wulff in lower saxony have both called into question how germany will finance its aid pledge .
that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster . " i 've rarely seen - and you know i pay close attention to money - such bean counting as i have from mr. wulff and mr. stoiber regarding the flood catastrophe , " german finance minister hans eichel said according to the reuters news agency . at a memorial service in commemoration of the tsunami victims in berlin on sunday , state and church leaders said they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all who are mourning the loss of their loved ones .

german experts have spoken : from fashion and leisure to cultural and political events , trend researchers make it their business to know what 's hot and what 's not in the year ahead . lest you think trend researchers only care about predicting which shade of lipstick will be a best-seller -lrb- for 2005 , think pink and red-orange , by the way -rrb- roman retzbach is quick to correct .
the head of the future institute in berlin said 70 percent of his work is aimed at politicians and influential leaders within the united nations and the european union . " trend research has gained more relevance in the post sept .
11 era , " retzbach said .
" before , politicians got trend reports and said , ' how nice ! ' and then tucked them away in their desks .
that 's changing .
today , the president of the united states has a future expert among his consultants .
trend experts are now important members of political teams . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , with chinese president hu jintao one of the big questions in 2004 , said retzbach , was whether turkey would join the eu .
he predicts that turkey 's candidacy will be successful , and adds that within 15 years , russia will also have joined the bloc .
indeed , russian president vladimir putin tops retzbach 's list of political leaders to watch in 2005 , along with chinese leader hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- . the cult of the individual trend forecasting has also become an indispensable part of the business world , as the marketing departments of major companies seek to better understand the consumer psyche , and in turn , increase sales .
german firms looking to strike it rich in 2005 would do well to note that , as in 2004 , the focus is on the individual . " germany has to catch up with the us here , " said peter wippermann , the founder of trend büro , a hamburg-based trend research company .
" there , for a longer time , customers have been the focus of attention .
in germany , we pay more attention to products , but that 's changing and companies are realizing they have to appeal to consumers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers line up outside the h & m store in frankfurt , germany for the lagerfeld collection and if there 's one thing that german individuals like , it 's getting a great deal .
that means discounters and the purveyors of " cheap chic , " such as clothing retailer hennes & mauritz -lrb- h & m -rrb- , can be expected to continue to do well in 2005 .
but retzbach said there 's an additional trend even these retailers should not ignore . " in society , lifestyle , and business , the key word is ' eventing , " ' he said .
" make something into an event , and people will come .
we saw this recently with electronics retailer media markt .
they put their prices down for one day , and people were willing to stand in line for two hours to pay for something . " discounting luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld , seen here with a model for his h & m collection , brought haute couture to the masses events that combine discounts and luxury are surefire winners , according to wippermann , who cited h & m 's recent venture with designer karl lagerfeld as a classic example .
lagerfeld 's limited edition " haute couture for the masses " sold out within hours at stores across europe , highlighting yet another consumer trend - " the importance of the moment , " as wippermann put it . " retailers are putting artificial time limits on the availability of products rather than saying , these are the products we have all the time , " he added . speaking of fashion , wippermann predicted that 2005 will see a return to stricter differentiation between the sexes , with women wearing the romantic , feminine styles of the 1950s , and men dressing either in classic suits , or sporty , athletic clothing . " fashion is really the last vestige for men and women to express their gender and sexuality , as in other realms , men and women have achieved more equality , " wippermann said . bye-bye big brother ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brad pitt 's star is predicted to rise even further in 2005 according to the future institute , among the other trends to watch out for in 2005 is the end of reality tv .
hard as it is to believe that we could tire of watching a group of talentless strangers cooped up in a container live out the minutiae of their daily lives , it seems the end is nigh for big brother & co . quality , scripted dramas are once again in demand .
on the big screen , count on seeing more of brad pitt and angelina jolie . and , in keeping with retzbach 's overall assessment that 2005 is the year of retro , two notable germans who will enjoy a comeback of sorts are physicist albert einstein and poet friedrich schiller : the two men died 50 and 200 years ago respectively . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld causes cheap chic craze all hell broke loose when the limited edition karl lagerfeld for h & m collection hit selected stores in germany friday .
-lrb- nov.12 , 2004 -rrb- shopping with style and bucking the low-spender trend from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry .
-lrb- april 8 , 2004 -rrb- german reality shows in need of reality check reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants .

creditor nations meet this week to discuss the matter . foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday in jakarta , indonesia , that the german government would consider providing more than just a suspension of debt payments for the country hardest hit by the underwater earthquake and tsunami on december 26 .
" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "
on wednesday , the creditor nations of the paris club are meeting to consider a debt moratorium for sri lanka and indonesia .
for indonesia , a debt moratorium is of extreme importance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief mission in indonesia continues unabated despite aftershock and helicopter mishap economic affairs minister aburizal bakrie said his country would like to freeze payments on $ 3.2 billion -lrb- € 2.46 billion -rrb- of debt until the year 2007 .
at that time , bakrie said , indonesia should be able to restart payments .
jakarta alone is $ 48 billion in debt .
another strong aftershock hits region rescue efforts in the region were hindered by two incidents on monday .
at 5:00 am local time -lrb- 22:00 utc -rrb- , residents of banda aceh ran out onto the streets in panic after a powerful 6.2 aftershock struck the already badly destroyed city .
there were no immediate reports of casualties .
also , a us military helicopter crashed in a rice paddy during a relief mission in aceh province .
officials said no one died in the crash but all on board were taken to a hospital .
the us military at first halted all helicopter flights but then soon resumed them in a scaled-back operation .
there was no indication that the helicopter went down due to ground fire , but in the past few days , firefights have taken place between the indonesian army and the rebel group gam who is demanding an independent state in aceh .
foreign relief workers have yet to be affected by the fighting but fischer did discuss the matter with president yudhoyono .
fischer said after the meeting he had the impression indonesia realized how necessary it was for the helpers to be able to work in a peaceful environment .
travel restrictions to thailand before arriving in indonesia , fischer toured thailand where he promised bangkok continued assistance , particularly for schools destroyed by the tsunami .
according to the foreign minister , thais have greatly accepted german aid so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thai man carries a bag as he walks past two westerners taking a sun bath in phuket regarding travel to the ravaged southeast asian country , fischer said restrictions would remain in place .
" when something happens again , people will rightfully ask , why we were n't diligent enough .

fischer added , however , that thailand relies on its tourism industry and that it is a double punishment for the country to be hit both by the natural disaster and then to be hit so hard economically . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans want lead role in alert system germany said saturday that it was prepared to lead efforts to help set up a tsunami alert system for the indian ocean within three years , relying on the use of e-mails and mobile phone text messages .

also , the vast oil reserves , found primarily in the south , will be divided evenly between the two sides .

over 70,000 people have died and at least 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes .
müller warned that the humanitarian crisis in darfur remained dramatic and required the world 's political and humanitarian commitment .
germany , she added , would continue its aid program to the troubled area in 2005 .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .
5 pledge € 500 million for relief aid .
schröder also called on the opposition to end the debate over the volume of the reconstruction aid as promised by the government .
he said conservatives had no reason to worry over how berlin would raise the € 500 million -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- it has pledged . " this year we ’ ve got a budget of € 251 billion .
if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .
so , we ’ re talking about a meager 0.04 percent a year , just to put things in perspective . " two conservative state premiers , edmund stoiber in bavaria and christian wulff in lower saxony have both called into question how germany will finance its aid pledge .
that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster . " i 've rarely seen - and you know i pay close attention to money - such bean counting as i have from mr. wulff and mr. stoiber regarding the flood catastrophe , " german finance minister hans eichel said according to the reuters news agency . at a memorial service in commemoration of the tsunami victims in berlin on sunday , state and church leaders said they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all who are mourning the loss of their loved ones .

creditor nations meet this week to discuss the matter . foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday in jakarta , indonesia , that the german government would consider providing more than just a suspension of debt payments for the country hardest hit by the underwater earthquake and tsunami on december 26 .
" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "

foreign relief workers have yet to be affected by the fighting but fischer did discuss the matter with president yudhoyono .
fischer said after the meeting he had the impression indonesia realized how necessary it was for the helpers to be able to work in a peaceful environment .

" when something happens again , people will rightfully ask , why we were n't diligent enough .

creditor nations meet this week to discuss the matter . foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday in jakarta , indonesia , that the german government would consider providing more than just a suspension of debt payments for the country hardest hit by the underwater earthquake and tsunami on december 26 .
" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "
on wednesday , the creditor nations of the paris club are meeting to consider a debt moratorium for sri lanka and indonesia .
for indonesia , a debt moratorium is of extreme importance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relief mission in indonesia continues unabated despite aftershock and helicopter mishap economic affairs minister aburizal bakrie said his country would like to freeze payments on $ 3.2 billion -lrb- € 2.46 billion -rrb- of debt until the year 2007 .
at that time , bakrie said , indonesia should be able to restart payments .
jakarta alone is $ 48 billion in debt .

at 5:00 am local time -lrb- 22:00 utc -rrb- , residents of banda aceh ran out onto the streets in panic after a powerful 6.2 aftershock struck the already badly destroyed city .
there were no immediate reports of casualties .
also , a us military helicopter crashed in a rice paddy during a relief mission in aceh province .
officials said no one died in the crash but all on board were taken to a hospital .
the us military at first halted all helicopter flights but then soon resumed them in a scaled-back operation .
there was no indication that the helicopter went down due to ground fire , but in the past few days , firefights have taken place between the indonesian army and the rebel group gam who is demanding an independent state in aceh .

the german government applauded the peace accord signed on sunday but the crisis in darfur is still cause for concern . in nairobi , kenya , on sunday thousands of jubilant sudanese , many of them refugees who live in the east african nation , witnessed the signing of a deal to end africa ’ s longest-running conflict .
sudan ’ s vice president ali osman taha and southern sudan people ’ s liberation movement / army -lrb- splm / a -rrb- leader john garang signed the historic accord which marks an end to the war between the central , islamist government in khartoum and the mainly animist and christian south .
the cornerstone of the agreement , one which garang said had changed sudan , is a six-year autonomy period for the south and an exemption from sharia law .
also , the vast oil reserves , found primarily in the south , will be divided evenly between the two sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's vice president ali osman taha -lrb- left -rrb- and spla chairman john garang -lrb- right -rrb- exchange the peace agreement documents at nyayo stadium nairobi , kenya led by garang , the splm / a rebelled in 1983 when the muslim-dominated north wanted to impose islamic law on the whole country .
since then , nearly two million people have died in the fighting and accompanying disease and famine .
germany hailed the accord as a first step to sudanese stability .
" the signature of the peace accord is only a first step , albeit a big one .
the international community must watch over and support the practical application of the accord , " said senior foreign office official kerstin müller , who visited sudan last year .
darfur crisis still unresolved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced sudanese from darfur are dependent on food aid from outside germany , like the rest of the international community , continues to be concerned with the continuing strife in the western sudan region of darfur .
since february 2003 , sudanese rebels have been battling with sudanese troops and their militia allies .
over 70,000 people have died and at least 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes .
müller warned that the humanitarian crisis in darfur remained dramatic and required the world 's political and humanitarian commitment .
germany , she added , would continue its aid program to the troubled area in 2005 .
in brussels , the european commission called the agreement a " quantum leap " for the region .
it hoped that the peace accord signed in nairobi would have a positive impact on the darfur conflict . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to send troops to sudan germany will send troops to sudan to support african union peacekeeping efforts in the war-torn region of darfur .

german experts have spoken : from fashion and leisure to cultural and political events , trend researchers make it their business to know what 's hot and what 's not in the year ahead . lest you think trend researchers only care about predicting which shade of lipstick will be a best-seller -lrb- for 2005 , think pink and red-orange , by the way -rrb- roman retzbach is quick to correct .
the head of the future institute in berlin said 70 percent of his work is aimed at politicians and influential leaders within the united nations and the european union . " trend research has gained more relevance in the post sept .
11 era , " retzbach said .
" before , politicians got trend reports and said , ' how nice ! ' and then tucked them away in their desks .
that 's changing .
today , the president of the united states has a future expert among his consultants .
trend experts are now important members of political teams . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , with chinese president hu jintao one of the big questions in 2004 , said retzbach , was whether turkey would join the eu .
he predicts that turkey 's candidacy will be successful , and adds that within 15 years , russia will also have joined the bloc .
indeed , russian president vladimir putin tops retzbach 's list of political leaders to watch in 2005 , along with chinese leader hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- . the cult of the individual trend forecasting has also become an indispensable part of the business world , as the marketing departments of major companies seek to better understand the consumer psyche , and in turn , increase sales .
german firms looking to strike it rich in 2005 would do well to note that , as in 2004 , the focus is on the individual . " germany has to catch up with the us here , " said peter wippermann , the founder of trend büro , a hamburg-based trend research company .
" there , for a longer time , customers have been the focus of attention .
in germany , we pay more attention to products , but that 's changing and companies are realizing they have to appeal to consumers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers line up outside the h & m store in frankfurt , germany for the lagerfeld collection and if there 's one thing that german individuals like , it 's getting a great deal .
that means discounters and the purveyors of " cheap chic , " such as clothing retailer hennes & mauritz -lrb- h & m -rrb- , can be expected to continue to do well in 2005 .
but retzbach said there 's an additional trend even these retailers should not ignore . " in society , lifestyle , and business , the key word is ' eventing , " ' he said .
" make something into an event , and people will come .
we saw this recently with electronics retailer media markt .
they put their prices down for one day , and people were willing to stand in line for two hours to pay for something . " discounting luxury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld , seen here with a model for his h & m collection , brought haute couture to the masses events that combine discounts and luxury are surefire winners , according to wippermann , who cited h & m 's recent venture with designer karl lagerfeld as a classic example .
lagerfeld 's limited edition " haute couture for the masses " sold out within hours at stores across europe , highlighting yet another consumer trend - " the importance of the moment , " as wippermann put it . " retailers are putting artificial time limits on the availability of products rather than saying , these are the products we have all the time , " he added . speaking of fashion , wippermann predicted that 2005 will see a return to stricter differentiation between the sexes , with women wearing the romantic , feminine styles of the 1950s , and men dressing either in classic suits , or sporty , athletic clothing . " fashion is really the last vestige for men and women to express their gender and sexuality , as in other realms , men and women have achieved more equality , " wippermann said . bye-bye big brother ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brad pitt 's star is predicted to rise even further in 2005 according to the future institute , among the other trends to watch out for in 2005 is the end of reality tv .
hard as it is to believe that we could tire of watching a group of talentless strangers cooped up in a container live out the minutiae of their daily lives , it seems the end is nigh for big brother & co . quality , scripted dramas are once again in demand .
on the big screen , count on seeing more of brad pitt and angelina jolie . and , in keeping with retzbach 's overall assessment that 2005 is the year of retro , two notable germans who will enjoy a comeback of sorts are physicist albert einstein and poet friedrich schiller : the two men died 50 and 200 years ago respectively . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lagerfeld causes cheap chic craze all hell broke loose when the limited edition karl lagerfeld for h & m collection hit selected stores in germany friday .
-lrb- nov.12 , 2004 -rrb- shopping with style and bucking the low-spender trend from " trend shopper " to " styler " , consumer sociologists are mapping the various types of german consumers , a boon to the country 's struggling retail industry .
-lrb- april 8 , 2004 -rrb- german reality shows in need of reality check reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants .

it bans them from smoking in public places including bars , restaurants , discotheques and offices . there have been two delays in applying the regulation , but now the die is cast : as of monday , private homes , the open air or special places reserved for smokers will be the only places to light up .
plainclothes police will patrol the country 's 240,000 eating and drinking establishments on the lookout for miscreants , press reports said . asian tsunamis apart , no subject has dominated conversation more among the nation 's large bar and cafe population . only 5 percent of italy 's 240,000 bars and restaurants have special rooms for smokers , according to fip , the country 's trade association .
some landlords have threatened to boycott the law , warning they will not play sheriff to customers . majority in favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still open to smokers nevertheless , a public opinion poll has shown that 83 percent of italians are in favor of the new ban . many smokers seemed resigned , especially with promised fines of € 275 -lrb- $ 360 -rrb- for customers caught smoking , and up to € 2,200 for offending landlords .
but opposition remained strong to the end in this land of dedicated subversives , extending even up to cabinet level . parliament is setting an example with a rigorous ban on its premises despite protest from die-hard smokers in government and on the benches . " i 've been smoking since age 18 - it 's my sacred right , " italian defense minister antonio martino said in an interview with corriere della sera newspaper .
" these restrictions are overdone . " a cartoon in the same newspaper showed a blindfolded man exhaling a last puff of smoke as he stands before a firing squad . " jan .
9 , 2005 , one last cigarette , " read the caption . protecting non-smokers the law was passed in 2002 and the government will accept no further delay in implementing the legislation . the rule was supposed to take effect on jan .
1 , but health minister girolamo sirchia granted a final stay of execution so as not to spoil new year 's eve celebrations and the religious feast of the epiphany on jan .
6 . sirchia said the law was designed to protect public health . " it 's not inspired by the idea of prohibition , " he said .
" it 's to protect against passive smoking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish pubs threw out ashtrays last march the move follows similiar bans imposed last year in ireland and norway , where smoking is barred in public places .
other countries , such as britain , portugal and sweden , have drafted plans to establish similar laws . the german government meanwhile has recently announced plans to ban smoking in schools and hospitals , but so far no attempts have been made to outlaw cigarettes in other public places as well . soft transition gianpaolo , a 54 year-old office worker , said his local bar in cinecitta , the rome movie studio district , had already banned smoking to get regulars used to the idea . " the landlord put up a sign saying ' vietato fumare ' -lrb- no smoking -rrb- , " he said .
" there 's no special room where you can smoke , but he allows smoking on outside terraces where there are ashtrays if customers ca n't do without a puff even for a moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly woman lights up a cigarette in a bar in downtown rome in front of an handwritten note reading in italian " please do n't smoke . "
gianpaolo said he is miffed because , although he can still buy cigarettes at his local bar , he ca n't light up there over his coffee and grappa . at angelo 's bar near the vatican museums , the landlord has a sign up saying : " you 're allowed to smoke on alternative days here .
today is no-smoking day . " " i 'm an inveterate smoker and i know it will be hard to find a bar or nice tearoom to have a cup with my friends , " said teresa .
" there are very few places with separate rooms for smokers . " fears of losing customers but she admitted : " basically i find the law ok .
it has been in force for a long time on trains , and that makes things better for everybody .
it used to be awful . " one problem will be discotheques , whose owners fear losing customers , mostly young smokers . bildunterschrift : who 's smoking here ?
meanwhile inside the vatican , catholic church officials dutifully try to respect italian regulations but with occasional lapses by smoking priests . after all , according to tradition this is where it all started in europe , when a 16th century french ambassador , jean nicot , presented the tobacco weed as a gift to the pope . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes for anti-smoking initiatives the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals .

" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "

the us military at first halted all helicopter flights but then soon resumed them in a scaled-back operation .
there was no indication that the helicopter went down due to ground fire , but in the past few days , firefights have taken place between the indonesian army and the rebel group gam who is demanding an independent state in aceh .
foreign relief workers have yet to be affected by the fighting but fischer did discuss the matter with president yudhoyono .
fischer said after the meeting he had the impression indonesia realized how necessary it was for the helpers to be able to work in a peaceful environment .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .
5 pledge € 500 million for relief aid .
schröder also called on the opposition to end the debate over the volume of the reconstruction aid as promised by the government .
he said conservatives had no reason to worry over how berlin would raise the € 500 million -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- it has pledged . " this year we ’ ve got a budget of € 251 billion .
if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .
so , we ’ re talking about a meager 0.04 percent a year , just to put things in perspective . " two conservative state premiers , edmund stoiber in bavaria and christian wulff in lower saxony have both called into question how germany will finance its aid pledge .
that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster . " i 've rarely seen - and you know i pay close attention to money - such bean counting as i have from mr. wulff and mr. stoiber regarding the flood catastrophe , " german finance minister hans eichel said according to the reuters news agency . at a memorial service in commemoration of the tsunami victims in berlin on sunday , state and church leaders said they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all who are mourning the loss of their loved ones .

how much more romance is there , then , in exploring the ocean .
how much more romance , even , in exploring the floor of the ocean itself .
over 95 % of the ocean 's floor is unexplored .
many people – maybe even you – have not even had the idea of digging in there .
the joides resolution is a ship on a mission , one of the first of its kind .
it drilled beneath the earth at the bottom of the ocean .
but the ship didn ’ t just scrape the surface .
it went as far as 420 meters deep into that earth , and found the remains of organisms as old as 35 million years .
and also living creatures , eating those leftovers .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .
5 pledge € 500 million for relief aid .
schröder also called on the opposition to end the debate over the volume of the reconstruction aid as promised by the government .
he said conservatives had no reason to worry over how berlin would raise the € 500 million -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- it has pledged . " this year we ’ ve got a budget of € 251 billion .
if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .
so , we ’ re talking about a meager 0.04 percent a year , just to put things in perspective . " two conservative state premiers , edmund stoiber in bavaria and christian wulff in lower saxony have both called into question how germany will finance its aid pledge .
that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster . " i 've rarely seen - and you know i pay close attention to money - such bean counting as i have from mr. wulff and mr. stoiber regarding the flood catastrophe , " german finance minister hans eichel said according to the reuters news agency . at a memorial service in commemoration of the tsunami victims in berlin on sunday , state and church leaders said they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all who are mourning the loss of their loved ones .
sixty germans are confirmed dead and some 700 are still unaccounted for .

germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .
however , germany ’ s central labor agency in nuremberg maintains that there are quite a number of experts among the country ’ s unemployed who would easily meet all the requirements for a reconstruction mission in south asia . debate over aid financing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joscka fischer , left , and chancellor schröder at a press conference on jan .
5 pledge € 500 million for relief aid .
schröder also called on the opposition to end the debate over the volume of the reconstruction aid as promised by the government .
he said conservatives had no reason to worry over how berlin would raise the € 500 million -lrb- $ 674 million -rrb- it has pledged . " this year we ’ ve got a budget of € 251 billion .
if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .
so , we ’ re talking about a meager 0.04 percent a year , just to put things in perspective . " two conservative state premiers , edmund stoiber in bavaria and christian wulff in lower saxony have both called into question how germany will finance its aid pledge .
that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster . " i 've rarely seen - and you know i pay close attention to money - such bean counting as i have from mr. wulff and mr. stoiber regarding the flood catastrophe , " german finance minister hans eichel said according to the reuters news agency . at a memorial service in commemoration of the tsunami victims in berlin on sunday , state and church leaders said they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all who are mourning the loss of their loved ones .
sixty germans are confirmed dead and some 700 are still unaccounted for .

creditor nations meet this week to discuss the matter . foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday in jakarta , indonesia , that the german government would consider providing more than just a suspension of debt payments for the country hardest hit by the underwater earthquake and tsunami on december 26 .
" from our political commitment , it is quite clear we are ready for a debt moratorium or to go further , if there is a need , " fischer told reporters after meeting with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono .
germany is not alone , fischer said , in the matter of a debt moratorium .
" as far as i understand , the united kingdom and others , including the united states are planning and thinking in the same way , so i think all options are open and should be discussed in a constructive and positive way in the paris club . "

officials said no one died in the crash but all on board were taken to a hospital .
the us military at first halted all helicopter flights but then soon resumed them in a scaled-back operation .
there was no indication that the helicopter went down due to ground fire , but in the past few days , firefights have taken place between the indonesian army and the rebel group gam who is demanding an independent state in aceh .
foreign relief workers have yet to be affected by the fighting but fischer did discuss the matter with president yudhoyono .
fischer said after the meeting he had the impression indonesia realized how necessary it was for the helpers to be able to work in a peaceful environment .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .

that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster .

chancellor schröder has dismissed plans to send unemployed germans to tsunami-stricken areas to help with reconstruction as unrealistic and criticized those questioning berlin 's ability to provide € 500 million in aid . responding to proposals by opposition politicians that german jobless could aid in rebuilding those regions hit by the south asian tsunami disaster , chancellor gerhard schröder said in a television interview that such ideas were unserious . he pointed out that helpers should not only be technical experts , but also need to have a decent command of english or the local languages . " i think the emphasis should be on using the experts from the countries affected by the tsunamis , " schröder told german public television on sunday .
" and we ’ re talking about skilled and highly motivated personnel , there ’ s no lack of expertise and manpower that would have to be compensated from outside on a massive scale . " opposition liberal democrat deputy chief rainer brüderle had earlier proposed sending unemployed germans to the disaster area to help rebuild there .
he said many people currently on the dole would be willing to go there and face greater chances of employment upon their return back home . brüderle ’ s suggestion was backed by christian democrat peter harry carstensen in the northern state of schleswig-holstein .
he too believes that many of germany ’ s over four million unemployed could be of use in the countries hit by the tsunamis , calling on the government to promote special short-term working contracts with jobless volunteers . various aid organizations have dismissed the opposition ’ s proposal as being utterly unfeasible .

if we were to provide the € 500 million in reconstruction aid in 2005 , then this would amount to 0.2 percent of the budget , " said schröder .
" but i ’ ve made it clear from the start that we ’ re going to allocate the money in question over a period of up to five years .
so , we ’ re talking about a meager 0.04 percent a year , just to put things in perspective . " two conservative state premiers , edmund stoiber in bavaria and christian wulff in lower saxony have both called into question how germany will finance its aid pledge .
that in turn has led some social democrats to label them as being hardhearted to those affected by the disaster . " i 've rarely seen - and you know i pay close attention to money - such bean counting as i have from mr. wulff and mr. stoiber regarding the flood catastrophe , " german finance minister hans eichel said according to the reuters news agency . at a memorial service in commemoration of the tsunami victims in berlin on sunday , state and church leaders said they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with all who are mourning the loss of their loved ones .

it bans them from smoking in public places including bars , restaurants , discotheques and offices . there have been two delays in applying the regulation , but now the die is cast : as of monday , private homes , the open air or special places reserved for smokers will be the only places to light up .
plainclothes police will patrol the country 's 240,000 eating and drinking establishments on the lookout for miscreants , press reports said . asian tsunamis apart , no subject has dominated conversation more among the nation 's large bar and cafe population . only 5 percent of italy 's 240,000 bars and restaurants have special rooms for smokers , according to fip , the country 's trade association .
some landlords have threatened to boycott the law , warning they will not play sheriff to customers . majority in favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still open to smokers nevertheless , a public opinion poll has shown that 83 percent of italians are in favor of the new ban . many smokers seemed resigned , especially with promised fines of € 275 -lrb- $ 360 -rrb- for customers caught smoking , and up to € 2,200 for offending landlords .
but opposition remained strong to the end in this land of dedicated subversives , extending even up to cabinet level . parliament is setting an example with a rigorous ban on its premises despite protest from die-hard smokers in government and on the benches . " i 've been smoking since age 18 - it 's my sacred right , " italian defense minister antonio martino said in an interview with corriere della sera newspaper .
" these restrictions are overdone . " a cartoon in the same newspaper showed a blindfolded man exhaling a last puff of smoke as he stands before a firing squad . " jan .
9 , 2005 , one last cigarette , " read the caption . protecting non-smokers the law was passed in 2002 and the government will accept no further delay in implementing the legislation . the rule was supposed to take effect on jan .
1 , but health minister girolamo sirchia granted a final stay of execution so as not to spoil new year 's eve celebrations and the religious feast of the epiphany on jan .
6 . sirchia said the law was designed to protect public health . " it 's not inspired by the idea of prohibition , " he said .
" it 's to protect against passive smoking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish pubs threw out ashtrays last march the move follows similiar bans imposed last year in ireland and norway , where smoking is barred in public places .
other countries , such as britain , portugal and sweden , have drafted plans to establish similar laws . the german government meanwhile has recently announced plans to ban smoking in schools and hospitals , but so far no attempts have been made to outlaw cigarettes in other public places as well . soft transition gianpaolo , a 54 year-old office worker , said his local bar in cinecitta , the rome movie studio district , had already banned smoking to get regulars used to the idea . " the landlord put up a sign saying ' vietato fumare ' -lrb- no smoking -rrb- , " he said .
" there 's no special room where you can smoke , but he allows smoking on outside terraces where there are ashtrays if customers ca n't do without a puff even for a moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly woman lights up a cigarette in a bar in downtown rome in front of an handwritten note reading in italian " please do n't smoke . "
gianpaolo said he is miffed because , although he can still buy cigarettes at his local bar , he ca n't light up there over his coffee and grappa . at angelo 's bar near the vatican museums , the landlord has a sign up saying : " you 're allowed to smoke on alternative days here .
today is no-smoking day . " " i 'm an inveterate smoker and i know it will be hard to find a bar or nice tearoom to have a cup with my friends , " said teresa .
" there are very few places with separate rooms for smokers . " fears of losing customers but she admitted : " basically i find the law ok .
it has been in force for a long time on trains , and that makes things better for everybody .
it used to be awful . " one problem will be discotheques , whose owners fear losing customers , mostly young smokers . bildunterschrift : who 's smoking here ?
meanwhile inside the vatican , catholic church officials dutifully try to respect italian regulations but with occasional lapses by smoking priests . after all , according to tradition this is where it all started in europe , when a 16th century french ambassador , jean nicot , presented the tobacco weed as a gift to the pope . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes for anti-smoking initiatives the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals .

it bans them from smoking in public places including bars , restaurants , discotheques and offices . there have been two delays in applying the regulation , but now the die is cast : as of monday , private homes , the open air or special places reserved for smokers will be the only places to light up .
plainclothes police will patrol the country 's 240,000 eating and drinking establishments on the lookout for miscreants , press reports said . asian tsunamis apart , no subject has dominated conversation more among the nation 's large bar and cafe population . only 5 percent of italy 's 240,000 bars and restaurants have special rooms for smokers , according to fip , the country 's trade association .
some landlords have threatened to boycott the law , warning they will not play sheriff to customers . majority in favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still open to smokers nevertheless , a public opinion poll has shown that 83 percent of italians are in favor of the new ban . many smokers seemed resigned , especially with promised fines of € 275 -lrb- $ 360 -rrb- for customers caught smoking , and up to € 2,200 for offending landlords .
but opposition remained strong to the end in this land of dedicated subversives , extending even up to cabinet level . parliament is setting an example with a rigorous ban on its premises despite protest from die-hard smokers in government and on the benches . " i 've been smoking since age 18 - it 's my sacred right , " italian defense minister antonio martino said in an interview with corriere della sera newspaper .
" these restrictions are overdone . " a cartoon in the same newspaper showed a blindfolded man exhaling a last puff of smoke as he stands before a firing squad . " jan .
9 , 2005 , one last cigarette , " read the caption . protecting non-smokers the law was passed in 2002 and the government will accept no further delay in implementing the legislation . the rule was supposed to take effect on jan .
1 , but health minister girolamo sirchia granted a final stay of execution so as not to spoil new year 's eve celebrations and the religious feast of the epiphany on jan .

" it 's to protect against passive smoking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish pubs threw out ashtrays last march the move follows similiar bans imposed last year in ireland and norway , where smoking is barred in public places .
other countries , such as britain , portugal and sweden , have drafted plans to establish similar laws . the german government meanwhile has recently announced plans to ban smoking in schools and hospitals , but so far no attempts have been made to outlaw cigarettes in other public places as well . soft transition gianpaolo , a 54 year-old office worker , said his local bar in cinecitta , the rome movie studio district , had already banned smoking to get regulars used to the idea . " the landlord put up a sign saying ' vietato fumare ' -lrb- no smoking -rrb- , " he said .
" there 's no special room where you can smoke , but he allows smoking on outside terraces where there are ashtrays if customers ca n't do without a puff even for a moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly woman lights up a cigarette in a bar in downtown rome in front of an handwritten note reading in italian " please do n't smoke . "
gianpaolo said he is miffed because , although he can still buy cigarettes at his local bar , he ca n't light up there over his coffee and grappa . at angelo 's bar near the vatican museums , the landlord has a sign up saying : " you 're allowed to smoke on alternative days here .
today is no-smoking day . " " i 'm an inveterate smoker and i know it will be hard to find a bar or nice tearoom to have a cup with my friends , " said teresa .
" there are very few places with separate rooms for smokers . " fears of losing customers but she admitted : " basically i find the law ok .
it has been in force for a long time on trains , and that makes things better for everybody .
it used to be awful . " one problem will be discotheques , whose owners fear losing customers , mostly young smokers . bildunterschrift : who 's smoking here ?
meanwhile inside the vatican , catholic church officials dutifully try to respect italian regulations but with occasional lapses by smoking priests . after all , according to tradition this is where it all started in europe , when a 16th century french ambassador , jean nicot , presented the tobacco weed as a gift to the pope . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes for anti-smoking initiatives the german government is going on a new offensive against smoking , asking the nation 's restaurants to provide more space for non-smokers and pushing for a ban on lighting up in hospitals .

a jubilant abbas proclaimed victory soon after exit polls showed that he had secured around two-thirds of the votes cast , dedicating the result to his late predecessor and long-time boss yasser arafat . " i will work to put an end to the suffering of the palestinian people for they are a people who deserve our esteem , our respect and our loyalty , " abbas told hundreds of his supporters in the palestinian authority 's political capital ramallah . abbas obtained 62.32 percent of votes cast , streets ahead of his nearest rival mustafa barghuti who won 19.8 percent , the figures by the central elections commission said on monday . the election result was hailed around the world as offering a chance for peace in the troubled middle east .
both the united states and the european union pledged they would help make the most of the opportunity presented by abbas ' rise to the palestinian presidency . " you can be sure that the european communities will help you in every respect - politically , economically , with security or whatever you need , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana after meeting with the palestinian president-elect monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana " we have a new opportunity now , an avenue of optimism , an avenue to work together to make the dream of so many people into a reality , " he said . solana , who is on a week-long tour of the region , had talks ahead of the election with jordan 's king abdullah ii and foreign minister hani mulki on how europe and jordan can help the palestinians . washington to boost peace efforts us president george w. bush said he was " heartened " by strong turnout in palestinian elections on sunday and promised to bolster peace efforts . " this is a historic day for the palestinian people and for the people of the middle east , " he said . bush urged israel to help improve the humanitarian and economic situation in the west bank and gaza and said the arab states must take " concrete steps with all parties to create a regional environment conducive to peace , lend financial support to the palestinian people , and refuse to assist or harbor terrorists . " abbas is considered moderate and pragmatic in washington , which had supported him during his brief term as prime minister in 2003 .
but us officials have emphasized that abbas will be judged by the progress of reforms that the us administration considers essential : controlling palestinian security forces and ending attacks by radical palestinian groups . london peace conference british prime minister tony blair congratulated abbas on his win and said a conference to be hosted in london in march could help the palestinian leader tackle the daunting tasks ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man casts his vote in the election on sunday " mr abbas faces considerable challenges in building the institutions needed to underpin a viable palestinian state .
we will support him as he does so , including by hosting the london meeting in early march , " blair said in a statement . the london conference , set for march 1-2 , will focus on palestinian security , political and economic reforms in hopes that the moribund middle east peace process can be revived . incoming us secretary of state condoleezza rice is to attend the event , along with delegates of the european union , russia , the united nations and other countries , but israel says it will stay away . israel optimistic but israel officials still said they hoped the election of abbas would usher in a new era of peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's anti-smoking battle eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking sweden bans smoking britain to impose sweeping smoking ban banning smoke at work in europe europe -pipe- 10.01.2005 smoking ban begins in italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 'll have to stay outside italy 's 14 million smokers are bracing for a new anti-smoking law which comes into force monday .
it bans them from smoking in public places including bars , restaurants , discotheques and offices . there have been two delays in applying the regulation , but now the die is cast : as of monday , private homes , the open air or special places reserved for smokers will be the only places to light up .
plainclothes police will patrol the country 's 240,000 eating and drinking establishments on the lookout for miscreants , press reports said . asian tsunamis apart , no subject has dominated conversation more among the nation 's large bar and cafe population . only 5 percent of italy 's 240,000 bars and restaurants have special rooms for smokers , according to fip , the country 's trade association .
some landlords have threatened to boycott the law , warning they will not play sheriff to customers . majority in favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still open to smokers nevertheless , a public opinion poll has shown that 83 percent of italians are in favor of the new ban . many smokers seemed resigned , especially with promised fines of € 275 -lrb- $ 360 -rrb- for customers caught smoking , and up to € 2,200 for offending landlords .
but opposition remained strong to the end in this land of dedicated subversives , extending even up to cabinet level . parliament is setting an example with a rigorous ban on its premises despite protest from die-hard smokers in government and on the benches . " i 've been smoking since age 18 - it 's my sacred right , " italian defense minister antonio martino said in an interview with corriere della sera newspaper .
" these restrictions are overdone . " a cartoon in the same newspaper showed a blindfolded man exhaling a last puff of smoke as he stands before a firing squad . " jan .
9 , 2005 , one last cigarette , " read the caption . protecting non-smokers the law was passed in 2002 and the government will accept no further delay in implementing the legislation . the rule was supposed to take effect on jan .
1 , but health minister girolamo sirchia granted a final stay of execution so as not to spoil new year 's eve celebrations and the religious feast of the epiphany on jan .
6 . sirchia said the law was designed to protect public health . " it 's not inspired by the idea of prohibition , " he said .
" it 's to protect against passive smoking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish pubs threw out ashtrays last march the move follows similiar bans imposed last year in ireland and norway , where smoking is barred in public places .
other countries , such as britain , portugal and sweden , have drafted plans to establish similar laws . the german government meanwhile has recently announced plans to ban smoking in schools and hospitals , but so far no attempts have been made to outlaw cigarettes in other public places as well . soft transition gianpaolo , a 54 year-old office worker , said his local bar in cinecitta , the rome movie studio district , had already banned smoking to get regulars used to the idea . " the landlord put up a sign saying ' vietato fumare ' -lrb- no smoking -rrb- , " he said .
" there 's no special room where you can smoke , but he allows smoking on outside terraces where there are ashtrays if customers ca n't do without a puff even for a moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly woman lights up a cigarette in a bar in downtown rome in front of an handwritten note reading in italian " please do n't smoke . "
gianpaolo said he is miffed because , although he can still buy cigarettes at his local bar , he ca n't light up there over his coffee and grappa . at angelo 's bar near the vatican museums , the landlord has a sign up saying : " you 're allowed to smoke on alternative days here .
today is no-smoking day . " " i 'm an inveterate smoker and i know it will be hard to find a bar or nice tearoom to have a cup with my friends , " said teresa .
" there are very few places with separate rooms for smokers . " fears of losing customers but she admitted : " basically i find the law ok .

it bans them from smoking in public places including bars , restaurants , discotheques and offices . there have been two delays in applying the regulation , but now the die is cast : as of monday , private homes , the open air or special places reserved for smokers will be the only places to light up .
plainclothes police will patrol the country 's 240,000 eating and drinking establishments on the lookout for miscreants , press reports said . asian tsunamis apart , no subject has dominated conversation more among the nation 's large bar and cafe population . only 5 percent of italy 's 240,000 bars and restaurants have special rooms for smokers , according to fip , the country 's trade association .
some landlords have threatened to boycott the law , warning they will not play sheriff to customers . majority in favor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still open to smokers nevertheless , a public opinion poll has shown that 83 percent of italians are in favor of the new ban . many smokers seemed resigned , especially with promised fines of € 275 -lrb- $ 360 -rrb- for customers caught smoking , and up to € 2,200 for offending landlords .
but opposition remained strong to the end in this land of dedicated subversives , extending even up to cabinet level . parliament is setting an example with a rigorous ban on its premises despite protest from die-hard smokers in government and on the benches . " i 've been smoking since age 18 - it 's my sacred right , " italian defense minister antonio martino said in an interview with corriere della sera newspaper .

other countries , such as britain , portugal and sweden , have drafted plans to establish similar laws . the german government meanwhile has recently announced plans to ban smoking in schools and hospitals , but so far no attempts have been made to outlaw cigarettes in other public places as well . soft transition gianpaolo , a 54 year-old office worker , said his local bar in cinecitta , the rome movie studio district , had already banned smoking to get regulars used to the idea . " the landlord put up a sign saying ' vietato fumare ' -lrb- no smoking -rrb- , " he said .
" there 's no special room where you can smoke , but he allows smoking on outside terraces where there are ashtrays if customers ca n't do without a puff even for a moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an elderly woman lights up a cigarette in a bar in downtown rome in front of an handwritten note reading in italian " please do n't smoke . "
gianpaolo said he is miffed because , although he can still buy cigarettes at his local bar , he ca n't light up there over his coffee and grappa . at angelo 's bar near the vatican museums , the landlord has a sign up saying : " you 're allowed to smoke on alternative days here .
today is no-smoking day . " " i 'm an inveterate smoker and i know it will be hard to find a bar or nice tearoom to have a cup with my friends , " said teresa .
" there are very few places with separate rooms for smokers . " fears of losing customers but she admitted : " basically i find the law ok .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.01.2005 german visions of tomorrow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year , we 'll dress like proper ladies and gentlemen , experts say wondering what 's in store in 2005 ?
german experts have spoken : from fashion and leisure to cultural and political events , trend researchers make it their business to know what 's hot and what 's not in the year ahead . lest you think trend researchers only care about predicting which shade of lipstick will be a best-seller -lrb- for 2005 , think pink and red-orange , by the way -rrb- roman retzbach is quick to correct .
the head of the future institute in berlin said 70 percent of his work is aimed at politicians and influential leaders within the united nations and the european union . " trend research has gained more relevance in the post sept .
11 era , " retzbach said .
" before , politicians got trend reports and said , ' how nice ! ' and then tucked them away in their desks .
that 's changing .
today , the president of the united states has a future expert among his consultants .
trend experts are now important members of political teams . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , with chinese president hu jintao one of the big questions in 2004 , said retzbach , was whether turkey would join the eu .
he predicts that turkey 's candidacy will be successful , and adds that within 15 years , russia will also have joined the bloc .
indeed , russian president vladimir putin tops retzbach 's list of political leaders to watch in 2005 , along with chinese leader hu jintao -lrb- photo -rrb- . the cult of the individual trend forecasting has also become an indispensable part of the business world , as the marketing departments of major companies seek to better understand the consumer psyche , and in turn , increase sales .
german firms looking to strike it rich in 2005 would do well to note that , as in 2004 , the focus is on the individual . " germany has to catch up with the us here , " said peter wippermann , the founder of trend büro , a hamburg-based trend research company .
" there , for a longer time , customers have been the focus of attention .
in germany , we pay more attention to products , but that 's changing and companies are realizing they have to appeal to consumers . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers line up outside the h & m store in frankfurt , germany for the lagerfeld collection and if there 's one thing that german individuals like , it 's getting a great deal .
that means discounters and the purveyors of " cheap chic , " such as clothing retailer hennes & mauritz -lrb- h & m -rrb- , can be expected to continue to do well in 2005 .
but retzbach said there 's an additional trend even these retailers should not ignore . " in society , lifestyle , and business , the key word is ' eventing , " ' he said .

the chancellor would not comment on the reports , but insisted he would not be " diverted or distracted " from tackling the challenges faced by the country .
his only " motivation " was to ensure labour was re-elected , he insisted .
mr blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for gordon brown as old news .
according to a new book , brown 's britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston , mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004 .
my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were robert peston in an interview with bbc one 's breakfast with frost , mr blair said : " i 've dealt with this six months ago .
i said then you do n't do deals over jobs like this - you do n't .
" what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country . "
' enormously damaging ' in a separate interview with bbc political editor andrew marr , mr brown said : " it 's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government .
" i think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that i have .
" that is my purpose in politics , and that is what every day i seek to do .
and i am not going to be diverted or distracted , nor is tony blair , by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip .
" the only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country . "
mr brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do .
when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you .
all sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims tony blair but mr peston said the pair had " mutual animosity and contempt " for each other and that mr blair had decided in november 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters ' trust because of the iraq war .
he then changed his mind in june 2004 , following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him , according to the book .
andrew marr said : " this is enormously damaging .
gordon brown knows it as well as tony blair .
" i think the relationship is genuinely , privately , very poor indeed .
things are very difficult . "
he added : " lots of ministers believe tony blair will attempt to move gordon brown out of the treasury after the election .
" that depends on whether there 's still a labour government and their majority . "
no denial senior mps are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of labour backbenchers on monday .
it is damaging to the labour party and the country donald , aberdeen have your say health secretary john reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging labour 's re-election chances and would not be easily forgiven .
fresh speculation of a rift recently followed mr blair and mr brown 's separate responses to the asian tsunami .
these rumours were fuelled by mr blair 's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new " marshall plan " for africa .
there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other 's response to the disaster .
but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a " load of nonsense " .
tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of " squabbling like schoolboys " .
liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was " getting in the way of good government " .

the chancellor would not comment on the reports , but insisted he would not be " diverted or distracted " from tackling the challenges faced by the country .
his only " motivation " was to ensure labour was re-elected , he insisted .
mr blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for gordon brown as old news .
according to a new book , brown 's britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston , mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004 . "
my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were " robert peston in an interview with bbc one 's breakfast with frost , mr blair said : " i 've dealt with this six months ago .
i said then you do n't do deals over jobs like this - you do n't .
" what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country . "
' enormously damaging ' in a separate interview with bbc political editor andrew marr , mr brown said : " it 's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government .
" i think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that i have .
" that is my purpose in politics , and that is what every day i seek to do .
and i am not going to be diverted or distracted , nor is tony blair , by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip .
" the only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country . "
mr brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do . "
