gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families business -pipe- 04.04.2005 work-life balance gets boost in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining work and family - a difficult balance in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .
" companies are losing out if women decide to leave their jobs in order to raise a family - that 's incredibly expensive , and makes no sense .

" every single company can play a part in making germany a more family-friendly country , and in the meantime , industry has realized what an important factor this is for the future . " beate werhahn is optimistic that after what she calls a " value loss " in german society , the pendulum is starting to swing back towards more family values , even in the workplace .
she freely admits that having her baby was the best move she ever made in her career , because it 's made her a happier person . the happiness factor is not to be underestimated , according to gisela erler of familienservice .

but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .

those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .

" beate werhahn is optimistic that after what she calls a " value loss " in german society , the pendulum is starting to swing back towards more family values , even in the workplace .
she freely admits that having her baby was the best move she ever made in her career , because it 's made her a happier person . the happiness factor is not to be underestimated , according to gisela erler of familienservice .

everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .
the result means stuttgart are four points ahead of bremen and strong favorites to seal the final champions league spot for next season . reigning champions bremen have refused to wave the white flag in their title defense but their slim hopes vanished with the 2-1 home reverse against vfb . silvio meissner put stuttgart ahead in the 48th minute but bremen equalized through ivan klasnic four minutes later . a frantic scramble followed in the closing stages with bremen 's french defender valerien ismael dismissed on 84 minutes for two bookable offences and stuttgart struck the killer blow three minutes later through christian tiffert . bremen were nine points clear at the top of the table last term as they powered to the title but this season just reaching the champions league would suffice . berlin wave goodbye to champions league hertha berlin were another team eyeing europe 's premier competition but their dream ended on sunday following a 2-1 defeat at borussia dortmund which ended a four-game unbeaten streak .
it also meant that berlin have not won in dortmund for 33 years . the capital club are seven points behind stuttgart and a uefa cup berth now looks to be the target .
borussia dortmund climbed two places on the back of the win and are now in ninth , raising hopes of a possible uefa cup spot of their own after a wretched season .
" after we got ahead we should have made it 3-0 or 4-0 , " said dortmund trainer bert van marwijk .
" the win was deserved . " dortmund play for pride after disaster season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon put dortmund ahead against berlin .
dortmund led 2-0 at halftime with goals from brazilian ewerthon and ebi smolarek before germany defender arne friedrich halved the deficit after 62 minutes . hertha goalkeeper christian fielder stopped shots from smolarek and ewerthon , while dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was also busy in front of 76,100 spectators at the westfalen stadium . it seems like we lack the belief that we can win in dortmund , " said hertha trainer falko götz .
" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .

the german music industry once more gave the ex-take that singer the prize for the best male in the pop / rock category of the 2005 echo awards , held in berlin on saturday night . the british star was picking up the award for the fourth year running but , unlike previous years , robbie was not in town personally to accept the accolade , even though the event 's organizer 's had tried to tempt him to germany by kitting out the vip lounge with a playstation console , a favorite of the singer . williams beat the likes of phil collins , george michael , seal and usher for the echo , which is seen as the world 's most important music industry prize after the grammys and brits . in the best international pop / rock female artist , american singer anastacia triumphed over contemporaries such as nelly furtado , norah jones , avril lavigne and katie melua . anastacia scoops best female award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anastacia " it 's been a dream year for me , " said anastacia , 31 , a major star in germany where she sold more than a million albums in 2004 .
the singer won her first echo four years ago and has since had many ups and downs , including successful treatment for breast cancer . anastacia and fellow pop diva mariah carey were among the 14 international and german acts performing during the nationally broadcasted ceremony . her award and live appearance also gave anastacia the opportunity to dismiss claims made by a german rival that she and carey hated each other and wanted promises their paths would n't cross in berlin .
" mariah rocks - get over it , people , " anastacia told the crowd after picking up her gong . although katie melua missed out to anastacia in the international pop / rock female artist category , the georgia-born resident of belfast did pick up the echo for the international newcomer of the year . young german artists made a strong showing this year with german singer annett louisan winning the award for the best national artist while best national group went to the musical collective söhne mannheims .
german band silbermond picked up the award for best newcomer . eminem considers shortening trophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rap singer eminem robbie williams was n't the only star unable to make it to berlin to collect an echo .
one of the most anticipated appearances was due to be rap superstar eminem , who won the echo award for best international hip hop artist , but the man also known as slim shady could n't make it , preferring to deliver a dry acceptance speech via a videotaped message from the united states . " thanks for this , " he said , staring at the sleek one-meter high echo trophy .
" but it 's kind of long and i think i 'm going to have to cut off the top so it fits on my shelf . " nominations for the awards were based on sales in germany , the world 's fourth largest music market behind the united states , japan and britain with annual sales of 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- .
a jury then picked the winners in 26 categories . even though the german industry has seen sales tumble by more than 40 percent since 1997 due to internet piracy that has hit the industry worldwide , the surging popularity of german recording artists are taking a bigger share of the home market . german albums took a record 30 percent share in 2004 and the rising demand helped prop up the home market , where overall sales fell just 3.6 percent after steeper drops in prior years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national and international stars shine in berlin not long ago the world would n't have blinked when the german music industry handed out its echo awards .

the german music industry once more gave the ex-take that singer the prize for the best male in the pop / rock category of the 2005 echo awards , held in berlin on saturday night . the british star was picking up the award for the fourth year running but , unlike previous years , robbie was not in town personally to accept the accolade , even though the event 's organizer 's had tried to tempt him to germany by kitting out the vip lounge with a playstation console , a favorite of the singer . williams beat the likes of phil collins , george michael , seal and usher for the echo , which is seen as the world 's most important music industry prize after the grammys and brits . in the best international pop / rock female artist , american singer anastacia triumphed over contemporaries such as nelly furtado , norah jones , avril lavigne and katie melua . anastacia scoops best female award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anastacia " it 's been a dream year for me , " said anastacia , 31 , a major star in germany where she sold more than a million albums in 2004 .

in france , a left-wing catholic group said he " was completely out of touch with changes in values and in philosophical and scientific conceptions of life . " chinese authorities , meanwhile , arrested an elderly bishop from china 's underground catholic church , apparently for failing to toe the official line on religious issues , a us-based rights group said monday . in a frosty message , its foreign ministry said : " we hope that the vatican under the new pope will create conditions conducive to the improvement of relations with china .

here we have a real global phenomenon .
john paul ii was the pope of the globalization era . " moscow 's izvestia daily said : " the death of john paul ii is the end of the era of great post-war personalities .
then , history took place not just as a conflict of systems but also as a struggle between great personalities .
then , reagan 's naive greatness relied on the pope 's measured greatness , was bolstered by solzhenitsyn 's sparkling greatness , found an echo in sakharov 's disheveled greatness , in havel 's refined greatness and in walesa 's featherbrained greatness , multiplied itself with thatcher 's dosage - and already dreary soviet czarism fell apart . " poland 's gazeta wyborcza remarked : " we lived in the era of john paul ii - for that is how the last quarter-century will be dubbed - the time of the pope who changed the catholic church , the world and , finally , every one of us . … his demands were high .
that 's why he often caused controversy .
but the words of controversy never changed the respect and admiration for st. peter 's successor in rome .
he personally experienced both of the 20th century 's worst demons - the totalitarianism of the nazis and of the communists .
the shadows of auschwitz and kolyma continually accompanied his teachings … we are sad today .
the poles ' greatest authority will never return .
and we thank fate that this extraordinary representative of christ , who did so much good , appeared in our life . " parisian daily liberation commented that : " karol wojtyla was at the same time an iron pope and a ' pope star . '
he switched back and forth between engaged conservatism in the real world and the reactionary defense of dogma . … this dogmatism prevented him from increasing the number of clerics through ordaining women into the priesthood or allowing priests to marry .
it also held him captive in the image of a prelate bent only on restoration and not renovation .
in the midst of the return to religiosity , from which the catholic church alone did n't really seem to profit , this immobility will possibly remain his main sin in the memory of his own congregation . " switzerland 's neue zürcher zeitung wrote : " all those catholics were fooled who believed that as pope wojtyla would declare the bishops ' synod the church 's ' parliament ' and himself its highest executive organ .
he did n't allow the primacy of the bishop of rome to be shaken , not from modern inner-catholic powers , nor from the other christian communities .
john paul ii leaves his successor a difficult legacy .
the whole world will measure the new pope against his predecessor .
but his charisma defies any comparison . " munich 's abendzeitung commented : " his unflinching rejection of every form of birth control was consistent .
but it was counterproductive in the fight against poverty and overpopulation .
and his condemnation of condoms at a time when aids had long been known to be a global threat did n't put a brake on the disease 's spread .
if you add to that his adversity to internal church reforms , from celibacy to ordaining women , the image gets tarnished .
however , exactly these contradictions constitute the fascination with this man .
the same people who turned away in irritation when he claimed the catholic church was superior to other religious denominations took pleasure in his decisive partisanship against the war in iraq .

gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families business -pipe- 04.04.2005 work-life balance gets boost in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining work and family - a difficult balance in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .
" companies are losing out if women decide to leave their jobs in order to raise a family - that 's incredibly expensive , and makes no sense .
that 's why companies are starting to do something about it themselves . " government incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for family affairs renate schmidt on the cover of her book " sos family - without children , we 're starting to look old " to spur on the family-friendly company movement , the ministry for family affairs has launched a competition to name the nation 's top employers for parents .
a total of 366 firms entered the competition , though that number has since been whittled down to 35 companies of various sizes , and from various sectors .
the winners will be announced in may . " i 'm pleased about the high number of applicants and the wealth of ideas with which german companies hope to make themselves more family-friendly , " said renate schmidt , minister for family affairs .
" every single company can play a part in making germany a more family-friendly country , and in the meantime , industry has realized what an important factor this is for the future . " beate werhahn is optimistic that after what she calls a " value loss " in german society , the pendulum is starting to swing back towards more family values , even in the workplace .
she freely admits that having her baby was the best move she ever made in her career , because it 's made her a happier person . the happiness factor is not to be underestimated , according to gisela erler of familienservice . " experienced bosses realize that employees who lead balanced lives with families are in the end happier and more productive than the workaholic , " she said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany child-friendlier the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .

gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families business -pipe- 04.04.2005 work-life balance gets boost in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining work and family - a difficult balance in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .
" companies are losing out if women decide to leave their jobs in order to raise a family - that 's incredibly expensive , and makes no sense .
that 's why companies are starting to do something about it themselves .

the winners will be announced in may . " i 'm pleased about the high number of applicants and the wealth of ideas with which german companies hope to make themselves more family-friendly , " said renate schmidt , minister for family affairs .
" every single company can play a part in making germany a more family-friendly country , and in the meantime , industry has realized what an important factor this is for the future . " beate werhahn is optimistic that after what she calls a " value loss " in german society , the pendulum is starting to swing back towards more family values , even in the workplace .
she freely admits that having her baby was the best move she ever made in her career , because it 's made her a happier person . the happiness factor is not to be underestimated , according to gisela erler of familienservice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 04.04.2005 bundesliga hopefuls scrap for cup places großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's title chances are slim but timo hildebrand still eyes europe bayern munich and schalke 04 will continue to fight it out for the title after wins this weekend put them clear of the pack .
everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .
the result means stuttgart are four points ahead of bremen and strong favorites to seal the final champions league spot for next season . reigning champions bremen have refused to wave the white flag in their title defense but their slim hopes vanished with the 2-1 home reverse against vfb . silvio meissner put stuttgart ahead in the 48th minute but bremen equalized through ivan klasnic four minutes later . a frantic scramble followed in the closing stages with bremen 's french defender valerien ismael dismissed on 84 minutes for two bookable offences and stuttgart struck the killer blow three minutes later through christian tiffert . bremen were nine points clear at the top of the table last term as they powered to the title but this season just reaching the champions league would suffice . berlin wave goodbye to champions league hertha berlin were another team eyeing europe 's premier competition but their dream ended on sunday following a 2-1 defeat at borussia dortmund which ended a four-game unbeaten streak .
it also meant that berlin have not won in dortmund for 33 years . the capital club are seven points behind stuttgart and a uefa cup berth now looks to be the target .
borussia dortmund climbed two places on the back of the win and are now in ninth , raising hopes of a possible uefa cup spot of their own after a wretched season .
" after we got ahead we should have made it 3-0 or 4-0 , " said dortmund trainer bert van marwijk .
" the win was deserved . " dortmund play for pride after disaster season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon put dortmund ahead against berlin .
dortmund led 2-0 at halftime with goals from brazilian ewerthon and ebi smolarek before germany defender arne friedrich halved the deficit after 62 minutes . hertha goalkeeper christian fielder stopped shots from smolarek and ewerthon , while dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was also busy in front of 76,100 spectators at the westfalen stadium . it seems like we lack the belief that we can win in dortmund , " said hertha trainer falko götz .
" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .
" that 's out of line , " goetz said .
" there 's going to be a price to pay for that . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de title hopes for bremen now zero reigning champs werder bremen had lost to schalke and bayern munich in the second leg .

the german music industry once more gave the ex-take that singer the prize for the best male in the pop / rock category of the 2005 echo awards , held in berlin on saturday night . the british star was picking up the award for the fourth year running but , unlike previous years , robbie was not in town personally to accept the accolade , even though the event 's organizer 's had tried to tempt him to germany by kitting out the vip lounge with a playstation console , a favorite of the singer . williams beat the likes of phil collins , george michael , seal and usher for the echo , which is seen as the world 's most important music industry prize after the grammys and brits . in the best international pop / rock female artist , american singer anastacia triumphed over contemporaries such as nelly furtado , norah jones , avril lavigne and katie melua . anastacia scoops best female award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anastacia " it 's been a dream year for me , " said anastacia , 31 , a major star in germany where she sold more than a million albums in 2004 .
the singer won her first echo four years ago and has since had many ups and downs , including successful treatment for breast cancer . anastacia and fellow pop diva mariah carey were among the 14 international and german acts performing during the nationally broadcasted ceremony . her award and live appearance also gave anastacia the opportunity to dismiss claims made by a german rival that she and carey hated each other and wanted promises their paths would n't cross in berlin .
" mariah rocks - get over it , people , " anastacia told the crowd after picking up her gong . although katie melua missed out to anastacia in the international pop / rock female artist category , the georgia-born resident of belfast did pick up the echo for the international newcomer of the year . young german artists made a strong showing this year with german singer annett louisan winning the award for the best national artist while best national group went to the musical collective söhne mannheims .
german band silbermond picked up the award for best newcomer . eminem considers shortening trophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rap singer eminem robbie williams was n't the only star unable to make it to berlin to collect an echo .
one of the most anticipated appearances was due to be rap superstar eminem , who won the echo award for best international hip hop artist , but the man also known as slim shady could n't make it , preferring to deliver a dry acceptance speech via a videotaped message from the united states . " thanks for this , " he said , staring at the sleek one-meter high echo trophy .
" but it 's kind of long and i think i 'm going to have to cut off the top so it fits on my shelf . " nominations for the awards were based on sales in germany , the world 's fourth largest music market behind the united states , japan and britain with annual sales of 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- .
a jury then picked the winners in 26 categories . even though the german industry has seen sales tumble by more than 40 percent since 1997 due to internet piracy that has hit the industry worldwide , the surging popularity of german recording artists are taking a bigger share of the home market . german albums took a record 30 percent share in 2004 and the rising demand helped prop up the home market , where overall sales fell just 3.6 percent after steeper drops in prior years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national and international stars shine in berlin not long ago the world would n't have blinked when the german music industry handed out its echo awards .

everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .
the result means stuttgart are four points ahead of bremen and strong favorites to seal the final champions league spot for next season . reigning champions bremen have refused to wave the white flag in their title defense but their slim hopes vanished with the 2-1 home reverse against vfb . silvio meissner put stuttgart ahead in the 48th minute but bremen equalized through ivan klasnic four minutes later . a frantic scramble followed in the closing stages with bremen 's french defender valerien ismael dismissed on 84 minutes for two bookable offences and stuttgart struck the killer blow three minutes later through christian tiffert . bremen were nine points clear at the top of the table last term as they powered to the title but this season just reaching the champions league would suffice . berlin wave goodbye to champions league hertha berlin were another team eyeing europe 's premier competition but their dream ended on sunday following a 2-1 defeat at borussia dortmund which ended a four-game unbeaten streak .
it also meant that berlin have not won in dortmund for 33 years . the capital club are seven points behind stuttgart and a uefa cup berth now looks to be the target .
borussia dortmund climbed two places on the back of the win and are now in ninth , raising hopes of a possible uefa cup spot of their own after a wretched season .
" after we got ahead we should have made it 3-0 or 4-0 , " said dortmund trainer bert van marwijk .
" the win was deserved . " dortmund play for pride after disaster season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon put dortmund ahead against berlin .
dortmund led 2-0 at halftime with goals from brazilian ewerthon and ebi smolarek before germany defender arne friedrich halved the deficit after 62 minutes . hertha goalkeeper christian fielder stopped shots from smolarek and ewerthon , while dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was also busy in front of 76,100 spectators at the westfalen stadium . it seems like we lack the belief that we can win in dortmund , " said hertha trainer falko götz .
" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .
" that 's out of line , " goetz said .

with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .
the result means stuttgart are four points ahead of bremen and strong favorites to seal the final champions league spot for next season . reigning champions bremen have refused to wave the white flag in their title defense but their slim hopes vanished with the 2-1 home reverse against vfb . silvio meissner put stuttgart ahead in the 48th minute but bremen equalized through ivan klasnic four minutes later . a frantic scramble followed in the closing stages with bremen 's french defender valerien ismael dismissed on 84 minutes for two bookable offences and stuttgart struck the killer blow three minutes later through christian tiffert . bremen were nine points clear at the top of the table last term as they powered to the title but this season just reaching the champions league would suffice . berlin wave goodbye to champions league hertha berlin were another team eyeing europe 's premier competition but their dream ended on sunday following a 2-1 defeat at borussia dortmund which ended a four-game unbeaten streak .
it also meant that berlin have not won in dortmund for 33 years . the capital club are seven points behind stuttgart and a uefa cup berth now looks to be the target .
borussia dortmund climbed two places on the back of the win and are now in ninth , raising hopes of a possible uefa cup spot of their own after a wretched season .
" after we got ahead we should have made it 3-0 or 4-0 , " said dortmund trainer bert van marwijk .
" the win was deserved . " dortmund play for pride after disaster season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon put dortmund ahead against berlin .
dortmund led 2-0 at halftime with goals from brazilian ewerthon and ebi smolarek before germany defender arne friedrich halved the deficit after 62 minutes . hertha goalkeeper christian fielder stopped shots from smolarek and ewerthon , while dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was also busy in front of 76,100 spectators at the westfalen stadium . it seems like we lack the belief that we can win in dortmund , " said hertha trainer falko götz .
" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .
" that 's out of line , " goetz said .
" there 's going to be a price to pay for that . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de title hopes for bremen now zero reigning champs werder bremen had lost to schalke and bayern munich in the second leg .

gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families business -pipe- 04.04.2005 work-life balance gets boost in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining work and family - a difficult balance in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .
" companies are losing out if women decide to leave their jobs in order to raise a family - that 's incredibly expensive , and makes no sense .
that 's why companies are starting to do something about it themselves . " government incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for family affairs renate schmidt on the cover of her book " sos family - without children , we 're starting to look old " to spur on the family-friendly company movement , the ministry for family affairs has launched a competition to name the nation 's top employers for parents .
a total of 366 firms entered the competition , though that number has since been whittled down to 35 companies of various sizes , and from various sectors .
the winners will be announced in may . " i 'm pleased about the high number of applicants and the wealth of ideas with which german companies hope to make themselves more family-friendly , " said renate schmidt , minister for family affairs .
" every single company can play a part in making germany a more family-friendly country , and in the meantime , industry has realized what an important factor this is for the future . " beate werhahn is optimistic that after what she calls a " value loss " in german society , the pendulum is starting to swing back towards more family values , even in the workplace .
she freely admits that having her baby was the best move she ever made in her career , because it 's made her a happier person . the happiness factor is not to be underestimated , according to gisela erler of familienservice . " experienced bosses realize that employees who lead balanced lives with families are in the end happier and more productive than the workaholic , " she said . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany child-friendlier the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .

the german music industry once more gave the ex-take that singer the prize for the best male in the pop / rock category of the 2005 echo awards , held in berlin on saturday night . the british star was picking up the award for the fourth year running but , unlike previous years , robbie was not in town personally to accept the accolade , even though the event 's organizer 's had tried to tempt him to germany by kitting out the vip lounge with a playstation console , a favorite of the singer . williams beat the likes of phil collins , george michael , seal and usher for the echo , which is seen as the world 's most important music industry prize after the grammys and brits . in the best international pop / rock female artist , american singer anastacia triumphed over contemporaries such as nelly furtado , norah jones , avril lavigne and katie melua . anastacia scoops best female award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anastacia " it 's been a dream year for me , " said anastacia , 31 , a major star in germany where she sold more than a million albums in 2004 .
the singer won her first echo four years ago and has since had many ups and downs , including successful treatment for breast cancer . anastacia and fellow pop diva mariah carey were among the 14 international and german acts performing during the nationally broadcasted ceremony . her award and live appearance also gave anastacia the opportunity to dismiss claims made by a german rival that she and carey hated each other and wanted promises their paths would n't cross in berlin .
" mariah rocks - get over it , people , " anastacia told the crowd after picking up her gong . although katie melua missed out to anastacia in the international pop / rock female artist category , the georgia-born resident of belfast did pick up the echo for the international newcomer of the year . young german artists made a strong showing this year with german singer annett louisan winning the award for the best national artist while best national group went to the musical collective söhne mannheims .
german band silbermond picked up the award for best newcomer . eminem considers shortening trophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rap singer eminem robbie williams was n't the only star unable to make it to berlin to collect an echo .
one of the most anticipated appearances was due to be rap superstar eminem , who won the echo award for best international hip hop artist , but the man also known as slim shady could n't make it , preferring to deliver a dry acceptance speech via a videotaped message from the united states . " thanks for this , " he said , staring at the sleek one-meter high echo trophy .
" but it 's kind of long and i think i 'm going to have to cut off the top so it fits on my shelf . " nominations for the awards were based on sales in germany , the world 's fourth largest music market behind the united states , japan and britain with annual sales of 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- .
a jury then picked the winners in 26 categories . even though the german industry has seen sales tumble by more than 40 percent since 1997 due to internet piracy that has hit the industry worldwide , the surging popularity of german recording artists are taking a bigger share of the home market . german albums took a record 30 percent share in 2004 and the rising demand helped prop up the home market , where overall sales fell just 3.6 percent after steeper drops in prior years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national and international stars shine in berlin not long ago the world would n't have blinked when the german music industry handed out its echo awards .

the singer won her first echo four years ago and has since had many ups and downs , including successful treatment for breast cancer . anastacia and fellow pop diva mariah carey were among the 14 international and german acts performing during the nationally broadcasted ceremony . her award and live appearance also gave anastacia the opportunity to dismiss claims made by a german rival that she and carey hated each other and wanted promises their paths would n't cross in berlin .
" mariah rocks - get over it , people , " anastacia told the crowd after picking up her gong . although katie melua missed out to anastacia in the international pop / rock female artist category , the georgia-born resident of belfast did pick up the echo for the international newcomer of the year . young german artists made a strong showing this year with german singer annett louisan winning the award for the best national artist while best national group went to the musical collective söhne mannheims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 04.04.2005 bundesliga hopefuls scrap for cup places großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's title chances are slim but timo hildebrand still eyes europe bayern munich and schalke 04 will continue to fight it out for the title after wins this weekend put them clear of the pack .
everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .

everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .

" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .

every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .
" companies are losing out if women decide to leave their jobs in order to raise a family - that 's incredibly expensive , and makes no sense .
that 's why companies are starting to do something about it themselves .

the german music industry once more gave the ex-take that singer the prize for the best male in the pop / rock category of the 2005 echo awards , held in berlin on saturday night . the british star was picking up the award for the fourth year running but , unlike previous years , robbie was not in town personally to accept the accolade , even though the event 's organizer 's had tried to tempt him to germany by kitting out the vip lounge with a playstation console , a favorite of the singer . williams beat the likes of phil collins , george michael , seal and usher for the echo , which is seen as the world 's most important music industry prize after the grammys and brits . in the best international pop / rock female artist , american singer anastacia triumphed over contemporaries such as nelly furtado , norah jones , avril lavigne and katie melua . anastacia scoops best female award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anastacia " it 's been a dream year for me , " said anastacia , 31 , a major star in germany where she sold more than a million albums in 2004 .
the singer won her first echo four years ago and has since had many ups and downs , including successful treatment for breast cancer . anastacia and fellow pop diva mariah carey were among the 14 international and german acts performing during the nationally broadcasted ceremony . her award and live appearance also gave anastacia the opportunity to dismiss claims made by a german rival that she and carey hated each other and wanted promises their paths would n't cross in berlin .
" mariah rocks - get over it , people , " anastacia told the crowd after picking up her gong . although katie melua missed out to anastacia in the international pop / rock female artist category , the georgia-born resident of belfast did pick up the echo for the international newcomer of the year . young german artists made a strong showing this year with german singer annett louisan winning the award for the best national artist while best national group went to the musical collective söhne mannheims .

a jury then picked the winners in 26 categories . even though the german industry has seen sales tumble by more than 40 percent since 1997 due to internet piracy that has hit the industry worldwide , the surging popularity of german recording artists are taking a bigger share of the home market . german albums took a record 30 percent share in 2004 and the rising demand helped prop up the home market , where overall sales fell just 3.6 percent after steeper drops in prior years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national and international stars shine in berlin not long ago the world would n't have blinked when the german music industry handed out its echo awards .

everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .

the german music industry once more gave the ex-take that singer the prize for the best male in the pop / rock category of the 2005 echo awards , held in berlin on saturday night . the british star was picking up the award for the fourth year running but , unlike previous years , robbie was not in town personally to accept the accolade , even though the event 's organizer 's had tried to tempt him to germany by kitting out the vip lounge with a playstation console , a favorite of the singer . williams beat the likes of phil collins , george michael , seal and usher for the echo , which is seen as the world 's most important music industry prize after the grammys and brits . in the best international pop / rock female artist , american singer anastacia triumphed over contemporaries such as nelly furtado , norah jones , avril lavigne and katie melua . anastacia scoops best female award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anastacia " it 's been a dream year for me , " said anastacia , 31 , a major star in germany where she sold more than a million albums in 2004 .
the singer won her first echo four years ago and has since had many ups and downs , including successful treatment for breast cancer . anastacia and fellow pop diva mariah carey were among the 14 international and german acts performing during the nationally broadcasted ceremony . her award and live appearance also gave anastacia the opportunity to dismiss claims made by a german rival that she and carey hated each other and wanted promises their paths would n't cross in berlin .
" mariah rocks - get over it , people , " anastacia told the crowd after picking up her gong . although katie melua missed out to anastacia in the international pop / rock female artist category , the georgia-born resident of belfast did pick up the echo for the international newcomer of the year . young german artists made a strong showing this year with german singer annett louisan winning the award for the best national artist while best national group went to the musical collective söhne mannheims .
german band silbermond picked up the award for best newcomer . eminem considers shortening trophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rap singer eminem robbie williams was n't the only star unable to make it to berlin to collect an echo .
one of the most anticipated appearances was due to be rap superstar eminem , who won the echo award for best international hip hop artist , but the man also known as slim shady could n't make it , preferring to deliver a dry acceptance speech via a videotaped message from the united states . " thanks for this , " he said , staring at the sleek one-meter high echo trophy .
" but it 's kind of long and i think i 'm going to have to cut off the top so it fits on my shelf . " nominations for the awards were based on sales in germany , the world 's fourth largest music market behind the united states , japan and britain with annual sales of 1.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- .
a jury then picked the winners in 26 categories . even though the german industry has seen sales tumble by more than 40 percent since 1997 due to internet piracy that has hit the industry worldwide , the surging popularity of german recording artists are taking a bigger share of the home market . german albums took a record 30 percent share in 2004 and the rising demand helped prop up the home market , where overall sales fell just 3.6 percent after steeper drops in prior years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national and international stars shine in berlin not long ago the world would n't have blinked when the german music industry handed out its echo awards .

everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .
the result means stuttgart are four points ahead of bremen and strong favorites to seal the final champions league spot for next season . reigning champions bremen have refused to wave the white flag in their title defense but their slim hopes vanished with the 2-1 home reverse against vfb . silvio meissner put stuttgart ahead in the 48th minute but bremen equalized through ivan klasnic four minutes later . a frantic scramble followed in the closing stages with bremen 's french defender valerien ismael dismissed on 84 minutes for two bookable offences and stuttgart struck the killer blow three minutes later through christian tiffert . bremen were nine points clear at the top of the table last term as they powered to the title but this season just reaching the champions league would suffice . berlin wave goodbye to champions league hertha berlin were another team eyeing europe 's premier competition but their dream ended on sunday following a 2-1 defeat at borussia dortmund which ended a four-game unbeaten streak .
it also meant that berlin have not won in dortmund for 33 years . the capital club are seven points behind stuttgart and a uefa cup berth now looks to be the target .
borussia dortmund climbed two places on the back of the win and are now in ninth , raising hopes of a possible uefa cup spot of their own after a wretched season .
" after we got ahead we should have made it 3-0 or 4-0 , " said dortmund trainer bert van marwijk .
" the win was deserved . " dortmund play for pride after disaster season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon put dortmund ahead against berlin .
dortmund led 2-0 at halftime with goals from brazilian ewerthon and ebi smolarek before germany defender arne friedrich halved the deficit after 62 minutes . hertha goalkeeper christian fielder stopped shots from smolarek and ewerthon , while dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was also busy in front of 76,100 spectators at the westfalen stadium . it seems like we lack the belief that we can win in dortmund , " said hertha trainer falko götz .
" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .

everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .
the result means stuttgart are four points ahead of bremen and strong favorites to seal the final champions league spot for next season . reigning champions bremen have refused to wave the white flag in their title defense but their slim hopes vanished with the 2-1 home reverse against vfb . silvio meissner put stuttgart ahead in the 48th minute but bremen equalized through ivan klasnic four minutes later . a frantic scramble followed in the closing stages with bremen 's french defender valerien ismael dismissed on 84 minutes for two bookable offences and stuttgart struck the killer blow three minutes later through christian tiffert . bremen were nine points clear at the top of the table last term as they powered to the title but this season just reaching the champions league would suffice . berlin wave goodbye to champions league hertha berlin were another team eyeing europe 's premier competition but their dream ended on sunday following a 2-1 defeat at borussia dortmund which ended a four-game unbeaten streak .
it also meant that berlin have not won in dortmund for 33 years . the capital club are seven points behind stuttgart and a uefa cup berth now looks to be the target .
borussia dortmund climbed two places on the back of the win and are now in ninth , raising hopes of a possible uefa cup spot of their own after a wretched season .
" after we got ahead we should have made it 3-0 or 4-0 , " said dortmund trainer bert van marwijk .
" the win was deserved . " dortmund play for pride after disaster season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon put dortmund ahead against berlin .
dortmund led 2-0 at halftime with goals from brazilian ewerthon and ebi smolarek before germany defender arne friedrich halved the deficit after 62 minutes . hertha goalkeeper christian fielder stopped shots from smolarek and ewerthon , while dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was also busy in front of 76,100 spectators at the westfalen stadium . it seems like we lack the belief that we can win in dortmund , " said hertha trainer falko götz .
" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .

gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families business -pipe- 04.04.2005 work-life balance gets boost in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining work and family - a difficult balance in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .

gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families business -pipe- 04.04.2005 work-life balance gets boost in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining work and family - a difficult balance in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .

gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families business -pipe- 04.04.2005 work-life balance gets boost in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining work and family - a difficult balance in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .
" companies are losing out if women decide to leave their jobs in order to raise a family - that 's incredibly expensive , and makes no sense .
that 's why companies are starting to do something about it themselves . " government incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for family affairs renate schmidt on the cover of her book " sos family - without children , we 're starting to look old " to spur on the family-friendly company movement , the ministry for family affairs has launched a competition to name the nation 's top employers for parents .
a total of 366 firms entered the competition , though that number has since been whittled down to 35 companies of various sizes , and from various sectors .
the winners will be announced in may . " i 'm pleased about the high number of applicants and the wealth of ideas with which german companies hope to make themselves more family-friendly , " said renate schmidt , minister for family affairs .
" every single company can play a part in making germany a more family-friendly country , and in the meantime , industry has realized what an important factor this is for the future . " beate werhahn is optimistic that after what she calls a " value loss " in german society , the pendulum is starting to swing back towards more family values , even in the workplace .
she freely admits that having her baby was the best move she ever made in her career , because it 's made her a happier person . the happiness factor is not to be underestimated , according to gisela erler of familienservice .

everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .
the result means stuttgart are four points ahead of bremen and strong favorites to seal the final champions league spot for next season . reigning champions bremen have refused to wave the white flag in their title defense but their slim hopes vanished with the 2-1 home reverse against vfb . silvio meissner put stuttgart ahead in the 48th minute but bremen equalized through ivan klasnic four minutes later . a frantic scramble followed in the closing stages with bremen 's french defender valerien ismael dismissed on 84 minutes for two bookable offences and stuttgart struck the killer blow three minutes later through christian tiffert . bremen were nine points clear at the top of the table last term as they powered to the title but this season just reaching the champions league would suffice . berlin wave goodbye to champions league hertha berlin were another team eyeing europe 's premier competition but their dream ended on sunday following a 2-1 defeat at borussia dortmund which ended a four-game unbeaten streak .
it also meant that berlin have not won in dortmund for 33 years . the capital club are seven points behind stuttgart and a uefa cup berth now looks to be the target .
borussia dortmund climbed two places on the back of the win and are now in ninth , raising hopes of a possible uefa cup spot of their own after a wretched season .
" after we got ahead we should have made it 3-0 or 4-0 , " said dortmund trainer bert van marwijk .
" the win was deserved . " dortmund play for pride after disaster season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon put dortmund ahead against berlin .
dortmund led 2-0 at halftime with goals from brazilian ewerthon and ebi smolarek before germany defender arne friedrich halved the deficit after 62 minutes . hertha goalkeeper christian fielder stopped shots from smolarek and ewerthon , while dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was also busy in front of 76,100 spectators at the westfalen stadium . it seems like we lack the belief that we can win in dortmund , " said hertha trainer falko götz .
" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .
" that 's out of line , " goetz said .
" there 's going to be a price to pay for that . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de title hopes for bremen now zero reigning champs werder bremen had lost to schalke and bayern munich in the second leg .

the singer won her first echo four years ago and has since had many ups and downs , including successful treatment for breast cancer . anastacia and fellow pop diva mariah carey were among the 14 international and german acts performing during the nationally broadcasted ceremony . her award and live appearance also gave anastacia the opportunity to dismiss claims made by a german rival that she and carey hated each other and wanted promises their paths would n't cross in berlin .
" mariah rocks - get over it , people , " anastacia told the crowd after picking up her gong . although katie melua missed out to anastacia in the international pop / rock female artist category , the georgia-born resident of belfast did pick up the echo for the international newcomer of the year . young german artists made a strong showing this year with german singer annett louisan winning the award for the best national artist while best national group went to the musical collective söhne mannheims .

a jury then picked the winners in 26 categories . even though the german industry has seen sales tumble by more than 40 percent since 1997 due to internet piracy that has hit the industry worldwide , the surging popularity of german recording artists are taking a bigger share of the home market . german albums took a record 30 percent share in 2004 and the rising demand helped prop up the home market , where overall sales fell just 3.6 percent after steeper drops in prior years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de national and international stars shine in berlin not long ago the world would n't have blinked when the german music industry handed out its echo awards .

the german music industry once more gave the ex-take that singer the prize for the best male in the pop / rock category of the 2005 echo awards , held in berlin on saturday night . the british star was picking up the award for the fourth year running but , unlike previous years , robbie was not in town personally to accept the accolade , even though the event 's organizer 's had tried to tempt him to germany by kitting out the vip lounge with a playstation console , a favorite of the singer . williams beat the likes of phil collins , george michael , seal and usher for the echo , which is seen as the world 's most important music industry prize after the grammys and brits . in the best international pop / rock female artist , american singer anastacia triumphed over contemporaries such as nelly furtado , norah jones , avril lavigne and katie melua . anastacia scoops best female award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anastacia " it 's been a dream year for me , " said anastacia , 31 , a major star in germany where she sold more than a million albums in 2004 .
the singer won her first echo four years ago and has since had many ups and downs , including successful treatment for breast cancer . anastacia and fellow pop diva mariah carey were among the 14 international and german acts performing during the nationally broadcasted ceremony . her award and live appearance also gave anastacia the opportunity to dismiss claims made by a german rival that she and carey hated each other and wanted promises their paths would n't cross in berlin .
" mariah rocks - get over it , people , " anastacia told the crowd after picking up her gong . although katie melua missed out to anastacia in the international pop / rock female artist category , the georgia-born resident of belfast did pick up the echo for the international newcomer of the year . young german artists made a strong showing this year with german singer annett louisan winning the award for the best national artist while best national group went to the musical collective söhne mannheims .

the german music industry once more gave the ex-take that singer the prize for the best male in the pop / rock category of the 2005 echo awards , held in berlin on saturday night . the british star was picking up the award for the fourth year running but , unlike previous years , robbie was not in town personally to accept the accolade , even though the event 's organizer 's had tried to tempt him to germany by kitting out the vip lounge with a playstation console , a favorite of the singer . williams beat the likes of phil collins , george michael , seal and usher for the echo , which is seen as the world 's most important music industry prize after the grammys and brits . in the best international pop / rock female artist , american singer anastacia triumphed over contemporaries such as nelly furtado , norah jones , avril lavigne and katie melua . anastacia scoops best female award bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anastacia " it 's been a dream year for me , " said anastacia , 31 , a major star in germany where she sold more than a million albums in 2004 .
the singer won her first echo four years ago and has since had many ups and downs , including successful treatment for breast cancer . anastacia and fellow pop diva mariah carey were among the 14 international and german acts performing during the nationally broadcasted ceremony . her award and live appearance also gave anastacia the opportunity to dismiss claims made by a german rival that she and carey hated each other and wanted promises their paths would n't cross in berlin .
" mariah rocks - get over it , people , " anastacia told the crowd after picking up her gong . although katie melua missed out to anastacia in the international pop / rock female artist category , the georgia-born resident of belfast did pick up the echo for the international newcomer of the year . young german artists made a strong showing this year with german singer annett louisan winning the award for the best national artist while best national group went to the musical collective söhne mannheims .
german band silbermond picked up the award for best newcomer . eminem considers shortening trophy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rap singer eminem robbie williams was n't the only star unable to make it to berlin to collect an echo .
one of the most anticipated appearances was due to be rap superstar eminem , who won the echo award for best international hip hop artist , but the man also known as slim shady could n't make it , preferring to deliver a dry acceptance speech via a videotaped message from the united states . " thanks for this , " he said , staring at the sleek one-meter high echo trophy .
" but it 's kind of long and i think i 'm going to have to cut off the top so it fits on my shelf .

everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .
the result means stuttgart are four points ahead of bremen and strong favorites to seal the final champions league spot for next season . reigning champions bremen have refused to wave the white flag in their title defense but their slim hopes vanished with the 2-1 home reverse against vfb . silvio meissner put stuttgart ahead in the 48th minute but bremen equalized through ivan klasnic four minutes later . a frantic scramble followed in the closing stages with bremen 's french defender valerien ismael dismissed on 84 minutes for two bookable offences and stuttgart struck the killer blow three minutes later through christian tiffert . bremen were nine points clear at the top of the table last term as they powered to the title but this season just reaching the champions league would suffice . berlin wave goodbye to champions league hertha berlin were another team eyeing europe 's premier competition but their dream ended on sunday following a 2-1 defeat at borussia dortmund which ended a four-game unbeaten streak .
it also meant that berlin have not won in dortmund for 33 years . the capital club are seven points behind stuttgart and a uefa cup berth now looks to be the target .
borussia dortmund climbed two places on the back of the win and are now in ninth , raising hopes of a possible uefa cup spot of their own after a wretched season .
" after we got ahead we should have made it 3-0 or 4-0 , " said dortmund trainer bert van marwijk .
" the win was deserved . " dortmund play for pride after disaster season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon put dortmund ahead against berlin .
dortmund led 2-0 at halftime with goals from brazilian ewerthon and ebi smolarek before germany defender arne friedrich halved the deficit after 62 minutes . hertha goalkeeper christian fielder stopped shots from smolarek and ewerthon , while dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was also busy in front of 76,100 spectators at the westfalen stadium . it seems like we lack the belief that we can win in dortmund , " said hertha trainer falko götz .
" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .
" that 's out of line , " goetz said .
" there 's going to be a price to pay for that . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de title hopes for bremen now zero reigning champs werder bremen had lost to schalke and bayern munich in the second leg .

everyone else will have to settle for battling for european slots . bayern munich warmed up for wednesday 's champions league showdown with chelsea with a convincing 3-0 win over vfl wolfsburg on saturday as they retained their position at the top of the bundesliga . bayern manager felix magath claimed international matches had left his selection of cosmopolitan troops drained but there were no signs of fatigue as munich took the game to wolfsburg .
with 29 minutes gone torsten frings darted down the right flank and found german international bastian schweinsteiger with a cross to the back post .
schweinsteiger showed great poise to trap the ball before producing an accomplished side-footed volley . " we do not need to look at anyone else as we are top , " said schweinsteiger .
" our fate is in our own hands and i firmly believe we will win the title . " luck favors the brave as bayern go for big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern remain on course in their title challenge with a comfortable away win against wolfsburg .
with the seconds ticking down to the half-time interval bayern doubled their lead although there was a touch of fortune involved . roy makaay drilled his shot at wolves goalkeeper simon jentzsch but the ball ricocheted off wolves defender kevin hofland and rolled back into the net . wolves hit the post in the 54th minute and bayern rubbed salt in the wounds by scoring sixty seconds later with the impressive frings glancing a header in .
" we were compact at the back and did what was necessary up front , " explained magath .
" this was an important step towards the championship . " while another league win cheered magath the coach was dismayed by an injury to claudio pizarro that forces the peruvian international to miss wednesday 's trip to chelsea .
dutch international makaay is also a doubt after sustaining a thigh injury . schalke 04 stay clipping at bayern 's heels following a 4-1 home triumph over fc nuremberg and lie second on goal difference . bit-player hanke becomes star attraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mike hanke , being congratulated by team mates , sealed the win for schalke .
danish international striker ebbe sand was forced off after just seven minutes due to injury and german under-21 international mike hanke came on in his place .
it proved a blessing in disguise as hanke produced a great leap to direct a header home in the 24th minute . in the 36th minute brazilian ailton then fed hanke and the marksman made no mistake to notch his second goal .
schalke recently confirmed their interest in signing stuttgart 's german international kevin kuranyi but hanke feels they are well-equipped in attack .
" schalke do not need a kevin kuranyi when they have mike hanke , " said the man himself . ailton scored four minutes later as schalke went into cruise control and compatriot lincoln netted on 74 minutes to cap a fine afternoon .
schalke may be level on points with bayern but have four tough games coming up against stuttgart , sv hamburg , hertha berlin and bayer leverkusen in a run that could make or break their championship dream . stuttgart kill off bremen 's defense of title bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : champions resigned to abdication , bremen struggled against stuttgart .
third-placed vfb stuttgart continue to be the jinx side for champions werder bremen recording a 2-1 victory at the weserstadion .
the result means stuttgart are four points ahead of bremen and strong favorites to seal the final champions league spot for next season . reigning champions bremen have refused to wave the white flag in their title defense but their slim hopes vanished with the 2-1 home reverse against vfb . silvio meissner put stuttgart ahead in the 48th minute but bremen equalized through ivan klasnic four minutes later . a frantic scramble followed in the closing stages with bremen 's french defender valerien ismael dismissed on 84 minutes for two bookable offences and stuttgart struck the killer blow three minutes later through christian tiffert . bremen were nine points clear at the top of the table last term as they powered to the title but this season just reaching the champions league would suffice . berlin wave goodbye to champions league hertha berlin were another team eyeing europe 's premier competition but their dream ended on sunday following a 2-1 defeat at borussia dortmund which ended a four-game unbeaten streak .
it also meant that berlin have not won in dortmund for 33 years . the capital club are seven points behind stuttgart and a uefa cup berth now looks to be the target .
borussia dortmund climbed two places on the back of the win and are now in ninth , raising hopes of a possible uefa cup spot of their own after a wretched season .
" after we got ahead we should have made it 3-0 or 4-0 , " said dortmund trainer bert van marwijk .
" the win was deserved . " dortmund play for pride after disaster season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon put dortmund ahead against berlin .
dortmund led 2-0 at halftime with goals from brazilian ewerthon and ebi smolarek before germany defender arne friedrich halved the deficit after 62 minutes . hertha goalkeeper christian fielder stopped shots from smolarek and ewerthon , while dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was also busy in front of 76,100 spectators at the westfalen stadium . it seems like we lack the belief that we can win in dortmund , " said hertha trainer falko götz .
" we made two stupid mistakes and got behind 2-0 . "
götz said he was annoyed about a shoving match between friedrich and midfield team mate marcelinho at halftime .
" that 's out of line , " goetz said .
" there 's going to be a price to pay for that . " dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de title hopes for bremen now zero reigning champs werder bremen had lost to schalke and bayern munich in the second leg .

gerd 's family policy gets down to business encouraging germans to have more kids the dumbing down of germany study : men in germany are scared to start families business -pipe- 04.04.2005 work-life balance gets boost in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining work and family - a difficult balance in germany in germany , where kids are seen as career killers , over 40 percent of highly qualified women choose to remain childless .
but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .
" companies are losing out if women decide to leave their jobs in order to raise a family - that 's incredibly expensive , and makes no sense .
that 's why companies are starting to do something about it themselves .

" every single company can play a part in making germany a more family-friendly country , and in the meantime , industry has realized what an important factor this is for the future . " beate werhahn is optimistic that after what she calls a " value loss " in german society , the pendulum is starting to swing back towards more family values , even in the workplace .
she freely admits that having her baby was the best move she ever made in her career , because it 's made her a happier person . the happiness factor is not to be underestimated , according to gisela erler of familienservice .

the procession is expected to begin at 4 p.m.
cet and the public will be allowed into the basilica an hour later and for three days and nights . st. peter 's or poland ? there was still no official confirmation on where the pope will be buried , whether in st. peter 's , as tradition dictates , or in his native poland . but italy 's corriere della sera said the pope had chosen to be buried in the crypt underneath the basilica and news agencies reported that cardinals had set friday as the date for the funeral . the daily also quoted cardinal franciszek macharski , the archbishop of krakow , denying rumors that the pope 's heart was to be buried in the city where he was bishop before becoming pontiff . polish pilgrims holding vigil in st. peter 's square said they nonetheless hoped that he would be buried in a polish flag . thursday likely funeral date cardinals were to meet at 10:30 a.m.

a crucifix , crooked in his left elbow , lay alongside his body .

in france , a left-wing catholic group said he " was completely out of touch with changes in values and in philosophical and scientific conceptions of life . " chinese authorities , meanwhile , arrested an elderly bishop from china 's underground catholic church , apparently for failing to toe the official line on religious issues , a us-based rights group said monday . in a frosty message , its foreign ministry said : " we hope that the vatican under the new pope will create conditions conducive to the improvement of relations with china .

but a competition to find the nation 's most family-friendly companies is hoping to change that . beate werhahn has her own personal wake-up service in two-year-old daughter , charlotte .
every morning at 6 a.m. , the human resources manager for the berlin branch of audit , tax and advisory services firm kpmg starts her day with a bit of playtime , then breakfast , before dropping charlotte at kindergarten . at work , werhahn has been given the flexibility to arrange her day as it suits her .
some days , she leaves the office as early as 3 p.m. to pick up her daughter .
but she also has the security of knowing that if she has to work late , the kindergarten 's business-friendly hours mean charlotte is in good hands until 6:30 p.m. werhahn found the kindergarten through familienservice - an agency kpmg has on contract to help those employees with children find arrangements to balance their work and family commitments . " for me , it was helpful because i only had two months to get myself organized between the time i was offered my job and starting work , " werhahn said .
" normally , to get a kindergarten place , you have to fill in an application nine months or a year in advance , so it was very helpful to have familienservice acting as an agent for me . " thanks to her company 's support , werhahn is successfully combining job and family .
but not many highly-educated working women in germany can say the same .
around 40 percent of female college graduates in this country forgo having children altogether - just one aspect contributing to germany 's worrying demographic shift as the population both shrinks and ages . societal pressures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students the education system is partly to blame , as by the time women have finished their college degrees and gathered a few years of work experience , they often only have a small window of five to eight years in which to decide whether to have kids . but societal values are just as much a factor .
frequently , working women are reluctant to step off the career ladder , for fear of having to start at the bottom again should they decide to return to work .
those that do return are often plagued by guilt - the result of a persistent notion in german culture that working mothers are bad mothers . " we 're the world leader when it comes to not having kids , " said gisela erler , the head of familienservice .
" lots of countries have low birth rates , but that so many people go without kids at all , and that so many of them are highly qualified - that 's something you only see here in germany . " erler sees familienservice as a " gap filler " for companies which recognize the need to offer support to employees with children , but which , for a variety of reasons , may not offer internal solutions such as an in-house daycare service . " there 's a realization among companies that half their workforce is made up of younger women , especially in the banking sector , in consulting , and in law offices , " erler said .
" companies are losing out if women decide to leave their jobs in order to raise a family - that 's incredibly expensive , and makes no sense .
that 's why companies are starting to do something about it themselves . " government incentive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german minister for family affairs renate schmidt on the cover of her book " sos family - without children , we 're starting to look old " to spur on the family-friendly company movement , the ministry for family affairs has launched a competition to name the nation 's top employers for parents .
a total of 366 firms entered the competition , though that number has since been whittled down to 35 companies of various sizes , and from various sectors .
the winners will be announced in may . " i 'm pleased about the high number of applicants and the wealth of ideas with which german companies hope to make themselves more family-friendly , " said renate schmidt , minister for family affairs .
" every single company can play a part in making germany a more family-friendly country , and in the meantime , industry has realized what an important factor this is for the future . " beate werhahn is optimistic that after what she calls a " value loss " in german society , the pendulum is starting to swing back towards more family values , even in the workplace .
she freely admits that having her baby was the best move she ever made in her career , because it 's made her a happier person . the happiness factor is not to be underestimated , according to gisela erler of familienservice .

community reparation orders can be imposed on those convicted of less serious crimes from monday .
the orders , which will be trialled in dundee , inverness and greenock , will force offenders to work between 10 and 100 hours for no pay .
justice minister cathy jamieson said courts were being given wider powers .
community service orders already exist for graver crimes .
it could mean that the yob who smashed a window spends a week repairing windows cathy jamieson justice minister the new orders , which can be used in cases heard without a jury in the district and sheriff courts , have been introduced as part of the controversial anti-social behaviour act .
the three trial areas were chosen because they are a mix of urban and semi-rural populations .
decisions on what type of work will be carried out will be taken by local authorities .
ms jamieson said : " the executive is committed to giving the courts access to the widest possible range of sentencing options , helping ensure each sentence fits the crime and creating a swifter , smarter justice system .
" community reparation orders are an excellent example of this .
" that could mean that the yob who smashed a window spends a week repairing windows - putting something back into the community while giving them an opportunity to enhance their life skills . "

olympic gold medallist chris hoy said the report was " a wake-up call " but local authorities said they were using limited funding in imaginative ways .
it is estimated that eight out of 10 scottish households own at least one bicycle .
in the first study of its kind , the performance of all 32 scottish councils was assessed .

cycling scotland 's chief executive erl wilkie said it created a benchmark which could allow councils to better serve cyclists and encourage others to adopt pedal power .

cycling scotland , the independent organisation which promotes cycling 's role in transport , carried out a national assessment of provision .
it found some innovative and successful schemes but said clusters of councils were not delivering for cyclists .
olympic gold medallist chris hoy said the report was " a wake-up call " but local authorities said they were using limited funding in imaginative ways .
it is estimated that eight out of 10 scottish households own at least one bicycle .
in the first study of its kind , the performance of all 32 scottish councils was assessed .
pedal power they were scored against a number of criteria , including cycling strategy and training , infrastructure and promotion of the sport .
cycling scotland 's chief executive erl wilkie said it created a benchmark which could allow councils to better serve cyclists and encourage others to adopt pedal power .
we need to do more to convince everyone to get on their bikes and local authorities are key to that chris hoy olympic gold medallist mr wilkie said : " our assessment shows that there is often a lack of joined-up thinking within local government when it comes to delivering for scotland 's cyclists .
" many authorities still regard cycling as being just about cycle paths and other engineering projects .
" however , the promotion of sustainable transport is about behaviour change .
the proven benefits in terms of health , leisure , education and social inclusion clearly show that cycling policy and strategy must be spread across council departments . "
mr hoy said : " there is still a long way to go if we want cycling take-up anywhere near as high as our european neighbours .
" we need to do more to convince everyone to get on their bikes and local authorities are key to that . "
the report recommends that national targets for cycling growth should be replaced by more meaningful local targets .
it also says that councils should appoint lead officers for cycling and develop broader cycling strategies .
we hope that cycling scotland will join us in arguing that walking and cycling must be key elements of the scottish executive 's new national transport strategy cosla spokesman the councils ' umbrella body cosla said that local government was committed to developing both cycling and walking .
a spokesman said : " it is easy to be critical , but the report being concentrated on cycling allows an oversimplification of the tough decisions facing councils in terms of spending priorities and use of limited human resources .
" much is happening in local authorities across the country .
" councils are using the limited funding available in a variety of imaginative ways , which encourage cycle use , allowing cyclists to get around more easily and safely . "
the spokesman said many local authorities also encouraged staff to travel to work by bike .

a team at goldsmiths college , london has concluded that being deprived of nicotine makes normally pleasurable things less enjoyable .
the research , revealed at the british psychological society 's annual conference , concludes that this may be the reason so many smokers relapse .
but anti-smoking groups point out smokers can still give up successfully using nicotine replacement therapy .
tests the research team recruited 200 smokers , all of whom smoked more than 10 cigarettes a day .
the volunteers were tested twice , each time after they had refrained from smoking for 12 hours .
on each occasion they received a lozenge that either contained nicotine or was a placebo .
they were all given a questionnaire assessing how pleasurable they expected certain activities to be , like eating their favourite food , or going out for the evening . "
smokers may find it harder to resist a cigarette simply because they ca n't resist the impulsive urge " " dr lynne dawkins the researchers found that the smokers deprived of nicotine expected these things to be less pleasurable than those who were given it .
the volunteers were also asked to sort cards , and offered money for doing it .
the nicotine-deprived volunteers did not respond to the incentive as well as the others .
dr lynne dawkins , who the led the research , said : " these results led us to conclude that giving up smoking must make many other things in life much less fun . "
impulse the researchers also found that smokers who had not been given nicotine found it harder to resist an impulsive urge - not looking at something that they were specifically told to ignore .
although the team have yet to apply their findings outside the laboratory , dr dawkins thinks this may be why the urge to reach for a cigarette is so strong .
" when smokers are faced with a situation where they 're tempted , they may find it harder to resist a cigarette simply because they ca n't resist the impulsive urge to smoke " .
further research dr dawkins resists any suggestion that the research will put smokers off giving up .
" i think by discovering this , we can turn it into a positive - it allows us to understand practically why people quit .
" the next stage is for us to identify why some people find it harder than others , and we 've already started that research . "
deborah arnott , director of action on smoking and health -lrb- ash -rrb- , adds : " there is a danger this research can be seen as negative .
but what it does really is remind people of something we already know , which is that it 's the nicotine you 're addicted to , not the smoking .
" so if you use nicotine-replacement therapy to help you give up , you stand a much better chance " .

a team at goldsmiths college , london has concluded that being deprived of nicotine makes normally pleasurable things less enjoyable .
the research , revealed at the british psychological society 's annual conference , concludes that this may be the reason so many smokers relapse .
but anti-smoking groups point out smokers can still give up successfully using nicotine replacement therapy .
tests the research team recruited 200 smokers , all of whom smoked more than 10 cigarettes a day .
the volunteers were tested twice , each time after they had refrained from smoking for 12 hours .
on each occasion they received a lozenge that either contained nicotine or was a placebo .
they were all given a questionnaire assessing how pleasurable they expected certain activities to be , like eating their favourite food , or going out for the evening .
smokers may find it harder to resist a cigarette simply because they ca n't resist the impulsive urge " dr lynne dawkins the researchers found that the smokers deprived of nicotine expected these things to be less pleasurable than those who were given it .
the volunteers were also asked to sort cards , and offered money for doing it .
the nicotine-deprived volunteers did not respond to the incentive as well as the others .
dr lynne dawkins , who the led the research , said : " these results led us to conclude that giving up smoking must make many other things in life much less fun . "
impulse the researchers also found that smokers who had not been given nicotine found it harder to resist an impulsive urge - not looking at something that they were specifically told to ignore .
although the team have yet to apply their findings outside the laboratory , dr dawkins thinks this may be why the urge to reach for a cigarette is so strong .
" when smokers are faced with a situation where they 're tempted , they may find it harder to resist a cigarette simply because they ca n't resist the impulsive urge to smoke " .
further research dr dawkins resists any suggestion that the research will put smokers off giving up .
" i think by discovering this , we can turn it into a positive - it allows us to understand practically why people quit .
" the next stage is for us to identify why some people find it harder than others , and we 've already started that research . "
deborah arnott , director of action on smoking and health -lrb- ash -rrb- , adds : " there is a danger this research can be seen as negative .
but what it does really is remind people of something we already know , which is that it 's the nicotine you 're addicted to , not the smoking .
" so if you use nicotine-replacement therapy to help you give up , you stand a much better chance " .

thirty years ago , the us company - which made a profit of $ 3.1bn -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- in the fourth quarter of 2004 - dominated the information technology market .
now the landscape is very different , with competitors such as hewlett-packard and dell taking it on on equal terms .
but things could have been very different for the company often referred to as ' big blue ' .
the company cut its teeth on mainframes and servers , but it might have ruled the personal computer market too - had it not been for certain decisions made more than 20 years ago .
pc revolution for decades ibm ruled every phase of the development of the industry - both in hardware and software .
nobody in the organisation saw that far from being an item in the future , -lsb- the pc -rsb- was the future robert heller , author and management consultant check ibm 's share price at the beginning of the 1980s , ibm was a leading developer of the pc .
other companies had explored the idea of producing a computer which would sit on every worker 's desk - apple , for one , produced a desktop computer in 1977 - but the name ibm gave the product mainstream credibility .
but ibm failed to realise the new product 's significance , says david bradley , one of the team of 12 who produced the pc at ibm .
" at the time , we did n't think it was going to be a revolutionary change , " he says .
" we knew we were working on an exciting project and we certainly hoped it was going to be successful , but we never imagined it was going to take over the world the way it did . "
' very clever ' ibm needed an operating system to run its new pc .
the company approached microsoft co-founder bill gates , then a 19-year-old college dropout .
he provided ibm with the pc operating system it required , but crucially the company allowed mr gates to hold on to the property rights of the system - a mistake , at least from ibm 's point of view , not lost on mr gates .
" we had to be very clever , we actually did not get a royalty from ibm but we kept the rights so we were getting royalties from other people , " mr gates told the bbc in 1994 .
" it was only as -lsb- the operating system -rsb- grew in volume and power that then ibm recognised that having us control such a key aspect might be a mistake for them . "
still , in 1985 ibm was the most profitable company in the world , making profits of almost $ 6.6bn.
but it relied on income generated from its core business - mainframe systems for corporate customers .
major losses author and management consultant robert heller says ibm did not understand the importance of the pc .
all smiles - ibm is selling its pc business to lenovo of china " the ibm people never took it seriously at that stage .
nobody in the organisation saw that far from being an item in the future , it was the future , " he says .
in 1993 , ibm stunned the world by reporting quarterly losses of $ 8bn , caused by increased competition and a changing market .
ibm was failing to compete with the new breed of innovative software companies and hardware producers who could make computers much more cheaply .
" prices for mainframe computers dropped , eventually they dropped by 90 % , " says mr heller .
" this was an immense blow to ibm .
it lost money , it lost market share and became a company in denial .
it could n't believe it was no longer the dominant force in computing . "
chinese deal it was time for ibm to break with tradition , and for the first time an outsider , louis gerstner , was brought in to head up the company .
tens of thousands of jobs were cut worldwide and the company moved into business services .
the seminal moment in this shift away from its roots came in december last year with the announcement of the $ 1.75bn sale of ibm 's once revolutionary pc business to the chinese company lenovo .
under the terms of the deal , ibm will gain valuable access to huge chinese markets for its services .
but the company will be exiting a market it pioneered , and which many critics believe is better left now to low cost manufacturers .

thirty years ago , the us company - which made a profit of $ 3.1bn -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- in the fourth quarter of 2004 - dominated the information technology market .
now the landscape is very different , with competitors such as hewlett-packard and dell taking it on on equal terms .
but things could have been very different for the company often referred to as ' big blue ' .
the company cut its teeth on mainframes and servers , but it might have ruled the personal computer market too - had it not been for certain decisions made more than 20 years ago .
pc revolution for decades ibm ruled every phase of the development of the industry - both in hardware and software .
nobody in the organisation saw that far from being an item in the future , -lsb- the pc -rsb- was the future robert heller , author and management consultant check ibm 's share price at the beginning of the 1980s , ibm was a leading developer of the pc .
other companies had explored the idea of producing a computer which would sit on every worker 's desk - apple , for one , produced a desktop computer in 1977 - but the name ibm gave the product mainstream credibility .
but ibm failed to realise the new product 's significance , says david bradley , one of the team of 12 who produced the pc at ibm .
" at the time , we did n't think it was going to be a revolutionary change , " he says .
" we knew we were working on an exciting project and we certainly hoped it was going to be successful , but we never imagined it was going to take over the world the way it did . "
' very clever ' ibm needed an operating system to run its new pc .
the company approached microsoft co-founder bill gates , then a 19-year-old college dropout .
he provided ibm with the pc operating system it required , but crucially the company allowed mr gates to hold on to the property rights of the system - a mistake , at least from ibm 's point of view , not lost on mr gates .
" we had to be very clever , we actually did not get a royalty from ibm but we kept the rights so we were getting royalties from other people , " mr gates told the bbc in 1994 .
" it was only as -lsb- the operating system -rsb- grew in volume and power that then ibm recognised that having us control such a key aspect might be a mistake for them . "
still , in 1985 ibm was the most profitable company in the world , making profits of almost $ 6.6bn.
but it relied on income generated from its core business - mainframe systems for corporate customers .
major losses author and management consultant robert heller says ibm did not understand the importance of the pc .
all smiles - ibm is selling its pc business to lenovo of china " the ibm people never took it seriously at that stage .
nobody in the organisation saw that far from being an item in the future , it was the future , " he says .
in 1993 , ibm stunned the world by reporting quarterly losses of $ 8bn , caused by increased competition and a changing market .
ibm was failing to compete with the new breed of innovative software companies and hardware producers who could make computers much more cheaply .
" prices for mainframe computers dropped , eventually they dropped by 90 % , " says mr heller .
" this was an immense blow to ibm .
it lost money , it lost market share and became a company in denial .
it could n't believe it was no longer the dominant force in computing . "
chinese deal it was time for ibm to break with tradition , and for the first time an outsider , louis gerstner , was brought in to head up the company .
tens of thousands of jobs were cut worldwide and the company moved into business services .
the seminal moment in this shift away from its roots came in december last year with the announcement of the $ 1.75bn sale of ibm 's once revolutionary pc business to the chinese company lenovo .
under the terms of the deal , ibm will gain valuable access to huge chinese markets for its services .

supporters from the three main political parties are backing calls for a review of a 135-year-old law which bars offenders from elections .
they argue that a ban does nothing to deter prisoners from crime and that voting is an " inalienable human right " .
but opponents say those excluded from society should not have a say over the way it is governed .
' civic death ' backing the barred from voting campaign , among others , are former tory home secretary lord douglas hurd , liberal democrat president simon hughes and labour peer baroness kennedy qc .
former chief inspector of prisons sir david rambsbotham argues that giving prisoners the vote will help to increase their sense of civic duty .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme that the current law went back to the time when prisoners were sentenced to " civic death " .
" prisoners remain citizens of this country .
they 've had their liberty removed nothing else .
they have n't had their citizens rights removed .
" what is more 62,000 of them ... are going to come out as citizens and one of the jobs of prisons is to make them better citizens . "
if prisoners are excluded from voting then we do n't have a democratic society , we are just paying lip service to one bobby cummines unlock but former conservative prisons minister ann widdecombe said : " when a judge has taken a decision that somebody 's crimes are of such an order of magnitude that they need to be taken out of society , then it does seem perverse to hand that same person a say in how that society is governed . "
the prison reform trust and ex-offenders ' organisation unlock are spearheading the campaign .
trust director juliet lyon said : " people are sent to prison to lose their liberty not their identity .
" prisoners should be given every opportunity to pay back for what they have done , take responsibility for their lives and make plans for effective resettlement and this should include maintaining their right to vote .
" it 's time to stop pretending that people in prison do n't exist . "
unlock chief executive bobby cummines said it was a question of moral , not political conscience , adding that prisoners had human rights .
" if prisoners are excluded from voting then we do n't have a democratic society , we are just paying lip service to one . "
government appeal supporters also claim that only seven other european countries prohibit prisoner voting .
the campaign comes after the european court of human rights ruled that preventing prisoners from voting breached their human rights .
it followed the case of british prisoner john hirst who took his case to the strasbourg court .
the government argues that those who commit a serious crime should lose the right to have a say in how society is governed .
a government appeal against the judgment is set to be heard on 27 april and a final ruling will be made later in the year .
the current uk law dates back to the forfeiture act of 1870 - which is based on the notion of civic death , a punishment which involves the withdrawal of citizenship rights .

supporters from the three main political parties are backing calls for a review of a 135-year-old law which bars offenders from elections .
they argue that a ban does nothing to deter prisoners from crime and that voting is an " inalienable human right " .
but opponents say those excluded from society should not have a say over the way it is governed .
' civic death ' backing the barred from voting campaign , among others , are former tory home secretary lord douglas hurd , liberal democrat president simon hughes and labour peer baroness kennedy qc .
former chief inspector of prisons sir david rambsbotham argues that giving prisoners the vote will help to increase their sense of civic duty .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme that the current law went back to the time when prisoners were sentenced to " civic death " .
" prisoners remain citizens of this country .
they 've had their liberty removed nothing else .
they have n't had their citizens rights removed .
" what is more 62,000 of them ... are going to come out as citizens and one of the jobs of prisons is to make them better citizens . "
if prisoners are excluded from voting then we do n't have a democratic society , we are just paying lip service to one bobby cummines unlock but former conservative prisons minister ann widdecombe said : " when a judge has taken a decision that somebody 's crimes are of such an order of magnitude that they need to be taken out of society , then it does seem perverse to hand that same person a say in how that society is governed . "
the prison reform trust and ex-offenders ' organisation unlock are spearheading the campaign .
trust director juliet lyon said : " people are sent to prison to lose their liberty not their identity .
" prisoners should be given every opportunity to pay back for what they have done , take responsibility for their lives and make plans for effective resettlement and this should include maintaining their right to vote .
" it 's time to stop pretending that people in prison do n't exist . "
unlock chief executive bobby cummines said it was a question of moral , not political conscience , adding that prisoners had human rights .
" if prisoners are excluded from voting then we do n't have a democratic society , we are just paying lip service to one . "
government appeal supporters also claim that only seven other european countries prohibit prisoner voting .
the campaign comes after the european court of human rights ruled that preventing prisoners from voting breached their human rights .
it followed the case of british prisoner john hirst who took his case to the strasbourg court .
the government argues that those who commit a serious crime should lose the right to have a say in how society is governed .
a government appeal against the judgment is set to be heard on 27 april and a final ruling will be made later in the year .
the current uk law dates back to the forfeiture act of 1870 - which is based on the notion of civic death , a punishment which involves the withdrawal of citizenship rights .
the campaign is also being backed by labour peer lord corbett , liberal democrat peer lord dholakia .

" prisoners should be given every opportunity to pay back for what they have done , take responsibility for their lives and make plans for effective resettlement and this should include maintaining their right to vote .
" it 's time to stop pretending that people in prison do n't exist . "
unlock chief executive bobby cummines said it was a question of moral , not political conscience , adding that prisoners had human rights .
" if prisoners are excluded from voting then we do n't have a democratic society , we are just paying lip service to one . "
government appeal supporters also claim that only seven other european countries prohibit prisoner voting .
the campaign comes after the european court of human rights ruled that preventing prisoners from voting breached their human rights .
it followed the case of british prisoner john hirst who took his case to the strasbourg court .
the government argues that those who commit a serious crime should lose the right to have a say in how society is governed .
a government appeal against the judgment is set to be heard on 27 april and a final ruling will be made later in the year .
the current uk law dates back to the forfeiture act of 1870 - which is based on the notion of civic death , a punishment which involves the withdrawal of citizenship rights .
the campaign is also being backed by labour peer lord corbett , liberal democrat peer lord dholakia .
