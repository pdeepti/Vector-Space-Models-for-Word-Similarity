a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe .

despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .

a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe . " the jüdische zeitu n g devotes quite a few column inches to small , liberal jewish communities which are not represented by the central council of jews , and which therefore come up short in the council 's jüdische allgemei n e . no critical questio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of the new synagogue , center , and the building of the jewish parish , left , in dresden , eastern germany , on wednesday .
despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .

the former royals hope to raise at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- , but not all family members are happy with the decision . the house of hanover - also known as the welfen - is one grandest and oldest royal families of europe .
it has spawned many english kings and is famous for having built most of its wealth through marriage rather than through war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince ernst august of hanover but the family 's peaceful image has n't fared quite so well in recent years .
the controversial head of the family , prince ernst august , has gained notoriety for his fist fights with the paparazzi and frequent court appearances . now the prince , who is the third husband of princess caroline of monacco , has allowed his two sons to sell most of the family 's art collection so they can set up a fund to maintain the 130-room family castle - marienburg . hundreds of potential buyers , collectors and aristocrats have made the trip to the welfen headquarters for the auction , which runs until oct.15. great results the prince 's cultural advisor , christoph von douglas , said the opening days of the auction have been a great success . bildunterschrift : suits of armor up for sale at marienburg castle " the money brought in by the auction so far is almost three times our conservative estimate , and double what we 'd hoped , " he said .
" we never thought we 'd do this well , especially with some of these more ' difficult ' portraits and these antique weapons , which can be difficult to sell these days .
the result is just great . " twenty thousand items - from oil paintings to armor - are destined to go home with the highest bidders in what experts say could be the last royal auction europe will ever see . with up to 40 items changing hands each hour , sotheby 's auctioneer patrick von mares said he has his work cut out for him . " we 've received bids from all around the world , " he said .
" i saw that every telephone operator was actively bidding - it was quite a spectacle .
it was great to see how someone would bid 15,000 and the next would hit straight back with 18,000 , then 20,000 .
it was a wonderful atmosphere . " irresistible bargai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this vest of former english king george iv may have attracted royal bidders .
von mares added that most of the bidders in the gallery are art dealers or private buyers , while most of the bidders manning the 100 phone lines are representatives of various royal families . but the auction has attracted a number of curious onlookers , too .
some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .
i think i 'll just put it on my desk and open letters with it - why not ? " selli n g out ? but not everyone is happy with the auction .
the prince 's own brother , heinrich von hannover , has been a vocal critic of ernst august 's decision to sell off the family silver . " he needs to understand that he 's lost his standing in the family because he 's selling off our cultural heritage - or at least part of it , " heinrich said .

a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief .

despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .

some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .

the former royals hope to raise at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- , but not all family members are happy with the decision . the house of hanover - also known as the welfen - is one grandest and oldest royal families of europe .
it has spawned many english kings and is famous for having built most of its wealth through marriage rather than through war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince ernst august of hanover but the family 's peaceful image has n't fared quite so well in recent years .
the controversial head of the family , prince ernst august , has gained notoriety for his fist fights with the paparazzi and frequent court appearances . now the prince , who is the third husband of princess caroline of monacco , has allowed his two sons to sell most of the family 's art collection so they can set up a fund to maintain the 130-room family castle - marienburg . hundreds of potential buyers , collectors and aristocrats have made the trip to the welfen headquarters for the auction , which runs until oct.15. great results the prince 's cultural advisor , christoph von douglas , said the opening days of the auction have been a great success . bildunterschrift : suits of armor up for sale at marienburg castle " the money brought in by the auction so far is almost three times our conservative estimate , and double what we 'd hoped , " he said .
" we never thought we 'd do this well , especially with some of these more ' difficult ' portraits and these antique weapons , which can be difficult to sell these days .
the result is just great . " twenty thousand items - from oil paintings to armor - are destined to go home with the highest bidders in what experts say could be the last royal auction europe will ever see . with up to 40 items changing hands each hour , sotheby 's auctioneer patrick von mares said he has his work cut out for him . " we 've received bids from all around the world , " he said .
" i saw that every telephone operator was actively bidding - it was quite a spectacle .
it was great to see how someone would bid 15,000 and the next would hit straight back with 18,000 , then 20,000 .
it was a wonderful atmosphere . " irresistible bargai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this vest of former english king george iv may have attracted royal bidders .
von mares added that most of the bidders in the gallery are art dealers or private buyers , while most of the bidders manning the 100 phone lines are representatives of various royal families . but the auction has attracted a number of curious onlookers , too .
some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .
i think i 'll just put it on my desk and open letters with it - why not ? " selli n g out ? but not everyone is happy with the auction .

a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe . " the jüdische zeitu n g devotes quite a few column inches to small , liberal jewish communities which are not represented by the central council of jews , and which therefore come up short in the council 's jüdische allgemei n e . no critical questio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of the new synagogue , center , and the building of the jewish parish , left , in dresden , eastern germany , on wednesday .
despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .

sources within schröder 's social democrats said that a further meeting is scheduled for 11 a.m. local time . the conservatives , who finished just four seats ahead of schröder 's party in sept.18 elections , have put intense pressure on german chancellor gerhard schröder to step down and allow merkel to become the first female head of germany 's government . groomi n g merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily meanwhile had renewed calls for a solution that would see schröder remain chancellor for two years with merkel taking over for the next two years . " it would strengthen the necessary trust of both parties in each other and would stabilize a grand coalition , " schily told sunday 's edition of the fra n kfurter allgemei n e newspaper . he suggested merkel should be foreign minister to begin with , building " the international contacts she does n't have at the moment and which she would urgently need as a chancellor . " but christian wulff , a leading member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the only issue the conservatives would not concede was the chancellery . " the union will only be in a government led by angela merkel , " wulff told saturday 's passauer neue presse newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.10.2005 jewish paper aims for german audience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new paper aims to reach a cross-section of jews in germany jewish life in germany is much more diverse than it 's often portrayed to be in the german media .
a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe . " the jüdische zeitu n g devotes quite a few column inches to small , liberal jewish communities which are not represented by the central council of jews , and which therefore come up short in the council 's jüdische allgemei n e . no critical questio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of the new synagogue , center , and the building of the jewish parish , left , in dresden , eastern germany , on wednesday .
despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .
if they do , the paper hopes to make a significant contribution to the integration of russian-jewish immigrants in germany . igal avidan -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

more than 18,000 deaths have been confirmed so far . at least 18,350 people have been officially confirmed dead in the huge earthquake which struck in northern pakistan saturday and measured at least 7.6 on the richter scale .
with the disaster zone spreading through pakistan and parts of india and afghanistan , the death toll is expected to spiral even higher as the relief efforts get underway .
as many as 30,000 people are estimated to have been killed in pakistani-controlled kashmir alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani soldiers rescue victims from kashmir a day after the disaster , pakistan president general pervez musharraf appealed to the international community to assist with disaster relief , the country 's state-run news agency reported .
musharraf was quoted as saying pakistan required medicine , tents , cargo helicopters and financial assistance to help survivors .
" we do seek international assistance , we have enough manpower but we need financial support so that we may … cope with the tragedy . "
he said supplies were needed " to reach out to the people in far-flung and cut-off areas " . swift global response around the globe , countries responded swiftly to the disaster , with letters of condolence and offers of humanitarian and financial help pouring in . us president george w. bush , whose country is still coping with the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita , said help was on the way to the victims of what he referred to as a " horrible tragedy . "
other international leaders expressed shock and sadness . un secretary general kofi annan said he was " deeply saddened by the loss of life and destruction " caused by the earthquake .

several british search and resuce teams were expected to be sent . in berlin , foreign minister joschka fischer said germany had immediately released 50,000 euros to be made available to pakistani authorities through berlin 's embassy in islamabad .
humanitarian organizations have already begun calling for donations , and the german government is working closely with groups such as the red cross to organize relief efforts in the disaster zone . rescue teams en route turkey , a frequent victim of deadly earthquakes , offered aid to fellow muslim country pakistan , anatolia news agency reported , quoting foreign minister abdullah gul .

up until now it was not clear how bad these far-flung regions had been impacted by the quake . the german aid organization misereor announced from its headquarters in aachen that it had approved immediate assistance of 50,000 euros for rural regions , where entire towns have been decimated by giant mud slides . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers help to asian quake victims germany and other european countries responded swiftly to saturday 's massive earthquake which hit pakistan , india and afghanistan , offering aid and funds as well as condolences .

sources within schröder 's social democrats said that a further meeting is scheduled for 11 a.m. local time . the conservatives , who finished just four seats ahead of schröder 's party in sept.18 elections , have put intense pressure on german chancellor gerhard schröder to step down and allow merkel to become the first female head of germany 's government . groomi n g merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily meanwhile had renewed calls for a solution that would see schröder remain chancellor for two years with merkel taking over for the next two years . " it would strengthen the necessary trust of both parties in each other and would stabilize a grand coalition , " schily told sunday 's edition of the fra n kfurter allgemei n e newspaper . he suggested merkel should be foreign minister to begin with , building " the international contacts she does n't have at the moment and which she would urgently need as a chancellor . " but christian wulff , a leading member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the only issue the conservatives would not concede was the chancellery .

a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe . " the jüdische zeitu n g devotes quite a few column inches to small , liberal jewish communities which are not represented by the central council of jews , and which therefore come up short in the council 's jüdische allgemei n e . no critical questio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of the new synagogue , center , and the building of the jewish parish , left , in dresden , eastern germany , on wednesday .
despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .
if they do , the paper hopes to make a significant contribution to the integration of russian-jewish immigrants in germany . igal avidan -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

the former royals hope to raise at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- , but not all family members are happy with the decision . the house of hanover - also known as the welfen - is one grandest and oldest royal families of europe .
it has spawned many english kings and is famous for having built most of its wealth through marriage rather than through war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince ernst august of hanover but the family 's peaceful image has n't fared quite so well in recent years .
the controversial head of the family , prince ernst august , has gained notoriety for his fist fights with the paparazzi and frequent court appearances . now the prince , who is the third husband of princess caroline of monacco , has allowed his two sons to sell most of the family 's art collection so they can set up a fund to maintain the 130-room family castle - marienburg . hundreds of potential buyers , collectors and aristocrats have made the trip to the welfen headquarters for the auction , which runs until oct.15. great results the prince 's cultural advisor , christoph von douglas , said the opening days of the auction have been a great success . bildunterschrift : suits of armor up for sale at marienburg castle " the money brought in by the auction so far is almost three times our conservative estimate , and double what we 'd hoped , " he said .
" we never thought we 'd do this well , especially with some of these more ' difficult ' portraits and these antique weapons , which can be difficult to sell these days .
the result is just great . " twenty thousand items - from oil paintings to armor - are destined to go home with the highest bidders in what experts say could be the last royal auction europe will ever see . with up to 40 items changing hands each hour , sotheby 's auctioneer patrick von mares said he has his work cut out for him . " we 've received bids from all around the world , " he said .
" i saw that every telephone operator was actively bidding - it was quite a spectacle .
it was great to see how someone would bid 15,000 and the next would hit straight back with 18,000 , then 20,000 .
it was a wonderful atmosphere . " irresistible bargai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this vest of former english king george iv may have attracted royal bidders .
von mares added that most of the bidders in the gallery are art dealers or private buyers , while most of the bidders manning the 100 phone lines are representatives of various royal families . but the auction has attracted a number of curious onlookers , too .
some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .
i think i 'll just put it on my desk and open letters with it - why not ? " selli n g out ? but not everyone is happy with the auction .
the prince 's own brother , heinrich von hannover , has been a vocal critic of ernst august 's decision to sell off the family silver . " he needs to understand that he 's lost his standing in the family because he 's selling off our cultural heritage - or at least part of it , " heinrich said .
" what i 'm criticizing is that my family has in fact lost power through this .
i would n't say it 's caused a rift within the family , but the whole thing certainly is regrettable . " bildunterschrift : marienburg castle will be opened to visitors . but prince ernst august stands by his decision .

and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe . " the jüdische zeitu n g devotes quite a few column inches to small , liberal jewish communities which are not represented by the central council of jews , and which therefore come up short in the council 's jüdische allgemei n e . no critical questio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of the new synagogue , center , and the building of the jewish parish , left , in dresden , eastern germany , on wednesday .
despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .
if they do , the paper hopes to make a significant contribution to the integration of russian-jewish immigrants in germany . igal avidan -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society .

sources within schröder 's social democrats said that a further meeting is scheduled for 11 a.m. local time . the conservatives , who finished just four seats ahead of schröder 's party in sept.18 elections , have put intense pressure on german chancellor gerhard schröder to step down and allow merkel to become the first female head of germany 's government . groomi n g merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily meanwhile had renewed calls for a solution that would see schröder remain chancellor for two years with merkel taking over for the next two years . " it would strengthen the necessary trust of both parties in each other and would stabilize a grand coalition , " schily told sunday 's edition of the fra n kfurter allgemei n e newspaper . he suggested merkel should be foreign minister to begin with , building " the international contacts she does n't have at the moment and which she would urgently need as a chancellor . " but christian wulff , a leading member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the only issue the conservatives would not concede was the chancellery .

a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe . " the jüdische zeitu n g devotes quite a few column inches to small , liberal jewish communities which are not represented by the central council of jews , and which therefore come up short in the council 's jüdische allgemei n e . no critical questio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of the new synagogue , center , and the building of the jewish parish , left , in dresden , eastern germany , on wednesday .
despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .

and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe .

despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .

a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .

the former royals hope to raise at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- , but not all family members are happy with the decision . the house of hanover - also known as the welfen - is one grandest and oldest royal families of europe .
it has spawned many english kings and is famous for having built most of its wealth through marriage rather than through war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince ernst august of hanover but the family 's peaceful image has n't fared quite so well in recent years .
the controversial head of the family , prince ernst august , has gained notoriety for his fist fights with the paparazzi and frequent court appearances . now the prince , who is the third husband of princess caroline of monacco , has allowed his two sons to sell most of the family 's art collection so they can set up a fund to maintain the 130-room family castle - marienburg . hundreds of potential buyers , collectors and aristocrats have made the trip to the welfen headquarters for the auction , which runs until oct.15. great results the prince 's cultural advisor , christoph von douglas , said the opening days of the auction have been a great success . bildunterschrift : suits of armor up for sale at marienburg castle " the money brought in by the auction so far is almost three times our conservative estimate , and double what we 'd hoped , " he said .
" we never thought we 'd do this well , especially with some of these more ' difficult ' portraits and these antique weapons , which can be difficult to sell these days .
the result is just great . " twenty thousand items - from oil paintings to armor - are destined to go home with the highest bidders in what experts say could be the last royal auction europe will ever see . with up to 40 items changing hands each hour , sotheby 's auctioneer patrick von mares said he has his work cut out for him . " we 've received bids from all around the world , " he said .
" i saw that every telephone operator was actively bidding - it was quite a spectacle .
it was great to see how someone would bid 15,000 and the next would hit straight back with 18,000 , then 20,000 .
it was a wonderful atmosphere . " irresistible bargai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this vest of former english king george iv may have attracted royal bidders .
von mares added that most of the bidders in the gallery are art dealers or private buyers , while most of the bidders manning the 100 phone lines are representatives of various royal families . but the auction has attracted a number of curious onlookers , too .
some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .
i think i 'll just put it on my desk and open letters with it - why not ? " selli n g out ? but not everyone is happy with the auction .
the prince 's own brother , heinrich von hannover , has been a vocal critic of ernst august 's decision to sell off the family silver . " he needs to understand that he 's lost his standing in the family because he 's selling off our cultural heritage - or at least part of it , " heinrich said .

sources within schröder 's social democrats said that a further meeting is scheduled for 11 a.m. local time . the conservatives , who finished just four seats ahead of schröder 's party in sept.18 elections , have put intense pressure on german chancellor gerhard schröder to step down and allow merkel to become the first female head of germany 's government . groomi n g merkel ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily meanwhile had renewed calls for a solution that would see schröder remain chancellor for two years with merkel taking over for the next two years . " it would strengthen the necessary trust of both parties in each other and would stabilize a grand coalition , " schily told sunday 's edition of the fra n kfurter allgemei n e newspaper . he suggested merkel should be foreign minister to begin with , building " the international contacts she does n't have at the moment and which she would urgently need as a chancellor . " but christian wulff , a leading member of merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said the only issue the conservatives would not concede was the chancellery . " the union will only be in a government led by angela merkel , " wulff told saturday 's passauer neue presse newspaper .

a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief .

" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe .

despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .

a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .

the former royals hope to raise at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- , but not all family members are happy with the decision . the house of hanover - also known as the welfen - is one grandest and oldest royal families of europe .
it has spawned many english kings and is famous for having built most of its wealth through marriage rather than through war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince ernst august of hanover but the family 's peaceful image has n't fared quite so well in recent years .
the controversial head of the family , prince ernst august , has gained notoriety for his fist fights with the paparazzi and frequent court appearances . now the prince , who is the third husband of princess caroline of monacco , has allowed his two sons to sell most of the family 's art collection so they can set up a fund to maintain the 130-room family castle - marienburg . hundreds of potential buyers , collectors and aristocrats have made the trip to the welfen headquarters for the auction , which runs until oct.15. great results the prince 's cultural advisor , christoph von douglas , said the opening days of the auction have been a great success . bildunterschrift : suits of armor up for sale at marienburg castle " the money brought in by the auction so far is almost three times our conservative estimate , and double what we 'd hoped , " he said .
" we never thought we 'd do this well , especially with some of these more ' difficult ' portraits and these antique weapons , which can be difficult to sell these days .
the result is just great . " twenty thousand items - from oil paintings to armor - are destined to go home with the highest bidders in what experts say could be the last royal auction europe will ever see . with up to 40 items changing hands each hour , sotheby 's auctioneer patrick von mares said he has his work cut out for him . " we 've received bids from all around the world , " he said .
" i saw that every telephone operator was actively bidding - it was quite a spectacle .
it was great to see how someone would bid 15,000 and the next would hit straight back with 18,000 , then 20,000 .
it was a wonderful atmosphere . " irresistible bargai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this vest of former english king george iv may have attracted royal bidders .
von mares added that most of the bidders in the gallery are art dealers or private buyers , while most of the bidders manning the 100 phone lines are representatives of various royal families . but the auction has attracted a number of curious onlookers , too .
some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .
i think i 'll just put it on my desk and open letters with it - why not ? " selli n g out ? but not everyone is happy with the auction .
the prince 's own brother , heinrich von hannover , has been a vocal critic of ernst august 's decision to sell off the family silver . " he needs to understand that he 's lost his standing in the family because he 's selling off our cultural heritage - or at least part of it , " heinrich said .
" what i 'm criticizing is that my family has in fact lost power through this .
i would n't say it 's caused a rift within the family , but the whole thing certainly is regrettable . " bildunterschrift : marienburg castle will be opened to visitors . but prince ernst august stands by his decision .
he said his two sons will retain a few pieces of art from the family collection and open the castle to the paying public . sam edmonds -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's birthplace to fetch fortune the modest bavarian home that was the birthplace of pope benedict xvi is up for grabs , but you 'd have to be seriously wealthy to buy it .
bidders include an oil sheikh , and the price has skyrocketed into the millions .

some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .

the prince 's own brother , heinrich von hannover , has been a vocal critic of ernst august 's decision to sell off the family silver . " he needs to understand that he 's lost his standing in the family because he 's selling off our cultural heritage - or at least part of it , " heinrich said .
" what i 'm criticizing is that my family has in fact lost power through this .
i would n't say it 's caused a rift within the family , but the whole thing certainly is regrettable . " bildunterschrift : marienburg castle will be opened to visitors . but prince ernst august stands by his decision .

" we never thought we 'd do this well , especially with some of these more ' difficult ' portraits and these antique weapons , which can be difficult to sell these days .
the result is just great . " twenty thousand items - from oil paintings to armor - are destined to go home with the highest bidders in what experts say could be the last royal auction europe will ever see . with up to 40 items changing hands each hour , sotheby 's auctioneer patrick von mares said he has his work cut out for him . " we 've received bids from all around the world , " he said .
" i saw that every telephone operator was actively bidding - it was quite a spectacle .
it was great to see how someone would bid 15,000 and the next would hit straight back with 18,000 , then 20,000 .
it was a wonderful atmosphere . " irresistible bargai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this vest of former english king george iv may have attracted royal bidders .
von mares added that most of the bidders in the gallery are art dealers or private buyers , while most of the bidders manning the 100 phone lines are representatives of various royal families . but the auction has attracted a number of curious onlookers , too .
some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .
i think i 'll just put it on my desk and open letters with it - why not ? " selli n g out ? but not everyone is happy with the auction .
the prince 's own brother , heinrich von hannover , has been a vocal critic of ernst august 's decision to sell off the family silver . " he needs to understand that he 's lost his standing in the family because he 's selling off our cultural heritage - or at least part of it , " heinrich said .
" what i 'm criticizing is that my family has in fact lost power through this .
i would n't say it 's caused a rift within the family , but the whole thing certainly is regrettable . " bildunterschrift : marienburg castle will be opened to visitors . but prince ernst august stands by his decision .
he said his two sons will retain a few pieces of art from the family collection and open the castle to the paying public . sam edmonds -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's birthplace to fetch fortune the modest bavarian home that was the birthplace of pope benedict xvi is up for grabs , but you 'd have to be seriously wealthy to buy it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.10.2005 jewish paper aims for german audience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new paper aims to reach a cross-section of jews in germany jewish life in germany is much more diverse than it 's often portrayed to be in the german media .
a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe . " the jüdische zeitu n g devotes quite a few column inches to small , liberal jewish communities which are not represented by the central council of jews , and which therefore come up short in the council 's jüdische allgemei n e . no critical questio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of the new synagogue , center , and the building of the jewish parish , left , in dresden , eastern germany , on wednesday .
despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .
if they do , the paper hopes to make a significant contribution to the integration of russian-jewish immigrants in germany . igal avidan -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

the former royals hope to raise at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- , but not all family members are happy with the decision . the house of hanover - also known as the welfen - is one grandest and oldest royal families of europe .
it has spawned many english kings and is famous for having built most of its wealth through marriage rather than through war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince ernst august of hanover but the family 's peaceful image has n't fared quite so well in recent years .
the controversial head of the family , prince ernst august , has gained notoriety for his fist fights with the paparazzi and frequent court appearances . now the prince , who is the third husband of princess caroline of monacco , has allowed his two sons to sell most of the family 's art collection so they can set up a fund to maintain the 130-room family castle - marienburg . hundreds of potential buyers , collectors and aristocrats have made the trip to the welfen headquarters for the auction , which runs until oct.15. great results the prince 's cultural advisor , christoph von douglas , said the opening days of the auction have been a great success . bildunterschrift : suits of armor up for sale at marienburg castle " the money brought in by the auction so far is almost three times our conservative estimate , and double what we 'd hoped , " he said .
" we never thought we 'd do this well , especially with some of these more ' difficult ' portraits and these antique weapons , which can be difficult to sell these days .
the result is just great . " twenty thousand items - from oil paintings to armor - are destined to go home with the highest bidders in what experts say could be the last royal auction europe will ever see . with up to 40 items changing hands each hour , sotheby 's auctioneer patrick von mares said he has his work cut out for him . " we 've received bids from all around the world , " he said .
" i saw that every telephone operator was actively bidding - it was quite a spectacle .
it was great to see how someone would bid 15,000 and the next would hit straight back with 18,000 , then 20,000 .
it was a wonderful atmosphere . " irresistible bargai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this vest of former english king george iv may have attracted royal bidders .
von mares added that most of the bidders in the gallery are art dealers or private buyers , while most of the bidders manning the 100 phone lines are representatives of various royal families . but the auction has attracted a number of curious onlookers , too .
some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .
i think i 'll just put it on my desk and open letters with it - why not ? " selli n g out ? but not everyone is happy with the auction .
the prince 's own brother , heinrich von hannover , has been a vocal critic of ernst august 's decision to sell off the family silver . " he needs to understand that he 's lost his standing in the family because he 's selling off our cultural heritage - or at least part of it , " heinrich said .
" what i 'm criticizing is that my family has in fact lost power through this .
i would n't say it 's caused a rift within the family , but the whole thing certainly is regrettable . " bildunterschrift : marienburg castle will be opened to visitors . but prince ernst august stands by his decision .
he said his two sons will retain a few pieces of art from the family collection and open the castle to the paying public . sam edmonds -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's birthplace to fetch fortune the modest bavarian home that was the birthplace of pope benedict xvi is up for grabs , but you 'd have to be seriously wealthy to buy it .

a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe .

despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .

a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe . " the jüdische zeitu n g devotes quite a few column inches to small , liberal jewish communities which are not represented by the central council of jews , and which therefore come up short in the council 's jüdische allgemei n e . no critical questio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of the new synagogue , center , and the building of the jewish parish , left , in dresden , eastern germany , on wednesday .
despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.10.2005 jewish paper aims for german audience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new paper aims to reach a cross-section of jews in germany jewish life in germany is much more diverse than it 's often portrayed to be in the german media .
a new german-language jewish newspaper , the " jüdische zeitung , " hopes to capture that diversity . the new jüdische zeitu n g , published by russian-jewish publisher nicholas werner 's werner media group , does n't claim to be competition for the weekly jüdische allgemei n e zeitu n g , the mouthpiece for the central council of jews in germany . however , on page one of its first edition , it did n't hesitate to call into question the central council 's role as the exclusive representative body for jews in germany .
and it says it wants to be something the jüdische allgemei n e is n't - truly independent . having made its debut in september , werner media plans to publish the new paper on a monthly basis at first , before switching to a twice-monthly format . among the jüdische zeitu n g 's potential readers is the younger generation of jewish immigrants from the former soviet union .
some 90,000 russian jews have immigrated to germany in the past 15 years , and now make up the majority of jews in germany .
germans with an interest in jewish culture and religion would also find the paper interesting , said its editor-in-chief . " one of our goals is to reach younger readers , because the young generation of russian-speaking jews is n't really reading russian newspapers anymore , " mikhail goldberg said .
" despite this , they are interested in judaism , as well as events in eastern europe . " the jüdische zeitu n g devotes quite a few column inches to small , liberal jewish communities which are not represented by the central council of jews , and which therefore come up short in the council 's jüdische allgemei n e . no critical questio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of the new synagogue , center , and the building of the jewish parish , left , in dresden , eastern germany , on wednesday .
despite its claim to independence , the paper has already run into criticism for not being balanced in its reporting .
the jüdische zeitu n g intentionally refrains from asking interview partners critical questions , whether the interview partner is a liberal jewish personality such as walter homolka , governor of the world union for progressive judaism , or an orthodox jew such as canadian-born rabbi joshua spinner . " i would n't say we 're not critical , but rather that our primary aim is to describe the current state of things , " goldberg said .
" it 's not always the role of a newspaper to judge things , that 's the role of the reader , i 'd say . " for goldberg , the first edition of the jüdische zeitu n g is also a personal success .
when he came to berlin from kiev in 1994 , he could barely speak german .
a civil engineer , he never dreamed that he would one day be the editor of a german-language newspaper . whether the new paper can establish itself as the mouthpiece of the liberal jewish community will depend on whether the two full-time and two part-time writers can meet the demand for quality copy .
if they do , the paper hopes to make a significant contribution to the integration of russian-jewish immigrants in germany . igal avidan -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

the former royals hope to raise at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- , but not all family members are happy with the decision . the house of hanover - also known as the welfen - is one grandest and oldest royal families of europe .

the controversial head of the family , prince ernst august , has gained notoriety for his fist fights with the paparazzi and frequent court appearances . now the prince , who is the third husband of princess caroline of monacco , has allowed his two sons to sell most of the family 's art collection so they can set up a fund to maintain the 130-room family castle - marienburg . hundreds of potential buyers , collectors and aristocrats have made the trip to the welfen headquarters for the auction , which runs until oct.15. great results the prince 's cultural advisor , christoph von douglas , said the opening days of the auction have been a great success . bildunterschrift : suits of armor up for sale at marienburg castle " the money brought in by the auction so far is almost three times our conservative estimate , and double what we 'd hoped , " he said .

some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .
i think i 'll just put it on my desk and open letters with it - why not ? " selli n g out ? but not everyone is happy with the auction .
the prince 's own brother , heinrich von hannover , has been a vocal critic of ernst august 's decision to sell off the family silver . " he needs to understand that he 's lost his standing in the family because he 's selling off our cultural heritage - or at least part of it , " heinrich said .
" what i 'm criticizing is that my family has in fact lost power through this .
i would n't say it 's caused a rift within the family , but the whole thing certainly is regrettable . " bildunterschrift : marienburg castle will be opened to visitors . but prince ernst august stands by his decision .

the former royals hope to raise at least 12 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- , but not all family members are happy with the decision . the house of hanover - also known as the welfen - is one grandest and oldest royal families of europe .
it has spawned many english kings and is famous for having built most of its wealth through marriage rather than through war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prince ernst august of hanover but the family 's peaceful image has n't fared quite so well in recent years .
the controversial head of the family , prince ernst august , has gained notoriety for his fist fights with the paparazzi and frequent court appearances . now the prince , who is the third husband of princess caroline of monacco , has allowed his two sons to sell most of the family 's art collection so they can set up a fund to maintain the 130-room family castle - marienburg . hundreds of potential buyers , collectors and aristocrats have made the trip to the welfen headquarters for the auction , which runs until oct.15. great results the prince 's cultural advisor , christoph von douglas , said the opening days of the auction have been a great success . bildunterschrift : suits of armor up for sale at marienburg castle " the money brought in by the auction so far is almost three times our conservative estimate , and double what we 'd hoped , " he said .
" we never thought we 'd do this well , especially with some of these more ' difficult ' portraits and these antique weapons , which can be difficult to sell these days .
the result is just great . " twenty thousand items - from oil paintings to armor - are destined to go home with the highest bidders in what experts say could be the last royal auction europe will ever see . with up to 40 items changing hands each hour , sotheby 's auctioneer patrick von mares said he has his work cut out for him . " we 've received bids from all around the world , " he said .
" i saw that every telephone operator was actively bidding - it was quite a spectacle .
it was great to see how someone would bid 15,000 and the next would hit straight back with 18,000 , then 20,000 .
it was a wonderful atmosphere . " irresistible bargai n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this vest of former english king george iv may have attracted royal bidders .
von mares added that most of the bidders in the gallery are art dealers or private buyers , while most of the bidders manning the 100 phone lines are representatives of various royal families . but the auction has attracted a number of curious onlookers , too .
some of them , like dirk stefanski , could n't resist getting involved in the bidding . " this is the only item that went for a bargain today , " he said .
" i did n't really want to buy anything - i just wanted to come and have a look , but then i saw this - a 500-year-old dagger going for less than the list price .
i think i 'll just put it on my desk and open letters with it - why not ? " selli n g out ? but not everyone is happy with the auction .
the prince 's own brother , heinrich von hannover , has been a vocal critic of ernst august 's decision to sell off the family silver . " he needs to understand that he 's lost his standing in the family because he 's selling off our cultural heritage - or at least part of it , " heinrich said .
" what i 'm criticizing is that my family has in fact lost power through this .
i would n't say it 's caused a rift within the family , but the whole thing certainly is regrettable . " bildunterschrift : marienburg castle will be opened to visitors . but prince ernst august stands by his decision .

with the disaster zone spreading through pakistan and parts of india and afghanistan , the death toll is expected to spiral even higher as the relief efforts get underway .
as many as 30,000 people are estimated to have been killed in pakistani-controlled kashmir alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistani soldiers rescue victims from kashmir a day after the disaster , pakistan president general pervez musharraf appealed to the international community to assist with disaster relief , the country 's state-run news agency reported .
musharraf was quoted as saying pakistan required medicine , tents , cargo helicopters and financial assistance to help survivors .
" we do seek international assistance , we have enough manpower but we need financial support so that we may … cope with the tragedy . "
he said supplies were needed " to reach out to the people in far-flung and cut-off areas " . swift global response around the globe , countries responded swiftly to the disaster , with letters of condolence and offers of humanitarian and financial help pouring in . us president george w. bush , whose country is still coping with the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita , said help was on the way to the victims of what he referred to as a " horrible tragedy . "
other international leaders expressed shock and sadness . un secretary general kofi annan said he was " deeply saddened by the loss of life and destruction " caused by the earthquake .

several british search and resuce teams were expected to be sent . in berlin , foreign minister joschka fischer said germany had immediately released 50,000 euros to be made available to pakistani authorities through berlin 's embassy in islamabad .
humanitarian organizations have already begun calling for donations , and the german government is working closely with groups such as the red cross to organize relief efforts in the disaster zone . rescue teams en route turkey , a frequent victim of deadly earthquakes , offered aid to fellow muslim country pakistan , anatolia news agency reported , quoting foreign minister abdullah gul .

the united nations has also pledged $ 100,000 in immediate emergency funding to finance relief efforts in pakistan . remote areas in greatest need relief organizations have appealed for more assistance to be directed towards the remote provinces in pakistan and kashmir , many of which are cut off from the country 's infrastructure .
up until now it was not clear how bad these far-flung regions had been impacted by the quake . the german aid organization misereor announced from its headquarters in aachen that it had approved immediate assistance of 50,000 euros for rural regions , where entire towns have been decimated by giant mud slides . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe offers help to asian quake victims germany and other european countries responded swiftly to saturday 's massive earthquake which hit pakistan , india and afghanistan , offering aid and funds as well as condolences .

" the impossible has been achieved , " said stanford university 's sebastian thrun after its customised volkswagen , stanley , crossed first on saturday .
twenty-three self-driving racers took part in the grand challenge race which offered a $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.1m -rrb- prize .
vehicles had to negotiate 240km of rocky terrain .
last year none finished .
the challenging competition was run by the us defense advanced research projects agency -lrb- darpa -rrb- .
scientists ' hope the vehicles , guided by sophisticated software , gave scientists hope that robots may one day take part in battles without endangering soldiers .
the driverless vehicles ranged from souped-up suvs -lrb- sports utility vehicles -rrb- to hi-tech dune buggies .
also finishing was a converted red hummer called h1ghlander and a humvee named sandstorm from carnegie mellon university .
" i 'm on top of the world , " said carnegie mellon 's robotics professor william ' red ' whittaker , adding that a mechanical glitch allowed stanley to pass h1ghlander .
the race favourite , a ford escape hybrid by students in metarie , louisiana , came in fourth .
the race was organised by the pentagon 's defence agency to push research into autonomous vehicles for the us military .
this year it doubled the prize fund for the challenge . "
it 's a no-brainer that 50 to 60 years from now , cars will drive themselves " sebastian thrun , stanford university driverless vehicles that can withstand such punishing conditions could be used to carry crucial supplies for the military in war zones .
the vehicles were kitted out and modified with gps -lrb- global positioning satellite -rrb- , cameras , infrared sensors , computing equipment , and lasers to guide them across the tough terrain .
they were not allowed to be controlled , even remotely , by humans .
" we can now see a future where these vehicles will take the place of soldiers in harm 's way , " said ron kurjanowicz , manager of the darpa grand challenge race .
stanford university students hoisted their team captain mr thrun on top of their shoulders after their win .
earlier , mr thrun said he was confident this year 's race would produce a winner and about the future for autonomous vehicles .
" it 's a no-brainer that 50 to 60 years from now , cars will drive themselves , " he said .
tough heats the 23 finalists were chosen after eight days of qualifying events over much shorter courses .
forty-three teams battled it out to take a place in the final , including teams from inventors , universities and a high school .
they were among 195 teams that originally applied to take part in the gruelling cross-country challenge .
the 23 final entrants had 10 hours to complete the race , which included a human-made obstacle course .
but the precise route was kept secret until two hours before the competition .
the teams had varying levels of sponsorship to develop their desert robots .
some had millions pumped into the projects from corporate sponsorship , while others scraped together much less funding .

david davies , the conservative am and mp for monmouth , wants to avoid being accused of racism when criticising travellers who break the law .
he is being referred to the welsh assembly 's standards committee for a possible breach of the ams ' code of conduct .
mr davies said there should be no reason why he could not air his views .
plaid cymru am helen mary jones has claimed mr davies breached the statutory duty to promote equality of opportunity and good community relations .
speaking on bbc wales ' the politics show on sunday , she accused mr davies of giving " support and comfort to people who behave appallingly towards gypsies and travellers " .
mr davies has said in the past there were " lots of law-abiding gypsy travellers " .
but , he added , there were " a significant number " whose behaviour fell " significantly below the accepted norm " .
he has been criticised for his statement , but he maintained there should be no reason why he should not be able to make such a comment .
" if i am dragged before the standards committee to answer a completely false accusation that i 've got something against gypsy travellers , i am going to register as one myself , " he said .
" government advice says you can identify yourself as any ethnic or cultural group you like .
' distasteful ' comments " i would then be well within my rights to say that i 'm a gypsy traveller .
i could n't possibly be accused of racism because i would be myself . "
if found guilty of a breach of standards , mr davies could be suspended from the assembly .
both nick bourne , the conservatives ' leader in the assembly , and david maclean , the conservative chief whip at westminster , have refused to comment on the row .
the row surrounding mr davies began last month after he criticised a £ 48,000 lottery award for a project for schools in hampshire on gypsy and travelling communities .
he wrote to the heritage lottery fund asking for the same amount of money to make a film about the " settled community " .
the fund had given a grant to hampshire council for a project on the traditions of travelling communities .
a spokesman for the gypsy council said at the time that mr davies ' comments were " distasteful " .
