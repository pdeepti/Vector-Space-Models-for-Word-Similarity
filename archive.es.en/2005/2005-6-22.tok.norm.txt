gam , which belongs to swiss banking giant ubs , holds about 1.5 million hvb shares .
but fund manager john bennett told the business daily handelsblatt that gam believed unicredit 's bid price was too low .
the italian giant is offering five of its own shares for every hvb share held , effectively pricing hvb shares at 22 euros -lrb- $ 26.60 -rrb- a piece .
but bennett said the hvb shares were worth 25-27 euros each .
" we 're not going to sell under current conditions , " the fund manager told the newspaper .
gam is not the first hvb shareholder to criticize the terms of the offer .
austrian shareholder , the avz foundation , which holds a stake of four percent , was also critical , saying it would make a final decision whether to accept the offer in september .
nevertheless , most analysts believe shareholder resistance to the deal will not be strong enough to scupper it altogether . dw-world.de a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .
the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
but it was the five time world champions who took the lead in the tenth minute with a fine moment of artistry from ronaldinho , who escaped kaji 's attentions and ran half the length of the pitch to feed robinho who had brilliantly slipped his marker , the 21-year-old striker angling his shot from the left past yoshikatsu kawaguchi . only kawaguchi 's right post prevented japan going further behind when a kaka rocket ricocheted off it soon after .
the crossbar at the other end was responsible for denying a header from kaji off mitsuo ogasawura 's free kick as the asian champions ' pace began to nettle the brazilians . japan equalizes then on 27 minutes they got a deserved equalizer with marcos only getting his fingertips to nakamura 's shot after an attack which had its origins in a hidetoshi nakata-taken free kick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
ronaldinho restored brazil 's supremacy when robinho crossed from the left for the barcelona star to slide the ball in from in front of goal in the 32nd minute . the second half was barely born when nakamura had his head in his hands after a point-blank effort saved by marcos - up at the other end only kawaguchi 's bravery kept the ball from going in when the former portsmouth keeper took the full force of juan 's shot in his face . adriano , having an off day , made way for julio baptista with kaka replaced by baptista 's seville teammate renato on the hour mark and shortly after there was another new face on the pitch belonging to the brazilian fan who breached the tight security cordon . he ran up to ronaldinho before jumping into the japan goal 's netting , five security guards in hot pursuit in the third incident of this nature at the 2005 confed cup which will give organizers cause for concern ahead of next year 's world cup . bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equalizer . japan had the last word when oguro repeated his feat against greece and scored the late leveller after a beautiful free kick over the wall by nakamura hit the post .
all oguro had to do was sink the rebound . " i 'm pleased with my freekick but disappointed we have n't qualified , " said nakamura , who was named man-of-the-match . soccer gods brazil nearly suffered a massive upset when in the match 's waning seconds , japan nearly scored again .
only a save by keeper marcos kept the world champions from going home early . mexico tops group b mexico will face argentina in the semi-finals of the confederations cup after a 0-0 draw against greece in the other group b match on wednesday .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .

sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .

but its determined performance seems to have finally silenced the sceptics . the german media was in a more positive mood on wednesday as it reflected on germany 's 2-2 draw with argentina in the confederations cup match .
the draw sees germany reach the semi-finals as winner of group a , with argentina also qualifying for the last four as runner-up .

gerald asamoah restored germany 's lead in the 51st minute and argentina 's esteban cambiasso leveled with a superb shot . german captain michael ballack was rested for the match with germany already having qualified for the semi-final .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 voting outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans vote big or small come polling day ?
as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .
and if they 're seeking ballot box representation all over the country , they need a total of 28,000 signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the law and order party save germany ?
it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .
we only have a twelfth of the time to collect them , which makes it very difficult for smaller parties , " wagner said . cautious targets although some minor parties , such as the christian pbc , set the bar high with an outspoken aim to make it into the bundestag , gaining enough momentum to jump the five percent hurdle is not what motivates every party to run in the federal elections . " our aim is quite different .
we are hoping to get 0.5 percent of the vote in order to recover some of our election campaign costs so we have the financial basis to run as a conservative-liberal party in the 2009 elections , " wagner said . reaching this modest , more realistic target is not without implications for small parties , which receive 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 0.84 -rrb- for each vote they win .
the money , which is paid out in installments between one federal election and another , can make a huge difference to poor parties . hildegard stöber of the pbc , who believes that what germany really needs is a christian government , says a little more money would go a long way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pbc want to see germany run by the rules of the holy book " we need people to run our election campaign , we need posters .
many small parties fail simply because they do n't have enough money .
our members are volunteers who have to fit the work in around their paid jobs .
if we had more money , we could pay people to do more , " she said . spreading the political gospel although it is highly unlikely that germany will ever embrace the idea of a theocracy , stöber 's complaint is echoed through the ranks of many minor parties across the country . jörg chemnitz of the violets party , which campaigns on an environmental , humanistic and spiritual platform , would be equally grateful for a bit of loose change , but he 's not banking on it coming his way . " we 'd love to recover some of our costs , but we are neither dreamers nor illusionists , and we know it wo n't happen .
what we are getting from the excitement of this early ballot is much more attention , our ideas are being spread , " he said . bildunterschrift : protecting nature is just one of the violets ' priorities and both he and stöber claim that this time round , they have noticed a heightened interest - particularly among younger members of the electorate - in what marginal parties have to offer over the hollow promises of the big contenders . " i see that people who once belonged to more established parties are now drifting towards us .
they are beginning to notice that there is not much difference in the policies of the conservatives and liberals versus those of the social democrats and the greens , " chemnitz said . but if research by the infratest election research institute is anything to go on , there is a body of evidence to suggest that when push comes to shove , voters are not prepared to go that extra mile and put their trust in an unknown quantity .
it 's a case of sticking to one of the few devils they already know so well . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poll puts merkel ahead of schröder german opposition leader angela merkel has moved ahead of chancellor gerhard schröder in opinion polls for the first time with a general election expected in september , a new poll showed on friday .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 voting outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans vote big or small come polling day ?
as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .
and if they 're seeking ballot box representation all over the country , they need a total of 28,000 signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the law and order party save germany ?
it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .
we only have a twelfth of the time to collect them , which makes it very difficult for smaller parties , " wagner said . cautious targets although some minor parties , such as the christian pbc , set the bar high with an outspoken aim to make it into the bundestag , gaining enough momentum to jump the five percent hurdle is not what motivates every party to run in the federal elections . " our aim is quite different .
we are hoping to get 0.5 percent of the vote in order to recover some of our election campaign costs so we have the financial basis to run as a conservative-liberal party in the 2009 elections , " wagner said . reaching this modest , more realistic target is not without implications for small parties , which receive 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 0.84 -rrb- for each vote they win .
the money , which is paid out in installments between one federal election and another , can make a huge difference to poor parties . hildegard stöber of the pbc , who believes that what germany really needs is a christian government , says a little more money would go a long way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pbc want to see germany run by the rules of the holy book " we need people to run our election campaign , we need posters .

" we 'd love to recover some of our costs , but we are neither dreamers nor illusionists , and we know it wo n't happen .
what we are getting from the excitement of this early ballot is much more attention , our ideas are being spread , " he said . bildunterschrift : protecting nature is just one of the violets ' priorities and both he and stöber claim that this time round , they have noticed a heightened interest - particularly among younger members of the electorate - in what marginal parties have to offer over the hollow promises of the big contenders . " i see that people who once belonged to more established parties are now drifting towards us .
they are beginning to notice that there is not much difference in the policies of the conservatives and liberals versus those of the social democrats and the greens , " chemnitz said . but if research by the infratest election research institute is anything to go on , there is a body of evidence to suggest that when push comes to shove , voters are not prepared to go that extra mile and put their trust in an unknown quantity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 22.06.2005 brazil , japan clash in crunch decider großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian champion japan is on a roll after defeating greece wednesday 's final confed cup group b matches will see a vanquished greece facing buoyant mexico for a largely ceremonial duel .
but the real action will be in cologne as japan battles brazil for a spot in the semi-finals . suspense has been building in the rundown to wednesday 's crunch confederations cup group b decider between asian champions japan and world cup holders brazil amid growing speculation about possible shuffles in brazil 's team lineup . fresh off a victory against greece , the japanese team appeared visibly more relaxed than its brazilian counterparts during a training session in leverkusen on monday .
humiliated by mexico by a single goal , brazil is under pressure to win - though even a draw would do - against japan on wednesday in order to advance through to the semi-finals on sunday of the eight-nation tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira on tuesday , brazil coach carlos alberto parreira was playing his cards close to his chest though he 'd hinted earlier that he 'd be making sweeping changes for the crucial match that will determine whether it is the world or asian champions who join mexico , germany and argentina in the semi-finals . " i 'll be making changes , but perhaps not as many as you think , " parreira said playfully .
" normally , i 'd give the team -lsb- lineup -rsb- but for special reasons this time i 'm going to wait . " brazilian media was rife with rumors this week about major swaps in the team 's defense .
parreira confirmed monday that he wanted to change his defense , with marcos likely to come in for dida as goalkeeper and leo and maicon replacing cicinho and gilberto .
he may also break up the so-called " fantastic quartet " of robinho , ronaldinho , adriano and kaka . bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano , left , and ronaldinho , right , congratulate robinho parreira insisted that even a defeat by japan would not cost him his job .
" if that happens , no one 's going to get fired .
our aim is to prepare the team for the world cup next year , but of course if we have the opportunity to win here we will take it . " japan raring to go meanwhile brazilian-born japan coach zico said he was keeping his team unchanged for the decider against brazil .
japan must beat world cup holders brazil if it is to progress to the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico the former brazilian national soccer star said he was keeping faith in keiji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa - his two strikers who failed to shine against greece - for wednesday 's decider against brazil . " just because they missed goal-scoring opportunities it does n't mean they were playing bad soccer , " zico said .
" tamada and yanagisawa created a lot of chances and opened up the middle to offer opportunities to the midfielders to come along and score too . " the japan coach believes his asian champions can upset his fellow countrymen and follow group b leaders mexico through to the semi-finals . " if we play as we played against greece our chances are good , " zico said .
" we know the brazilian players .
we know everything about the opposition .
we respect the power of brazil but we have to fight for our result and do everything we can to win . " a noticeable characteristic of japan 's training sessions is the enthusiastic atmosphere in which they 're held , a spirit zico said he had deliberately tried to foster since he took over as coach after the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : japanese soccer team supporters " that 's the way we operate .
we have to take pleasure from soccer as a group and that spirit comes through in a match , " he said .
" we play with a lot of joy . "
though japan 's recent record against brazil does not make happy reading , zico said that the past is the past .
in addition , the japanese can also look forward to a visit from japanese princess takamado during their duel against brazil . zico , who will be confronting his fellow countrymen for the first time on wednesday as japan 's coach , also said he would be singing brazil 's national anthem . " i 've been singing it before i went to school .
it 's part of my life .
i will sing it with joy and happiness , but afterwards i will be working for japan . " greece playing for pride in contrast , the second match in the group b final between greece and mexico in frankfurt on wednesday lacks much of a punch .
european champion greece is merely playing for pride since it has already been eliminated from the tournament after they went down to brazil -lrb- 3-0 -rrb- and japan -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto rehhagel greece has been on a downward spiral since euro 2004 and their german coach " king otto " rehhagel has seen the red carpet swept from under his feet . " i really thought my team would have played better in this tournament , " rehhagel said on tuesday .
after a dreadful tournament , rehhagel has switched his focus to some vital qualifying matches for the 2006 world cup . " we have to get used to winning " while greek fans are ready to go home , mexican supporters are on a high .
mexico produced the biggest shock of the confederations cup by defeating world champions brazil 1-0 in their last group match and the team has already secured a place in the semi-finals on sunday with a maximum six points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's ricardo osorio , left , heads the ball away from brazil 's robinho " it 's satisfying to see how we 're growing and able to beat great teams .
we 're getting better all the time , " mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said . mexico is also dreaming of a repeat of its 1999 success in the competition .
that year mexico also defeated brazil , winning the final 4-3 in front of home fans .
a point against greece on wednesday would secure top spot in group b. " we have to get used to winning , make it a habit , " lavolpe said .
" to beat the champions of the world gives us great confidence in our own ability .

" the japan coach believes his asian champions can upset his fellow countrymen and follow group b leaders mexico through to the semi-finals . " if we play as we played against greece our chances are good , " zico said .
" we know the brazilian players .
we know everything about the opposition .
we respect the power of brazil but we have to fight for our result and do everything we can to win . " a noticeable characteristic of japan 's training sessions is the enthusiastic atmosphere in which they 're held , a spirit zico said he had deliberately tried to foster since he took over as coach after the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : japanese soccer team supporters " that 's the way we operate .
we have to take pleasure from soccer as a group and that spirit comes through in a match , " he said .
" we play with a lot of joy . "
though japan 's recent record against brazil does not make happy reading , zico said that the past is the past .
in addition , the japanese can also look forward to a visit from japanese princess takamado during their duel against brazil . zico , who will be confronting his fellow countrymen for the first time on wednesday as japan 's coach , also said he would be singing brazil 's national anthem . " i 've been singing it before i went to school .
it 's part of my life .
i will sing it with joy and happiness , but afterwards i will be working for japan . " greece playing for pride in contrast , the second match in the group b final between greece and mexico in frankfurt on wednesday lacks much of a punch .

after a dreadful tournament , rehhagel has switched his focus to some vital qualifying matches for the 2006 world cup . " we have to get used to winning " while greek fans are ready to go home , mexican supporters are on a high .
mexico produced the biggest shock of the confederations cup by defeating world champions brazil 1-0 in their last group match and the team has already secured a place in the semi-finals on sunday with a maximum six points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's ricardo osorio , left , heads the ball away from brazil 's robinho " it 's satisfying to see how we 're growing and able to beat great teams .
we 're getting better all the time , " mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said . mexico is also dreaming of a repeat of its 1999 success in the competition .
that year mexico also defeated brazil , winning the final 4-3 in front of home fans .
a point against greece on wednesday would secure top spot in group b. " we have to get used to winning , make it a habit , " lavolpe said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 immigration concerns unfounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is immigration really a cause for concern in western countries ?
concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration .

" the eu spends two euros a day per cow , " britain 's new minister for european affairs , douglas alexander , recently summed up the situation . these subsidies were one of the main reasons why negotiations over the eu budget failed at the june 16 -17 summit , plunging the 25-nation body into its worst crisis so far . france especially opposed a reduction as britain was unwilling to give up a decade-old rebate is receives as the country does not profit as much from the agricultural subsidies as other states .
it means that the union will continue to spend 10 times more money on agriculture than it does on education and research . two billion for olive oil the list of the eu 's support for agriculture includes financial help for investments , funds for young farmers and payments to farmers who go into early retirement .
the bloc subsidizes new farms in areas where few exist and supports efforts to improve the processing and marketing of agricultural products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olive tree plantation , near alquera , portugal one important segment is the funding of specific products .
a german farmer receives money for exporting eggs while a spanish winegrower gets eu euros for his work .

" the eu spends two euros a day per cow , " britain 's new minister for european affairs , douglas alexander , recently summed up the situation . these subsidies were one of the main reasons why negotiations over the eu budget failed at the june 16 -17 summit , plunging the 25-nation body into its worst crisis so far . france especially opposed a reduction as britain was unwilling to give up a decade-old rebate is receives as the country does not profit as much from the agricultural subsidies as other states .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .

as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .

it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .
we only have a twelfth of the time to collect them , which makes it very difficult for smaller parties , " wagner said . cautious targets although some minor parties , such as the christian pbc , set the bar high with an outspoken aim to make it into the bundestag , gaining enough momentum to jump the five percent hurdle is not what motivates every party to run in the federal elections . " our aim is quite different .
we are hoping to get 0.5 percent of the vote in order to recover some of our election campaign costs so we have the financial basis to run as a conservative-liberal party in the 2009 elections , " wagner said . reaching this modest , more realistic target is not without implications for small parties , which receive 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 0.84 -rrb- for each vote they win .
the money , which is paid out in installments between one federal election and another , can make a huge difference to poor parties . hildegard stöber of the pbc , who believes that what germany really needs is a christian government , says a little more money would go a long way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pbc want to see germany run by the rules of the holy book " we need people to run our election campaign , we need posters .
many small parties fail simply because they do n't have enough money .
our members are volunteers who have to fit the work in around their paid jobs .
if we had more money , we could pay people to do more , " she said . spreading the political gospel although it is highly unlikely that germany will ever embrace the idea of a theocracy , stöber 's complaint is echoed through the ranks of many minor parties across the country . jörg chemnitz of the violets party , which campaigns on an environmental , humanistic and spiritual platform , would be equally grateful for a bit of loose change , but he 's not banking on it coming his way . " we 'd love to recover some of our costs , but we are neither dreamers nor illusionists , and we know it wo n't happen .
what we are getting from the excitement of this early ballot is much more attention , our ideas are being spread , " he said . bildunterschrift : protecting nature is just one of the violets ' priorities and both he and stöber claim that this time round , they have noticed a heightened interest - particularly among younger members of the electorate - in what marginal parties have to offer over the hollow promises of the big contenders .

they are beginning to notice that there is not much difference in the policies of the conservatives and liberals versus those of the social democrats and the greens , " chemnitz said . but if research by the infratest election research institute is anything to go on , there is a body of evidence to suggest that when push comes to shove , voters are not prepared to go that extra mile and put their trust in an unknown quantity .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

but , the country still lags far behind other eu countries when it comes to dealing with the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.06.2005 the eu 's agricultural dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these german farmers want more money for her milk while german farmers protest against dumping prices for their products during their current annual meeting , others call for a reduction of eu agricultural subsidies that make up the largest part of the bloc 's budget . brussels currently spends more than 45 billion euros -lrb- $ 54.1 billion -rrb- on agriculture with the biggest chunk reserved for subsidies that go to the union 's 11 million farmers . " the eu spends two euros a day per cow , " britain 's new minister for european affairs , douglas alexander , recently summed up the situation . these subsidies were one of the main reasons why negotiations over the eu budget failed at the june 16 -17 summit , plunging the 25-nation body into its worst crisis so far . france especially opposed a reduction as britain was unwilling to give up a decade-old rebate is receives as the country does not profit as much from the agricultural subsidies as other states .
it means that the union will continue to spend 10 times more money on agriculture than it does on education and research . two billion for olive oil the list of the eu 's support for agriculture includes financial help for investments , funds for young farmers and payments to farmers who go into early retirement .
the bloc subsidizes new farms in areas where few exist and supports efforts to improve the processing and marketing of agricultural products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olive tree plantation , near alquera , portugal one important segment is the funding of specific products .
a german farmer receives money for exporting eggs while a spanish winegrower gets eu euros for his work .
grain subsidies make up the biggest portion with 11 billion euros while two billion euros are spent on aiding the production of olive oil . in 2003 , the distribution of aid changed profoundly as eu leaders did away with a system that remunerated farmers according to the amount they produced . " this was meant to get farmers to adjust their production levels to market demands , " said monika hartmann of the institute for agricultural policies in bonn . now , special requirements can be attached to payments . " cross-compliance makes it possible to check that farmers adhere to fertilization and labeling rules , " said udo hemmerling , an expert on economic policies at the german farmers ' association . some checks are in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers meanwhile are not in direct contact with brussels at any time .
subsidies are distributed by local governments - in germany , that responsibility lies with the 16 states . all member states also have control systems in place to prevent abuse .
according to hemmerling , agencies check 5 percent of farms each year .
he added that as a result of the checks , reclaims can amount to hundreds of millions of euros in some member states . a global problem the reason why only few politicians are willing to criticize the subsidies has to do with national interests .
while france heads the lists of subsidy backers , germany 's agriculture also could not survive without the help .
in bad years , german farmers barely manage to make enough money to cover their costs - a problem that 's largely caused by price dumping in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international comparisons show that few countries can manage without agricultural subsidies .
switzerland , japan and the us all protect their own farmers , making it even harder to scale back subsidies . that 's why researchers and farmer representatives see a multilateral approach as the only way to change things in the long run . daniel wortmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de quo vadis , europe ?

susanne maier , a therapist and german herself , admits as much . " we germans are n't very easygoing and loose , " she told der spiegel magazine .
" we 've got to laugh before we make ourselves sick . " to ward off any collective despair-fueled illness -lrb- which some might say has already struck -rrb- , maier has opened berlin 's first school to actually teach germans to laugh , since the jolly gene for that appears to have mutated out of the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' international laughing club ' members gesture and laugh as they celebrate world laughers day in bangalore , india , on may 2 , 2004 .
the laughing club was founded in 1995 by madan kataria with the belief that laughing fits boost the immune system .
it 's not a new idea .
maier took it from india , where 10 years ago a doctor , madan kataria , developed laughter yoga .
it was meant to relieve stress and improve participants ' quality of life . it 's okay to be silly in the school in a northern district of the capital , participants do very un-german things .
they run around the classroom without any purpose ; they clap their hands , saying ho-ho-ho and ha-ha-ha ; and they actually look each other in the eye , something few sane people would attempt on berlin 's own mean streets . " fake it until you make it , " is maier 's motto and her students of laughter have to pretend to crack up until the real thing comes along . she admits that it all appears very german , this need to train germans to do something that comes naturally to most people , but it does n't bother her . bildunterschrift : they seem to be doing pretty well already " if germans can only learn to laugh through a kind of formal methodology , we 'll go ahead and use it , " she said . there 's a good chance maier will be successful : after all , following orders - unlike laughing - is n't something germans seem to have a problem with . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ?
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- germans have the last laugh could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue .
-lrb- oct .
15 , 2004 -rrb- the best of " from the fringe " we 've gathered a selection of our " and finally ... " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .

but the real action will be in cologne as japan battles brazil for a spot in the semi-finals . suspense has been building in the rundown to wednesday 's crunch confederations cup group b decider between asian champions japan and world cup holders brazil amid growing speculation about possible shuffles in brazil 's team lineup . fresh off a victory against greece , the japanese team appeared visibly more relaxed than its brazilian counterparts during a training session in leverkusen on monday .
humiliated by mexico by a single goal , brazil is under pressure to win - though even a draw would do - against japan on wednesday in order to advance through to the semi-finals on sunday of the eight-nation tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira on tuesday , brazil coach carlos alberto parreira was playing his cards close to his chest though he 'd hinted earlier that he 'd be making sweeping changes for the crucial match that will determine whether it is the world or asian champions who join mexico , germany and argentina in the semi-finals . " i 'll be making changes , but perhaps not as many as you think , " parreira said playfully .
" normally , i 'd give the team -lsb- lineup -rsb- but for special reasons this time i 'm going to wait . " brazilian media was rife with rumors this week about major swaps in the team 's defense .
parreira confirmed monday that he wanted to change his defense , with marcos likely to come in for dida as goalkeeper and leo and maicon replacing cicinho and gilberto .
he may also break up the so-called " fantastic quartet " of robinho , ronaldinho , adriano and kaka . bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano , left , and ronaldinho , right , congratulate robinho parreira insisted that even a defeat by japan would not cost him his job .

" just because they missed goal-scoring opportunities it does n't mean they were playing bad soccer , " zico said .
" tamada and yanagisawa created a lot of chances and opened up the middle to offer opportunities to the midfielders to come along and score too . " the japan coach believes his asian champions can upset his fellow countrymen and follow group b leaders mexico through to the semi-finals . " if we play as we played against greece our chances are good , " zico said .
" we know the brazilian players .
we know everything about the opposition .
we respect the power of brazil but we have to fight for our result and do everything we can to win . " a noticeable characteristic of japan 's training sessions is the enthusiastic atmosphere in which they 're held , a spirit zico said he had deliberately tried to foster since he took over as coach after the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : japanese soccer team supporters " that 's the way we operate .
we have to take pleasure from soccer as a group and that spirit comes through in a match , " he said .
" we play with a lot of joy . "
though japan 's recent record against brazil does not make happy reading , zico said that the past is the past .
in addition , the japanese can also look forward to a visit from japanese princess takamado during their duel against brazil . zico , who will be confronting his fellow countrymen for the first time on wednesday as japan 's coach , also said he would be singing brazil 's national anthem . " i 've been singing it before i went to school .
it 's part of my life .
i will sing it with joy and happiness , but afterwards i will be working for japan . " greece playing for pride in contrast , the second match in the group b final between greece and mexico in frankfurt on wednesday lacks much of a punch .

after a dreadful tournament , rehhagel has switched his focus to some vital qualifying matches for the 2006 world cup . " we have to get used to winning " while greek fans are ready to go home , mexican supporters are on a high .

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .
also , a " global village " is being built south of cologne which will demonstrate renewable energy use .
and finally , there will be discussions and lectures about the environment and conservation , so that pilgrims can take a little environmental friendliness home with them . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal visit to germany confirmed its official : the vatican has announced that pope benedict xvi will visit the city of cologne on the occasion of world youth day this august .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
but it was the five time world champions who took the lead in the tenth minute with a fine moment of artistry from ronaldinho , who escaped kaji 's attentions and ran half the length of the pitch to feed robinho who had brilliantly slipped his marker , the 21-year-old striker angling his shot from the left past yoshikatsu kawaguchi . only kawaguchi 's right post prevented japan going further behind when a kaka rocket ricocheted off it soon after .
the crossbar at the other end was responsible for denying a header from kaji off mitsuo ogasawura 's free kick as the asian champions ' pace began to nettle the brazilians . japan equalizes then on 27 minutes they got a deserved equalizer with marcos only getting his fingertips to nakamura 's shot after an attack which had its origins in a hidetoshi nakata-taken free kick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
ronaldinho restored brazil 's supremacy when robinho crossed from the left for the barcelona star to slide the ball in from in front of goal in the 32nd minute . the second half was barely born when nakamura had his head in his hands after a point-blank effort saved by marcos - up at the other end only kawaguchi 's bravery kept the ball from going in when the former portsmouth keeper took the full force of juan 's shot in his face . adriano , having an off day , made way for julio baptista with kaka replaced by baptista 's seville teammate renato on the hour mark and shortly after there was another new face on the pitch belonging to the brazilian fan who breached the tight security cordon . he ran up to ronaldinho before jumping into the japan goal 's netting , five security guards in hot pursuit in the third incident of this nature at the 2005 confed cup which will give organizers cause for concern ahead of next year 's world cup . bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equalizer . japan had the last word when oguro repeated his feat against greece and scored the late leveller after a beautiful free kick over the wall by nakamura hit the post .
all oguro had to do was sink the rebound . " i 'm pleased with my freekick but disappointed we have n't qualified , " said nakamura , who was named man-of-the-match . soccer gods brazil nearly suffered a massive upset when in the match 's waning seconds , japan nearly scored again .
only a save by keeper marcos kept the world champions from going home early . mexico tops group b mexico will face argentina in the semi-finals of the confederations cup after a 0-0 draw against greece in the other group b match on wednesday .
the scoreless draw , the first of the tournament so far , helps mexico stretch their unbeaten run to 21 games . mexico won the competition in their homeland back in 1999 and if they can continue their unbeaten run for two more games the trophy will be theirs again . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sways critics with resolute play confederations cup host germany is n't resting on its laurels after its 2-2 draw against soccer heavyweight argentina on tuesday .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .

sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .
" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july . " weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .
he is the last surviving member of the 274th germany infantry regiment that carried out the massacre . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi massacre trial reopens old wounds a prosecutor on thursday demanded life imprisonment for 10 former nazi german soldiers , now in their 80s , who are on trial for the wartime nazi massacre of 560 civilians in an italian mountain village .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
but it was the five time world champions who took the lead in the tenth minute with a fine moment of artistry from ronaldinho , who escaped kaji 's attentions and ran half the length of the pitch to feed robinho who had brilliantly slipped his marker , the 21-year-old striker angling his shot from the left past yoshikatsu kawaguchi . only kawaguchi 's right post prevented japan going further behind when a kaka rocket ricocheted off it soon after .
the crossbar at the other end was responsible for denying a header from kaji off mitsuo ogasawura 's free kick as the asian champions ' pace began to nettle the brazilians . japan equalizes then on 27 minutes they got a deserved equalizer with marcos only getting his fingertips to nakamura 's shot after an attack which had its origins in a hidetoshi nakata-taken free kick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
ronaldinho restored brazil 's supremacy when robinho crossed from the left for the barcelona star to slide the ball in from in front of goal in the 32nd minute . the second half was barely born when nakamura had his head in his hands after a point-blank effort saved by marcos - up at the other end only kawaguchi 's bravery kept the ball from going in when the former portsmouth keeper took the full force of juan 's shot in his face . adriano , having an off day , made way for julio baptista with kaka replaced by baptista 's seville teammate renato on the hour mark and shortly after there was another new face on the pitch belonging to the brazilian fan who breached the tight security cordon . he ran up to ronaldinho before jumping into the japan goal 's netting , five security guards in hot pursuit in the third incident of this nature at the 2005 confed cup which will give organizers cause for concern ahead of next year 's world cup . bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equalizer . japan had the last word when oguro repeated his feat against greece and scored the late leveller after a beautiful free kick over the wall by nakamura hit the post .
all oguro had to do was sink the rebound . " i 'm pleased with my freekick but disappointed we have n't qualified , " said nakamura , who was named man-of-the-match . soccer gods brazil nearly suffered a massive upset when in the match 's waning seconds , japan nearly scored again .
only a save by keeper marcos kept the world champions from going home early . mexico tops group b mexico will face argentina in the semi-finals of the confederations cup after a 0-0 draw against greece in the other group b match on wednesday .

but the real action will be in cologne as japan battles brazil for a spot in the semi-finals . suspense has been building in the rundown to wednesday 's crunch confederations cup group b decider between asian champions japan and world cup holders brazil amid growing speculation about possible shuffles in brazil 's team lineup . fresh off a victory against greece , the japanese team appeared visibly more relaxed than its brazilian counterparts during a training session in leverkusen on monday .
humiliated by mexico by a single goal , brazil is under pressure to win - though even a draw would do - against japan on wednesday in order to advance through to the semi-finals on sunday of the eight-nation tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira on tuesday , brazil coach carlos alberto parreira was playing his cards close to his chest though he 'd hinted earlier that he 'd be making sweeping changes for the crucial match that will determine whether it is the world or asian champions who join mexico , germany and argentina in the semi-finals . " i 'll be making changes , but perhaps not as many as you think , " parreira said playfully .
" normally , i 'd give the team -lsb- lineup -rsb- but for special reasons this time i 'm going to wait . " brazilian media was rife with rumors this week about major swaps in the team 's defense .
parreira confirmed monday that he wanted to change his defense , with marcos likely to come in for dida as goalkeeper and leo and maicon replacing cicinho and gilberto .
he may also break up the so-called " fantastic quartet " of robinho , ronaldinho , adriano and kaka . bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano , left , and ronaldinho , right , congratulate robinho parreira insisted that even a defeat by japan would not cost him his job .
" if that happens , no one 's going to get fired .
our aim is to prepare the team for the world cup next year , but of course if we have the opportunity to win here we will take it . " japan raring to go meanwhile brazilian-born japan coach zico said he was keeping his team unchanged for the decider against brazil .
japan must beat world cup holders brazil if it is to progress to the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico the former brazilian national soccer star said he was keeping faith in keiji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa - his two strikers who failed to shine against greece - for wednesday 's decider against brazil . " just because they missed goal-scoring opportunities it does n't mean they were playing bad soccer , " zico said .
" tamada and yanagisawa created a lot of chances and opened up the middle to offer opportunities to the midfielders to come along and score too . " the japan coach believes his asian champions can upset his fellow countrymen and follow group b leaders mexico through to the semi-finals . " if we play as we played against greece our chances are good , " zico said .
" we know the brazilian players .
we know everything about the opposition .
we respect the power of brazil but we have to fight for our result and do everything we can to win . " a noticeable characteristic of japan 's training sessions is the enthusiastic atmosphere in which they 're held , a spirit zico said he had deliberately tried to foster since he took over as coach after the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : japanese soccer team supporters " that 's the way we operate .
we have to take pleasure from soccer as a group and that spirit comes through in a match , " he said .
" we play with a lot of joy . "
though japan 's recent record against brazil does not make happy reading , zico said that the past is the past .
in addition , the japanese can also look forward to a visit from japanese princess takamado during their duel against brazil . zico , who will be confronting his fellow countrymen for the first time on wednesday as japan 's coach , also said he would be singing brazil 's national anthem . " i 've been singing it before i went to school .
it 's part of my life .
i will sing it with joy and happiness , but afterwards i will be working for japan . " greece playing for pride in contrast , the second match in the group b final between greece and mexico in frankfurt on wednesday lacks much of a punch .
european champion greece is merely playing for pride since it has already been eliminated from the tournament after they went down to brazil -lrb- 3-0 -rrb- and japan -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto rehhagel greece has been on a downward spiral since euro 2004 and their german coach " king otto " rehhagel has seen the red carpet swept from under his feet . " i really thought my team would have played better in this tournament , " rehhagel said on tuesday .
after a dreadful tournament , rehhagel has switched his focus to some vital qualifying matches for the 2006 world cup . " we have to get used to winning " while greek fans are ready to go home , mexican supporters are on a high .
mexico produced the biggest shock of the confederations cup by defeating world champions brazil 1-0 in their last group match and the team has already secured a place in the semi-finals on sunday with a maximum six points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's ricardo osorio , left , heads the ball away from brazil 's robinho " it 's satisfying to see how we 're growing and able to beat great teams .
we 're getting better all the time , " mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said . mexico is also dreaming of a repeat of its 1999 success in the competition .
that year mexico also defeated brazil , winning the final 4-3 in front of home fans .
a point against greece on wednesday would secure top spot in group b. " we have to get used to winning , make it a habit , " lavolpe said .

but the real action will be in cologne as japan battles brazil for a spot in the semi-finals . suspense has been building in the rundown to wednesday 's crunch confederations cup group b decider between asian champions japan and world cup holders brazil amid growing speculation about possible shuffles in brazil 's team lineup . fresh off a victory against greece , the japanese team appeared visibly more relaxed than its brazilian counterparts during a training session in leverkusen on monday .
humiliated by mexico by a single goal , brazil is under pressure to win - though even a draw would do - against japan on wednesday in order to advance through to the semi-finals on sunday of the eight-nation tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira on tuesday , brazil coach carlos alberto parreira was playing his cards close to his chest though he 'd hinted earlier that he 'd be making sweeping changes for the crucial match that will determine whether it is the world or asian champions who join mexico , germany and argentina in the semi-finals . " i 'll be making changes , but perhaps not as many as you think , " parreira said playfully .
" normally , i 'd give the team -lsb- lineup -rsb- but for special reasons this time i 'm going to wait . " brazilian media was rife with rumors this week about major swaps in the team 's defense .
parreira confirmed monday that he wanted to change his defense , with marcos likely to come in for dida as goalkeeper and leo and maicon replacing cicinho and gilberto .
he may also break up the so-called " fantastic quartet " of robinho , ronaldinho , adriano and kaka . bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano , left , and ronaldinho , right , congratulate robinho parreira insisted that even a defeat by japan would not cost him his job .
" if that happens , no one 's going to get fired .
our aim is to prepare the team for the world cup next year , but of course if we have the opportunity to win here we will take it . " japan raring to go meanwhile brazilian-born japan coach zico said he was keeping his team unchanged for the decider against brazil .
japan must beat world cup holders brazil if it is to progress to the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico the former brazilian national soccer star said he was keeping faith in keiji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa - his two strikers who failed to shine against greece - for wednesday 's decider against brazil . " just because they missed goal-scoring opportunities it does n't mean they were playing bad soccer , " zico said .
" tamada and yanagisawa created a lot of chances and opened up the middle to offer opportunities to the midfielders to come along and score too . " the japan coach believes his asian champions can upset his fellow countrymen and follow group b leaders mexico through to the semi-finals . " if we play as we played against greece our chances are good , " zico said .
" we know the brazilian players .
we know everything about the opposition .
we respect the power of brazil but we have to fight for our result and do everything we can to win . " a noticeable characteristic of japan 's training sessions is the enthusiastic atmosphere in which they 're held , a spirit zico said he had deliberately tried to foster since he took over as coach after the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : japanese soccer team supporters " that 's the way we operate .
we have to take pleasure from soccer as a group and that spirit comes through in a match , " he said .
" we play with a lot of joy . "
though japan 's recent record against brazil does not make happy reading , zico said that the past is the past .
in addition , the japanese can also look forward to a visit from japanese princess takamado during their duel against brazil . zico , who will be confronting his fellow countrymen for the first time on wednesday as japan 's coach , also said he would be singing brazil 's national anthem . " i 've been singing it before i went to school .
it 's part of my life .
i will sing it with joy and happiness , but afterwards i will be working for japan . " greece playing for pride in contrast , the second match in the group b final between greece and mexico in frankfurt on wednesday lacks much of a punch .
european champion greece is merely playing for pride since it has already been eliminated from the tournament after they went down to brazil -lrb- 3-0 -rrb- and japan -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto rehhagel greece has been on a downward spiral since euro 2004 and their german coach " king otto " rehhagel has seen the red carpet swept from under his feet . " i really thought my team would have played better in this tournament , " rehhagel said on tuesday .
after a dreadful tournament , rehhagel has switched his focus to some vital qualifying matches for the 2006 world cup . " we have to get used to winning " while greek fans are ready to go home , mexican supporters are on a high .
mexico produced the biggest shock of the confederations cup by defeating world champions brazil 1-0 in their last group match and the team has already secured a place in the semi-finals on sunday with a maximum six points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's ricardo osorio , left , heads the ball away from brazil 's robinho " it 's satisfying to see how we 're growing and able to beat great teams .
we 're getting better all the time , " mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said . mexico is also dreaming of a repeat of its 1999 success in the competition .
that year mexico also defeated brazil , winning the final 4-3 in front of home fans .
a point against greece on wednesday would secure top spot in group b. " we have to get used to winning , make it a habit , " lavolpe said .

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .
also , a " global village " is being built south of cologne which will demonstrate renewable energy use .
and finally , there will be discussions and lectures about the environment and conservation , so that pilgrims can take a little environmental friendliness home with them . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal visit to germany confirmed its official : the vatican has announced that pope benedict xvi will visit the city of cologne on the occasion of world youth day this august .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .
" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july . " weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .
he is the last surviving member of the 274th germany infantry regiment that carried out the massacre . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi massacre trial reopens old wounds a prosecutor on thursday demanded life imprisonment for 10 former nazi german soldiers , now in their 80s , who are on trial for the wartime nazi massacre of 560 civilians in an italian mountain village .

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .
also , a " global village " is being built south of cologne which will demonstrate renewable energy use .
and finally , there will be discussions and lectures about the environment and conservation , so that pilgrims can take a little environmental friendliness home with them . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal visit to germany confirmed its official : the vatican has announced that pope benedict xvi will visit the city of cologne on the occasion of world youth day this august .

but its determined performance seems to have finally silenced the sceptics . the german media was in a more positive mood on wednesday as it reflected on germany 's 2-2 draw with argentina in the confederations cup match .
the draw sees germany reach the semi-finals as winner of group a , with argentina also qualifying for the last four as runner-up . " after the 90 minutes in nuremberg we know we do not need to hide from anyone , " declared mass-circulation daily bild . " we should not fear the favorites for the world cup as argentina crushed brazil 3-1 in the qualifying campaign . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sebastian deisler , left , runs clear of his teammate kevin kuranyi , center , who is held back by argentina 's juan sorin tuesday 's match at the 42,000-strong franken stadium in nuremberg saw brazilian-born german striker kevin kuranyi notch up the first goal in the 29th minute before argentinean midfielder and man of the match juan roman riquelme scored an equalizer with a blistering free kick minutes later .
gerald asamoah restored germany 's lead in the 51st minute and argentina 's esteban cambiasso leveled with a superb shot . german captain michael ballack was rested for the match with germany already having qualified for the semi-final .
but , coach jürgen klinsmann said the move was also aimed at encouraging more players to shoulder responsibility and was an indication that the team was n't too dependant on ballack . " national team shines without -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack , " said the respected frankfurter allgemeine daily . klinsmann , 40 , however insisted that the move did n't endanger the team 's performance .
" it was not a risk to rest ballack as we knew this side could do the job . " germany on a par with soccer heavyweights yet the job was not quite completed and the search for a win against a top nation goes on .
not since the 1-0 win over england in october 2000 has germany defeated a recognized top-ranked team . " germany made to wait for big win , " headlined daily berliner morgenpost .
" but klinsmann 's side can be proud of reaching the semi-finals as group winners after a determined display . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann however klinsmann put a positive spin on tuesday 's result .
" we have n't won against a heavyweight for at least five years but you can also see things differently : since we began in july 2004 -lrb- with klinsmann as coach -rrb- , we have n't lost against the big guns either . " assistant coach joachim löw agreed : " the big guns simply ca n't beat us anymore , " hinting that a year before the next world cup , germany was once again on a par with soccer greats argentina and brazil on its own turf even without captain ballack . even german soccer federation chief gerhard mayer-vorfelder was full of praise .
" one could see that it was possible even without ballack and that makes one a bit prouder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's juan roman riquelme compliments rained in from rivals argentina , too .
coach jose pekerman said germany was difficult to play against while star midfielder riquelme called it a " great team . " still missing that extra touch but despite the bouquets , klinsmann was far from overrating his team 's performance and sober in his assessment of what the team still lacked to go for the kill .
" the last bit of determination and alertness was missing in crucial situations , " he said . perhaps we miss that extra touch of class against the top sides , " admitted midfielder bastian schweinsteiger .
" sometimes we need to use our heads more . " schweinsteiger will miss the semi-final after picking up a yellow card and must hope his team-mates can give him the opportunity to play in the final on june 29 in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , kevin kuranyi and mike hanke world champion brazil is one possible opponent for germany , as are japan and mexico , but klinsmann prefers to face the big guns . " we would prefer to play against a big team in the semi-finals , " insisted klinsmann .
" perhaps brazil in the next round and , if we beat it , argentina again in the final . " mexico leads group b and is the only team to secure a spot in the last four with brazil and japan fighting it out on wednesday for the right to join them . " can we now expect the mighty brazil ? " asked daily bild . in september last year germany drew 1-1 with brazil in berlin but the memory of the 2-0 defeat in the 2002 world cup final in yokohama still lingers . but , for now klinsmann is clear that the team can pat itself on the back for tuesday 's performance . " the team is on its way and the players are allowed to be a little proud of themselves - we are too , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany draws with argentina germany tied 2-2 with argentina on tuesday night , making the hosts the winner of confed cup group a. the result puts both teams through to the next round .

an entrepreneur in berlin wants to change that and wants to educate his countrymen about the joy of laughing . chortling , chuckling , giggling and busting a gut are words not often associated with germans , whose spectrum of facial expressions generally ranges from dour to , if you 're lucky , neutral .
susanne maier , a therapist and german herself , admits as much . " we germans are n't very easygoing and loose , " she told der spiegel magazine .
" we 've got to laugh before we make ourselves sick . " to ward off any collective despair-fueled illness -lrb- which some might say has already struck -rrb- , maier has opened berlin 's first school to actually teach germans to laugh , since the jolly gene for that appears to have mutated out of the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' international laughing club ' members gesture and laugh as they celebrate world laughers day in bangalore , india , on may 2 , 2004 .
the laughing club was founded in 1995 by madan kataria with the belief that laughing fits boost the immune system .
it 's not a new idea .
maier took it from india , where 10 years ago a doctor , madan kataria , developed laughter yoga .
it was meant to relieve stress and improve participants ' quality of life . it 's okay to be silly in the school in a northern district of the capital , participants do very un-german things .
they run around the classroom without any purpose ; they clap their hands , saying ho-ho-ho and ha-ha-ha ; and they actually look each other in the eye , something few sane people would attempt on berlin 's own mean streets . " fake it until you make it , " is maier 's motto and her students of laughter have to pretend to crack up until the real thing comes along . she admits that it all appears very german , this need to train germans to do something that comes naturally to most people , but it does n't bother her . bildunterschrift : they seem to be doing pretty well already " if germans can only learn to laugh through a kind of formal methodology , we 'll go ahead and use it , " she said . there 's a good chance maier will be successful : after all , following orders - unlike laughing - is n't something germans seem to have a problem with . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
but it was the five time world champions who took the lead in the tenth minute with a fine moment of artistry from ronaldinho , who escaped kaji 's attentions and ran half the length of the pitch to feed robinho who had brilliantly slipped his marker , the 21-year-old striker angling his shot from the left past yoshikatsu kawaguchi . only kawaguchi 's right post prevented japan going further behind when a kaka rocket ricocheted off it soon after .
the crossbar at the other end was responsible for denying a header from kaji off mitsuo ogasawura 's free kick as the asian champions ' pace began to nettle the brazilians . japan equalizes then on 27 minutes they got a deserved equalizer with marcos only getting his fingertips to nakamura 's shot after an attack which had its origins in a hidetoshi nakata-taken free kick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
ronaldinho restored brazil 's supremacy when robinho crossed from the left for the barcelona star to slide the ball in from in front of goal in the 32nd minute . the second half was barely born when nakamura had his head in his hands after a point-blank effort saved by marcos - up at the other end only kawaguchi 's bravery kept the ball from going in when the former portsmouth keeper took the full force of juan 's shot in his face . adriano , having an off day , made way for julio baptista with kaka replaced by baptista 's seville teammate renato on the hour mark and shortly after there was another new face on the pitch belonging to the brazilian fan who breached the tight security cordon . he ran up to ronaldinho before jumping into the japan goal 's netting , five security guards in hot pursuit in the third incident of this nature at the 2005 confed cup which will give organizers cause for concern ahead of next year 's world cup . bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equalizer . japan had the last word when oguro repeated his feat against greece and scored the late leveller after a beautiful free kick over the wall by nakamura hit the post .
all oguro had to do was sink the rebound . " i 'm pleased with my freekick but disappointed we have n't qualified , " said nakamura , who was named man-of-the-match . soccer gods brazil nearly suffered a massive upset when in the match 's waning seconds , japan nearly scored again .
only a save by keeper marcos kept the world champions from going home early . mexico tops group b mexico will face argentina in the semi-finals of the confederations cup after a 0-0 draw against greece in the other group b match on wednesday .
the scoreless draw , the first of the tournament so far , helps mexico stretch their unbeaten run to 21 games . mexico won the competition in their homeland back in 1999 and if they can continue their unbeaten run for two more games the trophy will be theirs again . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sways critics with resolute play confederations cup host germany is n't resting on its laurels after its 2-2 draw against soccer heavyweight argentina on tuesday .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .
" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july . " weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .
he is the last surviving member of the 274th germany infantry regiment that carried out the massacre . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi massacre trial reopens old wounds a prosecutor on thursday demanded life imprisonment for 10 former nazi german soldiers , now in their 80s , who are on trial for the wartime nazi massacre of 560 civilians in an italian mountain village .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .
" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july . " weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .
he is the last surviving member of the 274th germany infantry regiment that carried out the massacre . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi massacre trial reopens old wounds a prosecutor on thursday demanded life imprisonment for 10 former nazi german soldiers , now in their 80s , who are on trial for the wartime nazi massacre of 560 civilians in an italian mountain village .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .
and if they 're seeking ballot box representation all over the country , they need a total of 28,000 signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the law and order party save germany ?
it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .
we only have a twelfth of the time to collect them , which makes it very difficult for smaller parties , " wagner said . cautious targets although some minor parties , such as the christian pbc , set the bar high with an outspoken aim to make it into the bundestag , gaining enough momentum to jump the five percent hurdle is not what motivates every party to run in the federal elections . " our aim is quite different .
we are hoping to get 0.5 percent of the vote in order to recover some of our election campaign costs so we have the financial basis to run as a conservative-liberal party in the 2009 elections , " wagner said . reaching this modest , more realistic target is not without implications for small parties , which receive 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 0.84 -rrb- for each vote they win .
the money , which is paid out in installments between one federal election and another , can make a huge difference to poor parties . hildegard stöber of the pbc , who believes that what germany really needs is a christian government , says a little more money would go a long way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pbc want to see germany run by the rules of the holy book " we need people to run our election campaign , we need posters .

" we 'd love to recover some of our costs , but we are neither dreamers nor illusionists , and we know it wo n't happen .
what we are getting from the excitement of this early ballot is much more attention , our ideas are being spread , " he said . bildunterschrift : protecting nature is just one of the violets ' priorities and both he and stöber claim that this time round , they have noticed a heightened interest - particularly among younger members of the electorate - in what marginal parties have to offer over the hollow promises of the big contenders . " i see that people who once belonged to more established parties are now drifting towards us .
they are beginning to notice that there is not much difference in the policies of the conservatives and liberals versus those of the social democrats and the greens , " chemnitz said . but if research by the infratest election research institute is anything to go on , there is a body of evidence to suggest that when push comes to shove , voters are not prepared to go that extra mile and put their trust in an unknown quantity .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 voting outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans vote big or small come polling day ?
as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 immigration concerns unfounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is immigration really a cause for concern in western countries ?
concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration .

top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 immigration concerns unfounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is immigration really a cause for concern in western countries ?
concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .
also , a " global village " is being built south of cologne which will demonstrate renewable energy use .
and finally , there will be discussions and lectures about the environment and conservation , so that pilgrims can take a little environmental friendliness home with them . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal visit to germany confirmed its official : the vatican has announced that pope benedict xvi will visit the city of cologne on the occasion of world youth day this august .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 voting outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans vote big or small come polling day ?
as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .
and if they 're seeking ballot box representation all over the country , they need a total of 28,000 signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the law and order party save germany ?
it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .
we only have a twelfth of the time to collect them , which makes it very difficult for smaller parties , " wagner said . cautious targets although some minor parties , such as the christian pbc , set the bar high with an outspoken aim to make it into the bundestag , gaining enough momentum to jump the five percent hurdle is not what motivates every party to run in the federal elections . " our aim is quite different .
we are hoping to get 0.5 percent of the vote in order to recover some of our election campaign costs so we have the financial basis to run as a conservative-liberal party in the 2009 elections , " wagner said . reaching this modest , more realistic target is not without implications for small parties , which receive 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 0.84 -rrb- for each vote they win .
the money , which is paid out in installments between one federal election and another , can make a huge difference to poor parties . hildegard stöber of the pbc , who believes that what germany really needs is a christian government , says a little more money would go a long way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pbc want to see germany run by the rules of the holy book " we need people to run our election campaign , we need posters .
many small parties fail simply because they do n't have enough money .
our members are volunteers who have to fit the work in around their paid jobs .
if we had more money , we could pay people to do more , " she said . spreading the political gospel although it is highly unlikely that germany will ever embrace the idea of a theocracy , stöber 's complaint is echoed through the ranks of many minor parties across the country . jörg chemnitz of the violets party , which campaigns on an environmental , humanistic and spiritual platform , would be equally grateful for a bit of loose change , but he 's not banking on it coming his way . " we 'd love to recover some of our costs , but we are neither dreamers nor illusionists , and we know it wo n't happen .
what we are getting from the excitement of this early ballot is much more attention , our ideas are being spread , " he said . bildunterschrift : protecting nature is just one of the violets ' priorities and both he and stöber claim that this time round , they have noticed a heightened interest - particularly among younger members of the electorate - in what marginal parties have to offer over the hollow promises of the big contenders . " i see that people who once belonged to more established parties are now drifting towards us .
they are beginning to notice that there is not much difference in the policies of the conservatives and liberals versus those of the social democrats and the greens , " chemnitz said . but if research by the infratest election research institute is anything to go on , there is a body of evidence to suggest that when push comes to shove , voters are not prepared to go that extra mile and put their trust in an unknown quantity .
it 's a case of sticking to one of the few devils they already know so well . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poll puts merkel ahead of schröder german opposition leader angela merkel has moved ahead of chancellor gerhard schröder in opinion polls for the first time with a general election expected in september , a new poll showed on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 immigration concerns unfounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is immigration really a cause for concern in western countries ?
concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .
also , a " global village " is being built south of cologne which will demonstrate renewable energy use .
and finally , there will be discussions and lectures about the environment and conservation , so that pilgrims can take a little environmental friendliness home with them . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal visit to germany confirmed its official : the vatican has announced that pope benedict xvi will visit the city of cologne on the occasion of world youth day this august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 immigration concerns unfounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is immigration really a cause for concern in western countries ?
concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

humiliated by mexico by a single goal , brazil is under pressure to win - though even a draw would do - against japan on wednesday in order to advance through to the semi-finals on sunday of the eight-nation tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira on tuesday , brazil coach carlos alberto parreira was playing his cards close to his chest though he 'd hinted earlier that he 'd be making sweeping changes for the crucial match that will determine whether it is the world or asian champions who join mexico , germany and argentina in the semi-finals .

" normally , i 'd give the team -lsb- lineup -rsb- but for special reasons this time i 'm going to wait . " brazilian media was rife with rumors this week about major swaps in the team 's defense .

in addition , the japanese can also look forward to a visit from japanese princess takamado during their duel against brazil . zico , who will be confronting his fellow countrymen for the first time on wednesday as japan 's coach , also said he would be singing brazil 's national anthem .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .
" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july . " weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .

" weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .

but the real action will be in cologne as japan battles brazil for a spot in the semi-finals . suspense has been building in the rundown to wednesday 's crunch confederations cup group b decider between asian champions japan and world cup holders brazil amid growing speculation about possible shuffles in brazil 's team lineup . fresh off a victory against greece , the japanese team appeared visibly more relaxed than its brazilian counterparts during a training session in leverkusen on monday .
humiliated by mexico by a single goal , brazil is under pressure to win - though even a draw would do - against japan on wednesday in order to advance through to the semi-finals on sunday of the eight-nation tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira on tuesday , brazil coach carlos alberto parreira was playing his cards close to his chest though he 'd hinted earlier that he 'd be making sweeping changes for the crucial match that will determine whether it is the world or asian champions who join mexico , germany and argentina in the semi-finals .

" normally , i 'd give the team -lsb- lineup -rsb- but for special reasons this time i 'm going to wait . " brazilian media was rife with rumors this week about major swaps in the team 's defense .

" the japan coach believes his asian champions can upset his fellow countrymen and follow group b leaders mexico through to the semi-finals . " if we play as we played against greece our chances are good , " zico said .
" we know the brazilian players .
we know everything about the opposition .
we respect the power of brazil but we have to fight for our result and do everything we can to win .

in addition , the japanese can also look forward to a visit from japanese princess takamado during their duel against brazil . zico , who will be confronting his fellow countrymen for the first time on wednesday as japan 's coach , also said he would be singing brazil 's national anthem . " i 've been singing it before i went to school .

i will sing it with joy and happiness , but afterwards i will be working for japan . " greece playing for pride in contrast , the second match in the group b final between greece and mexico in frankfurt on wednesday lacks much of a punch .

gam , which belongs to swiss banking giant ubs , holds about 1.5 million hvb shares .
but fund manager john bennett told the business daily handelsblatt that gam believed unicredit 's bid price was too low .
the italian giant is offering five of its own shares for every hvb share held , effectively pricing hvb shares at 22 euros -lrb- $ 26.60 -rrb- a piece .
but bennett said the hvb shares were worth 25-27 euros each .
" we 're not going to sell under current conditions , " the fund manager told the newspaper .
gam is not the first hvb shareholder to criticize the terms of the offer .
austrian shareholder , the avz foundation , which holds a stake of four percent , was also critical , saying it would make a final decision whether to accept the offer in september .
nevertheless , most analysts believe shareholder resistance to the deal will not be strong enough to scupper it altogether . dw-world.de a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .
also , a " global village " is being built south of cologne which will demonstrate renewable energy use .
and finally , there will be discussions and lectures about the environment and conservation , so that pilgrims can take a little environmental friendliness home with them . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal visit to germany confirmed its official : the vatican has announced that pope benedict xvi will visit the city of cologne on the occasion of world youth day this august .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .

we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up .

the crossbar at the other end was responsible for denying a header from kaji off mitsuo ogasawura 's free kick as the asian champions ' pace began to nettle the brazilians . japan equalizes then on 27 minutes they got a deserved equalizer with marcos only getting his fingertips to nakamura 's shot after an attack which had its origins in a hidetoshi nakata-taken free kick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .

the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equalizer . japan had the last word when oguro repeated his feat against greece and scored the late leveller after a beautiful free kick over the wall by nakamura hit the post .
all oguro had to do was sink the rebound . " i 'm pleased with my freekick but disappointed we have n't qualified , " said nakamura , who was named man-of-the-match . soccer gods brazil nearly suffered a massive upset when in the match 's waning seconds , japan nearly scored again .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .
also , a " global village " is being built south of cologne which will demonstrate renewable energy use .
and finally , there will be discussions and lectures about the environment and conservation , so that pilgrims can take a little environmental friendliness home with them . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal visit to germany confirmed its official : the vatican has announced that pope benedict xvi will visit the city of cologne on the occasion of world youth day this august .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up .

the crossbar at the other end was responsible for denying a header from kaji off mitsuo ogasawura 's free kick as the asian champions ' pace began to nettle the brazilians . japan equalizes then on 27 minutes they got a deserved equalizer with marcos only getting his fingertips to nakamura 's shot after an attack which had its origins in a hidetoshi nakata-taken free kick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .

all oguro had to do was sink the rebound . " i 'm pleased with my freekick but disappointed we have n't qualified , " said nakamura , who was named man-of-the-match . soccer gods brazil nearly suffered a massive upset when in the match 's waning seconds , japan nearly scored again .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 voting outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans vote big or small come polling day ?
as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .
and if they 're seeking ballot box representation all over the country , they need a total of 28,000 signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the law and order party save germany ?
it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .
we only have a twelfth of the time to collect them , which makes it very difficult for smaller parties , " wagner said . cautious targets although some minor parties , such as the christian pbc , set the bar high with an outspoken aim to make it into the bundestag , gaining enough momentum to jump the five percent hurdle is not what motivates every party to run in the federal elections . " our aim is quite different .
we are hoping to get 0.5 percent of the vote in order to recover some of our election campaign costs so we have the financial basis to run as a conservative-liberal party in the 2009 elections , " wagner said . reaching this modest , more realistic target is not without implications for small parties , which receive 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 0.84 -rrb- for each vote they win .
the money , which is paid out in installments between one federal election and another , can make a huge difference to poor parties . hildegard stöber of the pbc , who believes that what germany really needs is a christian government , says a little more money would go a long way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pbc want to see germany run by the rules of the holy book " we need people to run our election campaign , we need posters .
many small parties fail simply because they do n't have enough money .
our members are volunteers who have to fit the work in around their paid jobs .
if we had more money , we could pay people to do more , " she said . spreading the political gospel although it is highly unlikely that germany will ever embrace the idea of a theocracy , stöber 's complaint is echoed through the ranks of many minor parties across the country . jörg chemnitz of the violets party , which campaigns on an environmental , humanistic and spiritual platform , would be equally grateful for a bit of loose change , but he 's not banking on it coming his way . " we 'd love to recover some of our costs , but we are neither dreamers nor illusionists , and we know it wo n't happen .
what we are getting from the excitement of this early ballot is much more attention , our ideas are being spread , " he said . bildunterschrift : protecting nature is just one of the violets ' priorities and both he and stöber claim that this time round , they have noticed a heightened interest - particularly among younger members of the electorate - in what marginal parties have to offer over the hollow promises of the big contenders . " i see that people who once belonged to more established parties are now drifting towards us .
they are beginning to notice that there is not much difference in the policies of the conservatives and liberals versus those of the social democrats and the greens , " chemnitz said . but if research by the infratest election research institute is anything to go on , there is a body of evidence to suggest that when push comes to shove , voters are not prepared to go that extra mile and put their trust in an unknown quantity .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .

but the real action will be in cologne as japan battles brazil for a spot in the semi-finals . suspense has been building in the rundown to wednesday 's crunch confederations cup group b decider between asian champions japan and world cup holders brazil amid growing speculation about possible shuffles in brazil 's team lineup . fresh off a victory against greece , the japanese team appeared visibly more relaxed than its brazilian counterparts during a training session in leverkusen on monday .
humiliated by mexico by a single goal , brazil is under pressure to win - though even a draw would do - against japan on wednesday in order to advance through to the semi-finals on sunday of the eight-nation tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira on tuesday , brazil coach carlos alberto parreira was playing his cards close to his chest though he 'd hinted earlier that he 'd be making sweeping changes for the crucial match that will determine whether it is the world or asian champions who join mexico , germany and argentina in the semi-finals . " i 'll be making changes , but perhaps not as many as you think , " parreira said playfully .
" normally , i 'd give the team -lsb- lineup -rsb- but for special reasons this time i 'm going to wait . " brazilian media was rife with rumors this week about major swaps in the team 's defense .
parreira confirmed monday that he wanted to change his defense , with marcos likely to come in for dida as goalkeeper and leo and maicon replacing cicinho and gilberto .
he may also break up the so-called " fantastic quartet " of robinho , ronaldinho , adriano and kaka . bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano , left , and ronaldinho , right , congratulate robinho parreira insisted that even a defeat by japan would not cost him his job .
" if that happens , no one 's going to get fired .
our aim is to prepare the team for the world cup next year , but of course if we have the opportunity to win here we will take it . " japan raring to go meanwhile brazilian-born japan coach zico said he was keeping his team unchanged for the decider against brazil .
japan must beat world cup holders brazil if it is to progress to the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico the former brazilian national soccer star said he was keeping faith in keiji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa - his two strikers who failed to shine against greece - for wednesday 's decider against brazil . " just because they missed goal-scoring opportunities it does n't mean they were playing bad soccer , " zico said .
" tamada and yanagisawa created a lot of chances and opened up the middle to offer opportunities to the midfielders to come along and score too . " the japan coach believes his asian champions can upset his fellow countrymen and follow group b leaders mexico through to the semi-finals . " if we play as we played against greece our chances are good , " zico said .
" we know the brazilian players .
we know everything about the opposition .
we respect the power of brazil but we have to fight for our result and do everything we can to win . " a noticeable characteristic of japan 's training sessions is the enthusiastic atmosphere in which they 're held , a spirit zico said he had deliberately tried to foster since he took over as coach after the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : japanese soccer team supporters " that 's the way we operate .
we have to take pleasure from soccer as a group and that spirit comes through in a match , " he said .
" we play with a lot of joy . "
though japan 's recent record against brazil does not make happy reading , zico said that the past is the past .
in addition , the japanese can also look forward to a visit from japanese princess takamado during their duel against brazil . zico , who will be confronting his fellow countrymen for the first time on wednesday as japan 's coach , also said he would be singing brazil 's national anthem . " i 've been singing it before i went to school .
it 's part of my life .
i will sing it with joy and happiness , but afterwards i will be working for japan . " greece playing for pride in contrast , the second match in the group b final between greece and mexico in frankfurt on wednesday lacks much of a punch .
european champion greece is merely playing for pride since it has already been eliminated from the tournament after they went down to brazil -lrb- 3-0 -rrb- and japan -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto rehhagel greece has been on a downward spiral since euro 2004 and their german coach " king otto " rehhagel has seen the red carpet swept from under his feet . " i really thought my team would have played better in this tournament , " rehhagel said on tuesday .
after a dreadful tournament , rehhagel has switched his focus to some vital qualifying matches for the 2006 world cup . " we have to get used to winning " while greek fans are ready to go home , mexican supporters are on a high .
mexico produced the biggest shock of the confederations cup by defeating world champions brazil 1-0 in their last group match and the team has already secured a place in the semi-finals on sunday with a maximum six points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's ricardo osorio , left , heads the ball away from brazil 's robinho " it 's satisfying to see how we 're growing and able to beat great teams .
we 're getting better all the time , " mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said . mexico is also dreaming of a repeat of its 1999 success in the competition .
that year mexico also defeated brazil , winning the final 4-3 in front of home fans .
a point against greece on wednesday would secure top spot in group b. " we have to get used to winning , make it a habit , " lavolpe said .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 voting outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans vote big or small come polling day ?
as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .
and if they 're seeking ballot box representation all over the country , they need a total of 28,000 signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the law and order party save germany ?
it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 voting outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans vote big or small come polling day ?
as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .
and if they 're seeking ballot box representation all over the country , they need a total of 28,000 signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the law and order party save germany ?
it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .
we only have a twelfth of the time to collect them , which makes it very difficult for smaller parties , " wagner said . cautious targets although some minor parties , such as the christian pbc , set the bar high with an outspoken aim to make it into the bundestag , gaining enough momentum to jump the five percent hurdle is not what motivates every party to run in the federal elections . " our aim is quite different .
we are hoping to get 0.5 percent of the vote in order to recover some of our election campaign costs so we have the financial basis to run as a conservative-liberal party in the 2009 elections , " wagner said . reaching this modest , more realistic target is not without implications for small parties , which receive 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 0.84 -rrb- for each vote they win .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
but it was the five time world champions who took the lead in the tenth minute with a fine moment of artistry from ronaldinho , who escaped kaji 's attentions and ran half the length of the pitch to feed robinho who had brilliantly slipped his marker , the 21-year-old striker angling his shot from the left past yoshikatsu kawaguchi . only kawaguchi 's right post prevented japan going further behind when a kaka rocket ricocheted off it soon after .
the crossbar at the other end was responsible for denying a header from kaji off mitsuo ogasawura 's free kick as the asian champions ' pace began to nettle the brazilians . japan equalizes then on 27 minutes they got a deserved equalizer with marcos only getting his fingertips to nakamura 's shot after an attack which had its origins in a hidetoshi nakata-taken free kick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
but it was the five time world champions who took the lead in the tenth minute with a fine moment of artistry from ronaldinho , who escaped kaji 's attentions and ran half the length of the pitch to feed robinho who had brilliantly slipped his marker , the 21-year-old striker angling his shot from the left past yoshikatsu kawaguchi . only kawaguchi 's right post prevented japan going further behind when a kaka rocket ricocheted off it soon after .
the crossbar at the other end was responsible for denying a header from kaji off mitsuo ogasawura 's free kick as the asian champions ' pace began to nettle the brazilians . japan equalizes then on 27 minutes they got a deserved equalizer with marcos only getting his fingertips to nakamura 's shot after an attack which had its origins in a hidetoshi nakata-taken free kick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .

but its determined performance seems to have finally silenced the sceptics . the german media was in a more positive mood on wednesday as it reflected on germany 's 2-2 draw with argentina in the confederations cup match .
the draw sees germany reach the semi-finals as winner of group a , with argentina also qualifying for the last four as runner-up . " after the 90 minutes in nuremberg we know we do not need to hide from anyone , " declared mass-circulation daily bild . " we should not fear the favorites for the world cup as argentina crushed brazil 3-1 in the qualifying campaign . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sebastian deisler , left , runs clear of his teammate kevin kuranyi , center , who is held back by argentina 's juan sorin tuesday 's match at the 42,000-strong franken stadium in nuremberg saw brazilian-born german striker kevin kuranyi notch up the first goal in the 29th minute before argentinean midfielder and man of the match juan roman riquelme scored an equalizer with a blistering free kick minutes later .
gerald asamoah restored germany 's lead in the 51st minute and argentina 's esteban cambiasso leveled with a superb shot . german captain michael ballack was rested for the match with germany already having qualified for the semi-final .
but , coach jürgen klinsmann said the move was also aimed at encouraging more players to shoulder responsibility and was an indication that the team was n't too dependant on ballack . " national team shines without -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack , " said the respected frankfurter allgemeine daily . klinsmann , 40 , however insisted that the move did n't endanger the team 's performance .
" it was not a risk to rest ballack as we knew this side could do the job . " germany on a par with soccer heavyweights yet the job was not quite completed and the search for a win against a top nation goes on .
not since the 1-0 win over england in october 2000 has germany defeated a recognized top-ranked team . " germany made to wait for big win , " headlined daily berliner morgenpost .
" but klinsmann 's side can be proud of reaching the semi-finals as group winners after a determined display . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann however klinsmann put a positive spin on tuesday 's result .
" we have n't won against a heavyweight for at least five years but you can also see things differently : since we began in july 2004 -lrb- with klinsmann as coach -rrb- , we have n't lost against the big guns either . " assistant coach joachim löw agreed : " the big guns simply ca n't beat us anymore , " hinting that a year before the next world cup , germany was once again on a par with soccer greats argentina and brazil on its own turf even without captain ballack . even german soccer federation chief gerhard mayer-vorfelder was full of praise .
" one could see that it was possible even without ballack and that makes one a bit prouder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's juan roman riquelme compliments rained in from rivals argentina , too .
coach jose pekerman said germany was difficult to play against while star midfielder riquelme called it a " great team . " still missing that extra touch but despite the bouquets , klinsmann was far from overrating his team 's performance and sober in his assessment of what the team still lacked to go for the kill .
" the last bit of determination and alertness was missing in crucial situations , " he said . perhaps we miss that extra touch of class against the top sides , " admitted midfielder bastian schweinsteiger .
" sometimes we need to use our heads more . " schweinsteiger will miss the semi-final after picking up a yellow card and must hope his team-mates can give him the opportunity to play in the final on june 29 in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , kevin kuranyi and mike hanke world champion brazil is one possible opponent for germany , as are japan and mexico , but klinsmann prefers to face the big guns . " we would prefer to play against a big team in the semi-finals , " insisted klinsmann .
" perhaps brazil in the next round and , if we beat it , argentina again in the final . " mexico leads group b and is the only team to secure a spot in the last four with brazil and japan fighting it out on wednesday for the right to join them . " can we now expect the mighty brazil ? " asked daily bild . in september last year germany drew 1-1 with brazil in berlin but the memory of the 2-0 defeat in the 2002 world cup final in yokohama still lingers . but , for now klinsmann is clear that the team can pat itself on the back for tuesday 's performance .

an entrepreneur in berlin wants to change that and wants to educate his countrymen about the joy of laughing . chortling , chuckling , giggling and busting a gut are words not often associated with germans , whose spectrum of facial expressions generally ranges from dour to , if you 're lucky , neutral .
susanne maier , a therapist and german herself , admits as much . " we germans are n't very easygoing and loose , " she told der spiegel magazine .
" we 've got to laugh before we make ourselves sick . " to ward off any collective despair-fueled illness -lrb- which some might say has already struck -rrb- , maier has opened berlin 's first school to actually teach germans to laugh , since the jolly gene for that appears to have mutated out of the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' international laughing club ' members gesture and laugh as they celebrate world laughers day in bangalore , india , on may 2 , 2004 .
the laughing club was founded in 1995 by madan kataria with the belief that laughing fits boost the immune system .
it 's not a new idea .
maier took it from india , where 10 years ago a doctor , madan kataria , developed laughter yoga .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .
" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july . " weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .
he is the last surviving member of the 274th germany infantry regiment that carried out the massacre . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi massacre trial reopens old wounds a prosecutor on thursday demanded life imprisonment for 10 former nazi german soldiers , now in their 80s , who are on trial for the wartime nazi massacre of 560 civilians in an italian mountain village .

spd presents election manifesto germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 voting outside the box großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will germans vote big or small come polling day ?
as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .
and if they 're seeking ballot box representation all over the country , they need a total of 28,000 signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the law and order party save germany ?
it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .
we only have a twelfth of the time to collect them , which makes it very difficult for smaller parties , " wagner said . cautious targets although some minor parties , such as the christian pbc , set the bar high with an outspoken aim to make it into the bundestag , gaining enough momentum to jump the five percent hurdle is not what motivates every party to run in the federal elections . " our aim is quite different .
we are hoping to get 0.5 percent of the vote in order to recover some of our election campaign costs so we have the financial basis to run as a conservative-liberal party in the 2009 elections , " wagner said . reaching this modest , more realistic target is not without implications for small parties , which receive 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 0.84 -rrb- for each vote they win .
the money , which is paid out in installments between one federal election and another , can make a huge difference to poor parties . hildegard stöber of the pbc , who believes that what germany really needs is a christian government , says a little more money would go a long way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pbc want to see germany run by the rules of the holy book " we need people to run our election campaign , we need posters .
many small parties fail simply because they do n't have enough money .
our members are volunteers who have to fit the work in around their paid jobs .
if we had more money , we could pay people to do more , " she said . spreading the political gospel although it is highly unlikely that germany will ever embrace the idea of a theocracy , stöber 's complaint is echoed through the ranks of many minor parties across the country . jörg chemnitz of the violets party , which campaigns on an environmental , humanistic and spiritual platform , would be equally grateful for a bit of loose change , but he 's not banking on it coming his way . " we 'd love to recover some of our costs , but we are neither dreamers nor illusionists , and we know it wo n't happen .
what we are getting from the excitement of this early ballot is much more attention , our ideas are being spread , " he said . bildunterschrift : protecting nature is just one of the violets ' priorities and both he and stöber claim that this time round , they have noticed a heightened interest - particularly among younger members of the electorate - in what marginal parties have to offer over the hollow promises of the big contenders . " i see that people who once belonged to more established parties are now drifting towards us .
they are beginning to notice that there is not much difference in the policies of the conservatives and liberals versus those of the social democrats and the greens , " chemnitz said . but if research by the infratest election research institute is anything to go on , there is a body of evidence to suggest that when push comes to shove , voters are not prepared to go that extra mile and put their trust in an unknown quantity .
it 's a case of sticking to one of the few devils they already know so well . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poll puts merkel ahead of schröder german opposition leader angela merkel has moved ahead of chancellor gerhard schröder in opinion polls for the first time with a general election expected in september , a new poll showed on friday .

as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

gam , which belongs to swiss banking giant ubs , holds about 1.5 million hvb shares .

" we 're not going to sell under current conditions , " the fund manager told the newspaper .
gam is not the first hvb shareholder to criticize the terms of the offer .
austrian shareholder , the avz foundation , which holds a stake of four percent , was also critical , saying it would make a final decision whether to accept the offer in september .
nevertheless , most analysts believe shareholder resistance to the deal will not be strong enough to scupper it altogether . dw-world.de a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .

gam , which belongs to swiss banking giant ubs , holds about 1.5 million hvb shares .
but fund manager john bennett told the business daily handelsblatt that gam believed unicredit 's bid price was too low .
the italian giant is offering five of its own shares for every hvb share held , effectively pricing hvb shares at 22 euros -lrb- $ 26.60 -rrb- a piece .
but bennett said the hvb shares were worth 25-27 euros each .
" we 're not going to sell under current conditions , " the fund manager told the newspaper .
gam is not the first hvb shareholder to criticize the terms of the offer .
austrian shareholder , the avz foundation , which holds a stake of four percent , was also critical , saying it would make a final decision whether to accept the offer in september .
nevertheless , most analysts believe shareholder resistance to the deal will not be strong enough to scupper it altogether . dw-world.de a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .
the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market .

the bloc subsidizes new farms in areas where few exist and supports efforts to improve the processing and marketing of agricultural products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olive tree plantation , near alquera , portugal one important segment is the funding of specific products .
a german farmer receives money for exporting eggs while a spanish winegrower gets eu euros for his work .
grain subsidies make up the biggest portion with 11 billion euros while two billion euros are spent on aiding the production of olive oil . in 2003 , the distribution of aid changed profoundly as eu leaders did away with a system that remunerated farmers according to the amount they produced . " this was meant to get farmers to adjust their production levels to market demands , " said monika hartmann of the institute for agricultural policies in bonn . now , special requirements can be attached to payments . " cross-compliance makes it possible to check that farmers adhere to fertilization and labeling rules , " said udo hemmerling , an expert on economic policies at the german farmers ' association . some checks are in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers meanwhile are not in direct contact with brussels at any time .
subsidies are distributed by local governments - in germany , that responsibility lies with the 16 states . all member states also have control systems in place to prevent abuse .
according to hemmerling , agencies check 5 percent of farms each year .
he added that as a result of the checks , reclaims can amount to hundreds of millions of euros in some member states . a global problem the reason why only few politicians are willing to criticize the subsidies has to do with national interests .
while france heads the lists of subsidy backers , germany 's agriculture also could not survive without the help .
in bad years , german farmers barely manage to make enough money to cover their costs - a problem that 's largely caused by price dumping in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international comparisons show that few countries can manage without agricultural subsidies .
switzerland , japan and the us all protect their own farmers , making it even harder to scale back subsidies . that 's why researchers and farmer representatives see a multilateral approach as the only way to change things in the long run . daniel wortmann -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de quo vadis , europe ?
the failure to agree on a budget has exposed differences over the eu 's future .
britain , which has been blamed for the crisis , can not force its path on others , said austria 's schüssel , who inherits the presidency in 2006 .

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .
also , a " global village " is being built south of cologne which will demonstrate renewable energy use .
and finally , there will be discussions and lectures about the environment and conservation , so that pilgrims can take a little environmental friendliness home with them . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal visit to germany confirmed its official : the vatican has announced that pope benedict xvi will visit the city of cologne on the occasion of world youth day this august .

" to maximize financial benefits of assistance , the new iraqi government must continue to improve security , liberalize its economy and open political space for all members of iraqi society who reject violence , " rice told the gathering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice says iraq needs to help itself more the diplomats planned to give the aid and expertise needed to help iraq build democratic political bodies , revive its economy and form a police and armed force capable of securing the country without the us-led occupation .
but the details and concrete decisions on such help will be made at another donors ' conference next month in jordan . rice said that iraqis deserved the full support of the countries represented here - including russia , japan , china , malaysia , india , brazil , iran , turkey and most arab nations . diplomats want iraq to step up participants not only called on iraq to assume much of the burden but urged its neighbors to prevent extremists from infiltrating the country as well as show greater diplomatic support for the new iraq . syria in particular was accused by rice of failing to prevent militants from crossing its border into iraq . egypt and jordon meanwhile became the first arab countries to send an ambassador to iraq since the arabs vehemently opposed the us-led invasion of march 2003 , it was announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient country recognizes a renewed one iraqi foreign minister hoshyar zebari saluted egypt for its role " in showing regional leadership by " appointing the envoy " we hope soon to welcome in the new iraq , " reported afp . he also urged the european union , which is a co-sponsor of the conference with the united states , to act quickly and fully on its decision to open a mission in baghdad . eu united to help european diplomats said the eu had overcome internal rows over the invasion and had united to help rebuild iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan , left , has told an international conference that nations must reassure iraq that they have the world 's support as iraqis rebuild and secure their country .

" it was not a risk to rest ballack as we knew this side could do the job . " germany on a par with soccer heavyweights yet the job was not quite completed and the search for a win against a top nation goes on .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .

" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july . " weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .
" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july . " weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .
he is the last surviving member of the 274th germany infantry regiment that carried out the massacre . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi massacre trial reopens old wounds a prosecutor on thursday demanded life imprisonment for 10 former nazi german soldiers , now in their 80s , who are on trial for the wartime nazi massacre of 560 civilians in an italian mountain village .

as germany 's major-league parties fine tune their arguments ahead of elections , the country 's numerous fringe groups are trying to adapt to the blow the possibility of an early ballot has dealt to their chances . collectively , the names of germany 's marginal parties sound like the stuff of young alice 's wonderland .
from the fun party to the anarchic german pogo party , from the grey panthers to the car drivers ' party , come the federal elections , voting outside of the box is easily done .
but for all the imagination of the names and the policies they represent , these parties take their plights very seriously .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colorful small-fry voting regulations in germany are such that smaller parties have little on their side but an inherent faith in themselves and whatever support they are able to drum up among the electorate .
even for the bigger of the small fish , the chance of ever having a face in parliament is a distant dream . they are held at arm 's length by a clause that stipulates that only those parties which manage to garner at least five percent of the vote or three constituency seats may be represented in parliament .
the idea behind the clause , which was introduced in 1953 , was to keep splinter parties out and create an environment in which larger parties could obtain the majorities needed to govern . supporting signatures in order for smaller parties to be allowed to run in a federal ballot at all , they first have to prove they are serious contenders , which they do by collecting signatures . depending on the size of the state in which they plan to run candidates , they are expected to gather between 800 and 2,000 names to back their electoral efforts .
and if they 're seeking ballot box representation all over the country , they need a total of 28,000 signatures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the law and order party save germany ?
it 's a tall order for groups that generally rely upon the goodwill of their members to do the collecting .
markus wagner , leader of the right-wing populist law and order party , or offensive d , says the short run-up to september 's elections will make their job particularly difficult . " it is certainly our intention to run in the federal elections , but it depends on signature numbers .
we only have a twelfth of the time to collect them , which makes it very difficult for smaller parties , " wagner said . cautious targets although some minor parties , such as the christian pbc , set the bar high with an outspoken aim to make it into the bundestag , gaining enough momentum to jump the five percent hurdle is not what motivates every party to run in the federal elections . " our aim is quite different .
we are hoping to get 0.5 percent of the vote in order to recover some of our election campaign costs so we have the financial basis to run as a conservative-liberal party in the 2009 elections , " wagner said . reaching this modest , more realistic target is not without implications for small parties , which receive 0.70 euros -lrb- $ 0.84 -rrb- for each vote they win .
the money , which is paid out in installments between one federal election and another , can make a huge difference to poor parties . hildegard stöber of the pbc , who believes that what germany really needs is a christian government , says a little more money would go a long way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pbc want to see germany run by the rules of the holy book " we need people to run our election campaign , we need posters .
many small parties fail simply because they do n't have enough money .
our members are volunteers who have to fit the work in around their paid jobs .
if we had more money , we could pay people to do more , " she said . spreading the political gospel although it is highly unlikely that germany will ever embrace the idea of a theocracy , stöber 's complaint is echoed through the ranks of many minor parties across the country . jörg chemnitz of the violets party , which campaigns on an environmental , humanistic and spiritual platform , would be equally grateful for a bit of loose change , but he 's not banking on it coming his way . " we 'd love to recover some of our costs , but we are neither dreamers nor illusionists , and we know it wo n't happen .
what we are getting from the excitement of this early ballot is much more attention , our ideas are being spread , " he said . bildunterschrift : protecting nature is just one of the violets ' priorities and both he and stöber claim that this time round , they have noticed a heightened interest - particularly among younger members of the electorate - in what marginal parties have to offer over the hollow promises of the big contenders . " i see that people who once belonged to more established parties are now drifting towards us .
they are beginning to notice that there is not much difference in the policies of the conservatives and liberals versus those of the social democrats and the greens , " chemnitz said . but if research by the infratest election research institute is anything to go on , there is a body of evidence to suggest that when push comes to shove , voters are not prepared to go that extra mile and put their trust in an unknown quantity .

an entrepreneur in berlin wants to change that and wants to educate his countrymen about the joy of laughing . chortling , chuckling , giggling and busting a gut are words not often associated with germans , whose spectrum of facial expressions generally ranges from dour to , if you 're lucky , neutral .
susanne maier , a therapist and german herself , admits as much . " we germans are n't very easygoing and loose , " she told der spiegel magazine .
" we 've got to laugh before we make ourselves sick . " to ward off any collective despair-fueled illness -lrb- which some might say has already struck -rrb- , maier has opened berlin 's first school to actually teach germans to laugh , since the jolly gene for that appears to have mutated out of the general population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' international laughing club ' members gesture and laugh as they celebrate world laughers day in bangalore , india , on may 2 , 2004 .
the laughing club was founded in 1995 by madan kataria with the belief that laughing fits boost the immune system .
it 's not a new idea .
maier took it from india , where 10 years ago a doctor , madan kataria , developed laughter yoga .
it was meant to relieve stress and improve participants ' quality of life . it 's okay to be silly in the school in a northern district of the capital , participants do very un-german things .
they run around the classroom without any purpose ; they clap their hands , saying ho-ho-ho and ha-ha-ha ; and they actually look each other in the eye , something few sane people would attempt on berlin 's own mean streets . " fake it until you make it , " is maier 's motto and her students of laughter have to pretend to crack up until the real thing comes along . she admits that it all appears very german , this need to train germans to do something that comes naturally to most people , but it does n't bother her . bildunterschrift : they seem to be doing pretty well already " if germans can only learn to laugh through a kind of formal methodology , we 'll go ahead and use it , " she said . there 's a good chance maier will be successful : after all , following orders - unlike laughing - is n't something germans seem to have a problem with . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ?
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- germans have the last laugh could laughter really be the best medicine for ever-serious germans ?
a major meeting on the medical benefits of humor , opening today in essen , will take up the issue .
-lrb- oct .
15 , 2004 -rrb- the best of " from the fringe " we 've gathered a selection of our " and finally ... " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.06.2005 -pipe- 18:00 utc german confidence perks up investor confidence in germany is beginning to perk up , a new poll showed tuesday , on hopes that a fall of the euro will take the heat off exporters and a change in government will lead the euro zone 's biggest economy out of its current doldrums .
but while the tentative brightening of prospects came as a welcome piece of good news , resurgent oil prices constitute an underlying risk to sentiment in the coming months .
and there is no guarantee that a different government will really be better able to cure germany 's economic woes , analysts said .
the zew economic research institute 's economic expectations index , the second most important confidence barometer in germany after the widely watched ifo business climate index , rose by 5.6 points to plus 19.5 points in june , the think-tank said in a statement .
the increase was better than expected : analysts had been penciling in a more modest rise in the index to around 17.3 points this month .
" the reason the sharp rise in economic expectations is , in addition to the tangible decline in the euro exchange rate , the hope that following the autumn elections that necessary reforms will be implemented more energetically , " zew president wolfgang franz explained .
" the outlook is beginning to brighten .
the country needs stable majorities in order to press ahead with overdue , if unpopular reforms .
we ca n't afford any further delays , " franz said .
the zew indicator , which this month was based on responses from 315 financial analysts and institutional investors , represents the balance between positive and negative expectations for the economy over the next six months . dw-world.de german business hails early election investors and industrialists in germany see a change in government as a way out of the country 's economic woes .
but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 immigration concerns unfounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is immigration really a cause for concern in western countries ?
concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.06.2005 immigration concerns unfounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is immigration really a cause for concern in western countries ?
concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .

but the real action will be in cologne as japan battles brazil for a spot in the semi-finals . suspense has been building in the rundown to wednesday 's crunch confederations cup group b decider between asian champions japan and world cup holders brazil amid growing speculation about possible shuffles in brazil 's team lineup . fresh off a victory against greece , the japanese team appeared visibly more relaxed than its brazilian counterparts during a training session in leverkusen on monday .
humiliated by mexico by a single goal , brazil is under pressure to win - though even a draw would do - against japan on wednesday in order to advance through to the semi-finals on sunday of the eight-nation tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira on tuesday , brazil coach carlos alberto parreira was playing his cards close to his chest though he 'd hinted earlier that he 'd be making sweeping changes for the crucial match that will determine whether it is the world or asian champions who join mexico , germany and argentina in the semi-finals . " i 'll be making changes , but perhaps not as many as you think , " parreira said playfully .
" normally , i 'd give the team -lsb- lineup -rsb- but for special reasons this time i 'm going to wait . " brazilian media was rife with rumors this week about major swaps in the team 's defense .
parreira confirmed monday that he wanted to change his defense , with marcos likely to come in for dida as goalkeeper and leo and maicon replacing cicinho and gilberto .
he may also break up the so-called " fantastic quartet " of robinho , ronaldinho , adriano and kaka . bildunterschrift : brazil 's adriano , left , and ronaldinho , right , congratulate robinho parreira insisted that even a defeat by japan would not cost him his job .
" if that happens , no one 's going to get fired .
our aim is to prepare the team for the world cup next year , but of course if we have the opportunity to win here we will take it . " japan raring to go meanwhile brazilian-born japan coach zico said he was keeping his team unchanged for the decider against brazil .
japan must beat world cup holders brazil if it is to progress to the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zico the former brazilian national soccer star said he was keeping faith in keiji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa - his two strikers who failed to shine against greece - for wednesday 's decider against brazil . " just because they missed goal-scoring opportunities it does n't mean they were playing bad soccer , " zico said .
" tamada and yanagisawa created a lot of chances and opened up the middle to offer opportunities to the midfielders to come along and score too . " the japan coach believes his asian champions can upset his fellow countrymen and follow group b leaders mexico through to the semi-finals . " if we play as we played against greece our chances are good , " zico said .
" we know the brazilian players .
we know everything about the opposition .
we respect the power of brazil but we have to fight for our result and do everything we can to win . " a noticeable characteristic of japan 's training sessions is the enthusiastic atmosphere in which they 're held , a spirit zico said he had deliberately tried to foster since he took over as coach after the 2002 world cup . bildunterschrift : japanese soccer team supporters " that 's the way we operate .
we have to take pleasure from soccer as a group and that spirit comes through in a match , " he said .
" we play with a lot of joy . "
though japan 's recent record against brazil does not make happy reading , zico said that the past is the past .
in addition , the japanese can also look forward to a visit from japanese princess takamado during their duel against brazil . zico , who will be confronting his fellow countrymen for the first time on wednesday as japan 's coach , also said he would be singing brazil 's national anthem . " i 've been singing it before i went to school .
it 's part of my life .
i will sing it with joy and happiness , but afterwards i will be working for japan . " greece playing for pride in contrast , the second match in the group b final between greece and mexico in frankfurt on wednesday lacks much of a punch .

after a dreadful tournament , rehhagel has switched his focus to some vital qualifying matches for the 2006 world cup . " we have to get used to winning " while greek fans are ready to go home , mexican supporters are on a high .

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .
also , a " global village " is being built south of cologne which will demonstrate renewable energy use .
and finally , there will be discussions and lectures about the environment and conservation , so that pilgrims can take a little environmental friendliness home with them . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal visit to germany confirmed its official : the vatican has announced that pope benedict xvi will visit the city of cologne on the occasion of world youth day this august .

from august 16 to 20 , all energy used for the event in cologne will also be of the renewable kind .
and the 500,000 leaflets issued to pilgrims will be printed on recycled paper . for the first time , organizers are placing a high priority on the ecological impact of the event . " it 's been clear from the start that environmental damage will arising from the event , " said thomas here , the environment representative for world youth day .
" when you have perhaps 800,000 young people coming to germany , even the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide emissions become a topic for discussion , since they have to arrive and leave by some sort of transportation . " bildunterschrift : banners in cologne announce the upcoming event two months before the 20th world youth day event begins , signs are already evident in cologne .
banners waving at many of the city 's churches and squares are announcing the event . accommodations are being sought everywhere for the hundreds of thousands expected to come - school vacations are being even extended because school buildings are needed to accommodate the young catholics arriving from 160 countries . new focus on nature the focus on the environment is something new .
the organizers have even encouraged german pilgrims and others from nearby countries to avoid planes and travel by train instead .
to this end , they had a deal with the german railways , which is offering a special world youth day special ticket for groups .
the city 's regional and local transport will also be discounted .
and even the rejection of a single opening ceremony in favor of three separate smaller opening services in cologne , bonn and düsseldorf , say organizers , is because they wanted to help protect the environment . but even these measures were not enough for organizers .
they needed a new innovation - and that 's where the dishes came in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a hill created for the pope for the closing ceremony of world youth day .
" i am holding a bowl , a pilgrim 's bowl in my hand , " said here .
" it is relatively easy to hold it in one 's hand , attractive , not too large but it is true that it is slower to eat with , especially when it contains little . " the bowl is n't just attractive or easy to hold , either . " the color is whitish beige and it looks a bit like paper , " said yvonne jülich , who works for the world youth day administration .
" one could imagine it sometimes falling apart .
and it even smells like paper . " the really special thing about the dishes and cutlery , though , and what makes them tolerable , is that they are made out of cornstarch and are biodegradable .
because of the special dishes , the trash pile at least will be smaller . " one gets used to it " and that is point .
" create conservation " was the guiding principle that organizers worked under in order to make the event eco-friendlier .
therefore , they decided early that they should only use recycled paper .
just for the programs for pilgrims , they used 250 tons of paper .
the conversion to recycled paper was not difficult at all , though , said jülich . " one gets used to it quickly , " she said .
" we were sad when we first saw it because white paper looks nice and this was a different color . but now we find it nice . " and participants wo n't be receiving drinks in plastic bottles , either .
instead , there will be water fountains where they can fill up their own bottles with drinking water .

gam , which belongs to swiss banking giant ubs , holds about 1.5 million hvb shares .
but fund manager john bennett told the business daily handelsblatt that gam believed unicredit 's bid price was too low .
the italian giant is offering five of its own shares for every hvb share held , effectively pricing hvb shares at 22 euros -lrb- $ 26.60 -rrb- a piece .
but bennett said the hvb shares were worth 25-27 euros each .
" we 're not going to sell under current conditions , " the fund manager told the newspaper .
gam is not the first hvb shareholder to criticize the terms of the offer .
austrian shareholder , the avz foundation , which holds a stake of four percent , was also critical , saying it would make a final decision whether to accept the offer in september .
nevertheless , most analysts believe shareholder resistance to the deal will not be strong enough to scupper it altogether . dw-world.de a bank merger with the east in mind the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
but it was the five time world champions who took the lead in the tenth minute with a fine moment of artistry from ronaldinho , who escaped kaji 's attentions and ran half the length of the pitch to feed robinho who had brilliantly slipped his marker , the 21-year-old striker angling his shot from the left past yoshikatsu kawaguchi . only kawaguchi 's right post prevented japan going further behind when a kaka rocket ricocheted off it soon after .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .
" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july . " weight on my conscience " and in october , klaus konrad , a former politician from the german social democrat party , took part in the torture and massacre of civilians while serving in the nazi forces retreating from italy in 1944 , according to television and press reports . in a documentary screened by the public tv service ard , konrad , who is now 89 , admitted that he had witnessed the torture and killing of italians in july 1944 at san polo , in the northern region of tuscany . in an interview with the daily corriere della sera newspaper , konrad however pleaded that he was only following orders , but admitted that " i have always felt a weight on my conscience " over the incidents . ard said at least 48 people were believed to have been massacred by the german forces , which were retreating from italy in the face of the allied advance from the south .
sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .

sixteen of those killed were believed to have been buried alive , the programme said . it also said that a german inquiry into the massacre , which was shelved in 1972 , could be reopened . a military prosecutor in the northern italian city of la spezia had examined documents relating to the accusations , and konrad could face charges as a result , the tv programme said . konrad , who was an army lieutenant in 1944 , went on to have a career as a member of parliament for the social democrats .

marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . italy wanted to avoid hunting nazis evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities , mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre . defense lawyers argued that soldiers had to carry out orders or face death . but prosecutors said that was irrelevant .
" it was premeditated , " said prosecutor marco de paolis to the court .
" obedience can not be blind . " the germans are unlikely to serve any jail time , since germany generally does not extradite its citizens . lastest nazi case it is just the latest case that raises the legacy of world war ii in italy . in december , an italian military court has acquitted a former nazi officer charged over the 1944 massacre of 60 people in an italian monastery where german troops found jews hiding , a judicial source said . hermann langer , 85 , was tried in absentia by the court in the northwestern town of spezia . the former ss lieutenant was found not guilty on friday of leading a group of soldiers who carried out the massacre on september 2 , 1944 , after they found jews hiding in farneta cistercian monastery near the town of lucca . a venezuelan bishop and several monks were among those killed , who included swiss , german , french and spanish nationals . prosecutors had called for a life sentence in the case which opened in july .

but its determined performance seems to have finally silenced the sceptics . the german media was in a more positive mood on wednesday as it reflected on germany 's 2-2 draw with argentina in the confederations cup match .
the draw sees germany reach the semi-finals as winner of group a , with argentina also qualifying for the last four as runner-up . " after the 90 minutes in nuremberg we know we do not need to hide from anyone , " declared mass-circulation daily bild . " we should not fear the favorites for the world cup as argentina crushed brazil 3-1 in the qualifying campaign . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sebastian deisler , left , runs clear of his teammate kevin kuranyi , center , who is held back by argentina 's juan sorin tuesday 's match at the 42,000-strong franken stadium in nuremberg saw brazilian-born german striker kevin kuranyi notch up the first goal in the 29th minute before argentinean midfielder and man of the match juan roman riquelme scored an equalizer with a blistering free kick minutes later .
gerald asamoah restored germany 's lead in the 51st minute and argentina 's esteban cambiasso leveled with a superb shot . german captain michael ballack was rested for the match with germany already having qualified for the semi-final .
but , coach jürgen klinsmann said the move was also aimed at encouraging more players to shoulder responsibility and was an indication that the team was n't too dependant on ballack . " national team shines without -lrb- michael -rrb- ballack , " said the respected frankfurter allgemeine daily . klinsmann , 40 , however insisted that the move did n't endanger the team 's performance .
" it was not a risk to rest ballack as we knew this side could do the job . " germany on a par with soccer heavyweights yet the job was not quite completed and the search for a win against a top nation goes on .
not since the 1-0 win over england in october 2000 has germany defeated a recognized top-ranked team . " germany made to wait for big win , " headlined daily berliner morgenpost .
" but klinsmann 's side can be proud of reaching the semi-finals as group winners after a determined display . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann however klinsmann put a positive spin on tuesday 's result .
" we have n't won against a heavyweight for at least five years but you can also see things differently : since we began in july 2004 -lrb- with klinsmann as coach -rrb- , we have n't lost against the big guns either . " assistant coach joachim löw agreed : " the big guns simply ca n't beat us anymore , " hinting that a year before the next world cup , germany was once again on a par with soccer greats argentina and brazil on its own turf even without captain ballack . even german soccer federation chief gerhard mayer-vorfelder was full of praise .
" one could see that it was possible even without ballack and that makes one a bit prouder , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's juan roman riquelme compliments rained in from rivals argentina , too .
coach jose pekerman said germany was difficult to play against while star midfielder riquelme called it a " great team . " still missing that extra touch but despite the bouquets , klinsmann was far from overrating his team 's performance and sober in his assessment of what the team still lacked to go for the kill .
" the last bit of determination and alertness was missing in crucial situations , " he said . perhaps we miss that extra touch of class against the top sides , " admitted midfielder bastian schweinsteiger .
" sometimes we need to use our heads more . " schweinsteiger will miss the semi-final after picking up a yellow card and must hope his team-mates can give him the opportunity to play in the final on june 29 in frankfurt . bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , kevin kuranyi and mike hanke world champion brazil is one possible opponent for germany , as are japan and mexico , but klinsmann prefers to face the big guns .

brazil will now face germany in the semi-finals . the result left the sides tied on four points in group b , with brazil 's better goal difference earning them the right to meet germany in nuremberg on saturday .
robinho and ronaldinho , wearing the captain 's armband , scored brazil 's goals with second half substitute masashi oguro getting a second half equalizer after shunsuke nakamura 's first half effort .
there was a touching scene before kick-off when ronaldinho , kaka and juan came up and hugged zico , followed by the brazil team doctor who used to look after the 1980s brazil superstar in his playing days for flamengo . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira kept his word and made four changes to the side - introducing marcos in goal and a new backline of bayer leverkusen 's juan and leo to replace dida , roque junior and gilberto , with arsenal 's gilberto silva coming on for emerson in midfield .
zico kept faith with strikers keji tamada and atsushi yanagisawa despite the duo misfiring badly against greece . " i had two targets in germany , " said parreira .
" the first was to use 20 players in three matches - the second was to qualify for the semi-finals .
we knew japan were going to give us a hard time , they are a very experienced team , they never give up . " in a frenetic start brazil could have been a goal down in the fourth minute when akira kaji 's shot slipped under marcos only for the fc tokyo defender to be ruled offside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's robinho , left , slots the opening goal past japan 's goalkeeper yoshikatsu kawaguchi to score the opening goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
but it was the five time world champions who took the lead in the tenth minute with a fine moment of artistry from ronaldinho , who escaped kaji 's attentions and ran half the length of the pitch to feed robinho who had brilliantly slipped his marker , the 21-year-old striker angling his shot from the left past yoshikatsu kawaguchi . only kawaguchi 's right post prevented japan going further behind when a kaka rocket ricocheted off it soon after .
the crossbar at the other end was responsible for denying a header from kaji off mitsuo ogasawura 's free kick as the asian champions ' pace began to nettle the brazilians . japan equalizes then on 27 minutes they got a deserved equalizer with marcos only getting his fingertips to nakamura 's shot after an attack which had its origins in a hidetoshi nakata-taken free kick . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , challenges brazil 's ronaldinho during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany , wednesday , june 22 , 2005 .
ronaldinho restored brazil 's supremacy when robinho crossed from the left for the barcelona star to slide the ball in from in front of goal in the 32nd minute . the second half was barely born when nakamura had his head in his hands after a point-blank effort saved by marcos - up at the other end only kawaguchi 's bravery kept the ball from going in when the former portsmouth keeper took the full force of juan 's shot in his face . adriano , having an off day , made way for julio baptista with kaka replaced by baptista 's seville teammate renato on the hour mark and shortly after there was another new face on the pitch belonging to the brazilian fan who breached the tight security cordon . he ran up to ronaldinho before jumping into the japan goal 's netting , five security guards in hot pursuit in the third incident of this nature at the 2005 confed cup which will give organizers cause for concern ahead of next year 's world cup . bildunterschrift : japan 's shunsuke nakamura , left , hits a free kick over the brazilian wall during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and japan in cologne , germany wednesday june 22 , 2005 .
the free kick hit a post and from the rebound masashi oguro scored japan 's equalizer . japan had the last word when oguro repeated his feat against greece and scored the late leveller after a beautiful free kick over the wall by nakamura hit the post .
all oguro had to do was sink the rebound . " i 'm pleased with my freekick but disappointed we have n't qualified , " said nakamura , who was named man-of-the-match . soccer gods brazil nearly suffered a massive upset when in the match 's waning seconds , japan nearly scored again .
only a save by keeper marcos kept the world champions from going home early . mexico tops group b mexico will face argentina in the semi-finals of the confederations cup after a 0-0 draw against greece in the other group b match on wednesday .
the scoreless draw , the first of the tournament so far , helps mexico stretch their unbeaten run to 21 games . mexico won the competition in their homeland back in 1999 and if they can continue their unbeaten run for two more games the trophy will be theirs again . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sways critics with resolute play confederations cup host germany is n't resting on its laurels after its 2-2 draw against soccer heavyweight argentina on tuesday .

concerns in western countries that immigrant numbers are spiraling out of control , causing job loss and hikes in welfare spending , are wrong , the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said wednesday . the iom said the world 's estimated 185-192 million migrants - up from 175 million in 2000 - boost the economies of their new countries and the homelands they leave behind , although it did concede that the impact of the brain drain on poor nations was cause for concern . " we are living in an increasingly globalized world which can no longer depend on domestic labor markets alone .
this is a reality that has to be managed , " said iom director general brunson mckinley . " if managed properly , migration can bring more benefits than costs , " mckinley told reporters at the launch of the 2005 world migration report . filling the gaps focusing on western europe , where many studies have highlighted a need to fill gaps caused by low birth rates , the iom said direct competition between migrants and local workers is rare .
migrants are concentrated at the higher and lower ends of the employment market , often in jobs the locals are either unable or unwilling to do , said the iom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iom says many countries need proper immigration policies they can also generate billions of dollars for government coffers , with their taxes outweighing welfare payments .
however , many governments , particularly in europe , are still failing to get to grips with the need for proper immigration policies , said the iom . immigration debate flares in germany the report comes at a time when germany looks set to deepen its own debate on immigration .
recent comments from bavaria 's csu interior minister günther beckstein , who is tipped to become the next interior minister should the conservatives win the planned september elections , leave a big question mark over the way a new government would deal with the issue . bildunterschrift : migration commissioner marieluise beck beckstein told voters they could choose between the plans of the ruling coalition to massively increase immigration , or vote for his party and a policy " without immigration . " but federal migration commissioner marieluise beck -lrb- photo -rrb- said beckstein was out of step with the reality of the situation .
the number of migrants coming to germany has in fact been declining since 2002 , and last year for example , the german authorities received just 35,000 asylum requests compared to 50,000 in 2003 . russia and the us are top spots germany is home to a total of 7.3 million migrants , third in place after the united states , which is home to 35 million , and russia , where 13.3 million migrants are permanently resident .
most of them left other republics of the former soviet union after 1991 . the top migrant sending countries are china , india and the philippines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers can help their home economies in absentia migrants are a key source of income for many poorer countries .
the iom study said they officially sent home $ 100 billion -lrb- 820 million euros -rrb- in 2004 , adding that another 100 billion dollars is thought to flow home through informal channels .
top of the list for remittances is mexico , followed by india , the philippines , egypt and morocco . but migration on the scale it exists also means a loss of skilled people essential for domestic development in poorer countries .
estimates suggest that some 400,000 scientists and engineers from developing countries work in industrialized nations , compared with 1.2 million at home , the report said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : a german amnesty for illegal immigrants ?

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- caribbean call to resume whaling bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 22 june , 2005 , 05:01 gmt 06:01 uk caribbean call to resume whaling by richard black bbc environment correspondent in ulsan , south korea caribbean and african delegates to the international whaling commission meeting have told the bbc they would like to begin commercial whaling .
commercial hunts have been banned for nearly 20 years and caribbean and african nations often urge a lifting of the moratorium at annual gatherings .
they are frequently accused of siding with japan , leader of the pro-whaling bloc , as a return for foreign aid .
but three caribbean delegates say the accusation is nonsense .
" we would welcome the lifting of the moratorium , " said lloyd pascal , whaling commissioner for dominica .
" this is a creature like all others that people depend upon for food , and therefore because of its abundance we think that we can take a limited amount and make some money out of it . "
working quotas his view is that stocks of some whales are large enough that hunting can now be sustainable .
colin murdoch , the alternate -lrb- or deputy -rrb- commissioner for antigua and barbuda , told bbc news that a resumption of whaling would open up new opportunities for local fishermen . "
the key point is that if commercial whaling is resumed , then countries in the caribbean would be given a quota " daven joseph , st kitts and nevis delegation " we 're already encouraging them to move away from the traditional inshore fisheries and to go for pelagic -lrb- open-water -rrb- species , " he said .
" apart from local consumption , there is the issue of export , and we have guadeloupe nearby which can be a gateway to france , for example . "
daven joseph , from the st kitts and nevis delegation , had a slightly different slant on the issue .
" the key point is that if commercial whaling is resumed , then countries in the caribbean would be given a quota , " he told bbc news . "
the caribbean does not need whale meat in order to solve food security problems - no-one does " leah garcês , world society for the protection of animals " even though we might not catch whales ourselves , we could then sell the quota , like we do our tuna quota under iccat -lrb- the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tuna -rrb- . "
at iwc meetings , caribbean nations are traditionally joined in their support for pro-whaling motions by african developing countries .
one delegate from a west african country , speaking off the record , told me his government also wanted to be allowed to catch whales as a food source .
polarised views for the caribbean delegates , there is a link between their enthusiasm for whaling and issues of global trade - particularly the mandate of the world trade organization , and removal of traditionally favourable export terms .
" we were a country that did what we could with our export of bananas ; other countries in the caribbean exported sugar , " said dominica 's lloyd pascal .
" but what we found is that belonging to the world trade organization , certain objections were taken to our preferential treatment , and this has resulted in a net loss of earnings for our country .
" this has caused our country to reach a stage where we are now under a structural adjustment programme with the international monetary fund . "
this explanation for the caribbean and african delegates ' standpoints was rejected by leah garcês , campaigns director for the world society for the protection of animals .
" there 's no relationship between poverty , food problems and food security and whaling , " she told bbc news .
" the caribbean does not need whale meat in order to solve food security problems - no-one does .
" i think they 're trying to find ways of explaining why they 're supporting japan . "
whatever the reasons behind the caribbean support for commercial whaling , it seems extremely unlikely that their wish will be met within the foreseeable future .
a motion which could potentially have removed the moratorium was rejected on the second day of this conference ; as the third day began , it was unclear whether any further motions that could prise open the same door would be presented .
the iwc remains a deeply polarised body , with little compromise possible between two entrenched positions ; one that regards whales as a food resource like any other , and the other that sees them as special , sentient creatures which should never again be hunted .

the idea behind the system is to target government money at people when they most need it : in this case , families with young children , even if their parents have a job .
it gives money back to low and middle income families , in the form of tax credits , rather than handing out welfare benefits .
but , according to the citizen 's advice bureau , as many as one in three families have received overpayment - and , when the revenue claws the money back , it can cause extreme hardship .
and , the parliamentary ombudsman , who 's also been investigating family tax credit , is calling for the first two years ' overpayments to be written off altogether .
this morning , breakfast looked at the trouble with family tax credit .
we want to hear your experiences of the system : jump straight to our e-mail form we talked to families whose finances have been thrown into confusion we put some of your concerns to the government minister in charge of the system - the paymaster general dawn primarolo .
she told us she 's still considering whether to write off overpayments , as the ombudsman wants .
a recording of our full interview will be available shortly .
further details from bbc news online 's finance specialists over six million families and 10 million children are currently benefiting from tax credits but we take all complaints very seriously hm revenue & customs spokesperson more than half of overpayments made topped £ 500 .
cab 's damning report - based on 150,000 cases handled by the charity , - said that hmrc had " failed to live up to its own standards of information , clarity and efficiency of service " in the administration of tax credits .
one of the chief gripes reported to the cab was the overpayment of tax credits .
hmrc recently admitted that of £ 13.5bn paid out last year , £ 1.9bn consisted of overpayments .
cab said the " huge overpayments " were due to hmrc system failings .
appeal call instead of trying to claim back overpaid tax credits the charity called for an amnesty .
" in the light of the historic level of administration errors , more overpayments should be written off , " the report said .
in addition , cab called for better training for hmrc staff , better advice for claimants and a " proper independent right of appeal " against hmrc decisions .
meanwhile , in her report , parliamentary ombudsman ann abraham accused ms primarolo of failing to give accurate information when questioned about overpayments in the house of commons in february .
ms abrahams also said she was unable to say how many overpayments were due to government mistakes and how many were down to delays in claimants reporting a change in circumstances .
' sensible response ' but her report echoed cab 's call for an amnesty on the recovery of overpayments , particularly those caused by official errors in the first two years of the scheme .
in response to the claims in the cab report , hmrc told bbc news that technology problems had led to mistakes but that millions of families had benefited from tax credits .
" while there were much-publicised it and processing errors that occurred when the system was introduced two years ago , hmrc now has a new it partner and the system is stable , " an hmrc spokesperson said .
" over six million families and 10 million children are currently benefiting from tax credits , but we take all complaints very seriously and we 're committed to doing everything we can to reduce the number of complaints . "

at 297bn yen -lrb- $ 2.7bn ; £ 1.5bn -rrb- , it was down 68.3 % in may from a year earlier .
the decline - the fourth in five months - could have worrying implications for the japanese economy , traditionally heavily dependent on exports .
but although less was shipped to china , japan continued to expand its exports to the us .
the subdued export picture , which reinforces recent current account data , means japan is now relying more on domestic demand than has been the case in the past , economists said .
" the trade balance already hit a peak last year , " said nikko citigroup 's kiichi murashima .
" the big picture is that private consumption and investment are supporting growth in japan . "
energy pressures china and the us are by far the most significant overseas markets for japanese goods .
between them they account for more than a third of all exports with china , experiencing an investment-led boom , rapidly growing in importance in recent years .
but the government in beijing has for the past year been trying to take its economy off the boil .
that , economists said , was hitting demand for machinery and raw materials , while another factor could be anti-japan protests earlier this year , triggered by a textbook which chinese activists said refused to acknowledge atrocities committed by japanese troops during world war ii .
at the same time , energy costs have started to hurt japan , which has no indigenous hydrocarbon reserves .
crude oil prices are stuck above $ 50 a barrel and are now approaching $ 60 - driving the value of japan 's imports up 18.6 % from the previous year .

members of the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- will claim there are close to 2,000 nurse vacancies in wales , not 600 as quoted in official figures .
the body will state these claims in giving evidence to the welsh assembly 's health and social services committee on wednesday .
the assembly government has said nurse vacancy figures were falling .
other evidence due to be submitted by the rcn are claims that the cost of filling the gaps by using agency staff has risen by 117 % to £ 21m over three years .
following a survey of 10,000 members , the rcn found that one in nine nurses is planning to leave the profession soon .
the rcn will call on politicians to tackle recruitment and retention of nurses , as well as other issues which are affecting the nursing profession and patient care .
" the aim of individual nurses has always been to improve the health of patients , " said tina donnelly , the director of rcn wales .
" we are committed to contributing to the development of welsh health policy and the evidence we have submitted will focus the committee 's attention on the nursing issues that really matter to patients in wales , so that the patient experience is enhanced . "
filling nursing posts and tempting nurses who have left the profession to return to work has remained a challenge for the nhs in wales and the welsh assembly government .
a spokesperson for the welsh assembly government said : " while we share the royal college of nursing 's concern about nursing vacancies , it is nevertheless true to say that the nurse vacancy figure for the whole of wales is 2.2 % and falling .
" this means that 98 % of nursing vacancies have been filled here in wales .
" we agree that the number of agency staff working in the nhs is too high and we aim over time to turn these agency places into nursing positions . "

following a survey of 10,000 members , the rcn found that one in nine nurses is planning to leave the profession soon .
the rcn will call on politicians to tackle recruitment and retention of nurses , as well as other issues which are affecting the nursing profession and patient care .
the rcn says many are planning on leaving the profession " the aim of individual nurses has always been to improve the health of patients , " said tina donnelly , the director of rcn wales .
" we are committed to contributing to the development of welsh health policy and the evidence we have submitted will focus the committee 's attention on the nursing issues that really matter to patients in wales , so that the patient experience is enhanced . "
filling nursing posts and tempting nurses who have left the profession to return to work has remained a challenge for the nhs in wales and the welsh assembly government .
a spokesperson for the welsh assembly government said : " while we share the royal college of nursing 's concern about nursing vacancies , it is nevertheless true to say that the nurse vacancy figure for the whole of wales is 2.2 % and falling .
" this means that 98 % of nursing vacancies have been filled here in wales .
" we agree that the number of agency staff working in the nhs is too high and we aim over time to turn these agency places into nursing positions . "
