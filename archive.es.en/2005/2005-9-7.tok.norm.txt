a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .

the nato-lead international forces continue to play a key role ensuring safety and stability . the importance of the afghan parliamentary and regional elections , less than one year after the presidential poll , has not gone unnoticed in the international community .
berlin has donated $ 3 million -lrb- 2.4 million euros -rrb- to the united nations fund to help defray the costs of organizing the vote .
seventy election observers , including six representatives from germany , have already been dispatched to afghanistan .
by election day , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will have 140 observers in place , supported by some 7,000 afghan helpers .
the elections in afghanistan remain , nonetheless , a hazardous matter .
the european union has already declared four of 34 provinces too dangerous to send election monitors .
so far , four afghan candidates have been assassinated , while islamic militants , mostly ousted taliban militia , have vowed to disrupt voting .

the german army did not send additional troops , since it already has 2,230 soldiers in afghanistan - twenty soldiers fewer than the maximum number authorized by the german parliament .
most of the german soldiers are stationed in kabul , but a smaller contingent of 450 troops is in the north of afghanistan .

" with parliament 's permission , we would also be allowed to extend our mission to the west of the country , if requested , " he said .
time constraints in germany changes in the german contingent will not occur before elections on sept .

this will happen in mid-september , at the earliest .

bildunterschrift : a convoy of german armoured vehicles from isaf defense affairs spokesman christian schmidt of the opposition csu criticized the timetable as " adventurous , " but all other parties agreed that they wanted to wait for the presentation of the un draft mandate before taking up the matter .

seventy election observers , including six representatives from germany , have already been dispatched to afghanistan .

18 .
the nato-lead international forces continue to play a key role ensuring safety and stability . the importance of the afghan parliamentary and regional elections , less than one year after the presidential poll , has not gone unnoticed in the international community .
berlin has donated $ 3 million -lrb- 2.4 million euros -rrb- to the united nations fund to help defray the costs of organizing the vote .
seventy election observers , including six representatives from germany , have already been dispatched to afghanistan .
by election day , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will have 140 observers in place , supported by some 7,000 afghan helpers .
the elections in afghanistan remain , nonetheless , a hazardous matter .
the european union has already declared four of 34 provinces too dangerous to send election monitors .
so far , four afghan candidates have been assassinated , while islamic militants , mostly ousted taliban militia , have vowed to disrupt voting .
isaf playing key role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck -lrb- left -rrb- together with colonel reinhard burz in kunduz last october the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has stocked up its forces in kabul and other areas in the country by 2,000 , thus increasing the number of troops that will be present before , during and after the election to 11,000 .
the german army did not send additional troops , since it already has 2,230 soldiers in afghanistan - twenty soldiers fewer than the maximum number authorized by the german parliament .
most of the german soldiers are stationed in kabul , but a smaller contingent of 450 troops is in the north of afghanistan .

" with parliament 's permission , we would also be allowed to extend our mission to the west of the country , if requested , " he said .
time constraints in germany changes in the german contingent will not occur before elections on sept .

the un must first approve the continuation of the international community 's role in afghanistan .
this will happen in mid-september , at the earliest .
in addition , the new german parliamentarians may not yet be in berlin before the afghanistan mandate expires on oct .
13 , which means that the outgoing german parliament may have to address this issue even after the german elections .
bildunterschrift : a convoy of german armoured vehicles from isaf defense affairs spokesman christian schmidt of the opposition csu criticized the timetable as " adventurous , " but all other parties agreed that they wanted to wait for the presentation of the un draft mandate before taking up the matter .
there is a consensus among german politicians that the situation in afghanistan is too unstable to have isaf removed in the near future . nina werkhäuser -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every soldier is aware of that risk " after a blast which killed two german soldiers in northern afghanistan last weekend , dw-world spoke with a german military official stationed in kunduz about the duties and dangers of peacekeeping .

by offering something for everyone , organizers hope the event can keep its reputation as the " mother of all literary festivals . " germany is not lacking in literary festivals .
leipzig reads , litcologne , and the aachen storytelling festival are three of the bigger ones . but the jewel in the crown of the german literary season is the international literature festival berlin , or ilb . as festivals go , the ilb certainly does n't lack for ambition . more than 100 authors will take part in 300 separate events over the course of 12 days .
these include book and poetry readings , author appearances and political discussions , in dozens of sites throughout the city . in 2004 , organizers said that they hosted 35,500 visitors ; they are expecting a similar number this year .
that may be smaller than the international book festival in edinburgh , which had had 220,000 visitors , 500 authors and 650 events over two weeks this year .
but it is still a huge undertaking , with a large turnout . international , political the festival has two main sections , literatures of the world and kaleidescope .
the literatures of the world invitees were nominated by a jury of well known authors .
with writers coming from every continent , this section fo the festival seems likely to live up to its name .
kaleidescope authors were invited expressly by the festival organizers , and the focus is on literature that deals with current cultural and political developments.their appearances are supported by an international network of sponsors and friends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drowning in literature while some people say reading is a dying art , the ilb apparently sees things differently . the international children ’ s and youth literature program has diverse readings and exhibitions for kids , while the scritture giovani project encourages young european authors . for 2005 , scritture giovani - a cooperation between several large european literary festivals - has asked five young authors from different countries to write a short story on the theme of “ elsewhere . ”
these will be presented at various literature festivals , and later published in a single , five-language volume . spotlight on california every year , the festival highlights a geographic region .
this time , california is in the spotlight . moving away from the clichés of hippies , hollywood and schwarzenegger , the show wants to offer a overview of the literary life of the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california expert kevin starr " if america did n't have california , the psyche of the nation would be different , " said kevin starr , a historian who has written about the state and is known as california 's " living archives . " an important force in american creativity would be lost , then . " another guest of the festival is steve wasserman , former features editor of the los angeles times , a well-known intellectual and pulizer prize juror .
he complained before the festival that too few us newspapers publish book reviews or news about literature . " it is one of the big scandals of american journalism … we are failing our readers , " he said .
the festival runs until sept .

this time , british prime minister tony blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .

cdu leader and frontrunner for chancellor in germany 's upcoming general election angela merkel has hinted in the past that she would pursue nuclear technology export deals with both india and china , where atomic energy is a booming industry . schäuble 's comments drew criticism from germany 's free-market liberal party , the fdp , as well as environmentalists , who point to the fact that india engaged in controversial weapons testing in 1998 and has never signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . the fdp 's parliamentary leader wolfgang gerhardt warned that supplying india with nuclear technology would only serve to " strengthen the iranians , " at a time when the eu is struggling to convince iran to abandon its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimistic india meets pessimistic germany as german industry begins to wake up to the endless opportunities in the vast expanse of india , indian companies are slowly but surely tapping into germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 07.09.2005 us policy at fault for katrina ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush has received severe criticism for his handling of the disaster .
a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .
though it is hard to predict the outcome of a hurricane , the armchair quarterbacks are now having a field day as to what went wrong and how it should have been done .
all we can do now is learn and get help to all of our citizens in need as quickly as possible .
and really plan for a future hurricane strike , for it 's just a matter of time before the next one strikes .
the biggest disappointment was our neighbor to the north , canada .
it took them four days to even call our president to offer some help .
if the tables were turned i know we would have been at the border asking what can we do to help .
such is life . - werner , charleston , usa compiled by dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?
hurricane katrina has devastated large parts of new orleans and the adjacent gulf coast region .
dw-world readers comment on the disaster .
-lrb- sept .
2 , 2005 -rrb- germany prepared to help the us while us emergency teams are working around the clock in the mostly submerged city of new orleans , the german government , although highly critical of us environmental policies , is offering its help .
-lrb- sept .
1 , 2005 -rrb- aid pouring into us from abroad aid from around the world is streaming to the united states in the wake of hurricane katrina .
george w. bush has had his hands full in managing the clean-up but has also taken time to thank those who have helped .
-lrb- sept .

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .
though it is hard to predict the outcome of a hurricane , the armchair quarterbacks are now having a field day as to what went wrong and how it should have been done .
all we can do now is learn and get help to all of our citizens in need as quickly as possible .
and really plan for a future hurricane strike , for it 's just a matter of time before the next one strikes .
the biggest disappointment was our neighbor to the north , canada .
it took them four days to even call our president to offer some help .
if the tables were turned i know we would have been at the border asking what can we do to help .
such is life . - werner , charleston , usa compiled by dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .

still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .

i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .

people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?

the motto of the beethoven festival in 2005 is liberté . the beethoven festival in bonn may have dropped the " international " from its name , but its scope and line-up certainly remain so .
under the patronage of german president horst köhler , the sixty-four events and additional side events will take place from september 8 until october 2 at twenty-five locations in bonn , the city where ludwig van beethoven was born , as well as in the picturesque surrounding regions on the river rhine .
with the motto bohemia , last year ’ s festival looked towards the east .
in 2005 the motto is liberté , turning the focus to the west , or to be more precise , to france and its rich cultural heritage .
festival director ilona schmiel on the motto : " liberté is a key word of the french revolution .
there are many historical connections , including the two hundredth anniversary of friedrich schiller ’ s death in 1805 as well as the first performance of " fidelio " .
we will embark on a voyage through time to encounter the revolutionary ideas and music that had a great effect on beethoven , and we will present it to all visitors in a grand context .
one highlight is certainly the orchestre national de france with kurt masur and an all-french program .
we also have jean-yves thibaudet , lise de la salle , helène grimaud and of course the new york philharmonic with lorin maazel , but also a grand master of the calibre of alfred brendel . "
tradition and modernism ludwig van beethoven lived during the age of enlightenment .
this was a time of revolutionary ideas and social upheaval .
it was also the era when the first orchestras and music societies for middle-class citizens were founded .
but the beethoven festival is not primarily a museum of music history , as this year 's line-up includes eight newly commissioned works .
of course , much beethoven will be heard as well , including several cycles .
his thirty-two piano sonatas will be played by garrick ohlsson , andreas staier , louis lortie and bernd glemser .
in two recitals , the beaux arts trio will perform beethoven 's complete piano trios .
the programme also includes all of beethoven 's late string quartets .
on that subject : building on last year 's experience of the " long night of the pianos , " this time a " long night of the string quartets " will be a big attraction .
and on september the 25th , two hundred years to the day after the premiere of " fidelio " .
beethoven 's only opera will be staged at the bonn opera house in a new production by director günter krämer .
fostering young talent ! the orchestral campus , a collaboration with deutsche welle as media and co-partner of the beethoven festival , enters its fifth year in 2005 .
after ukraine , turkey , georgia and china in past seasons , this time the invitation went to an outstanding youth orchestra from poland .
coinciding with the current german-polish year 2005-2006 , the orchestra of the krakow music academy will be coming to bonn .
one of the highlights of this programme will be the world première of a work by the young polish composer agata zubel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2005 helping scientists juggle kids and career großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist nüsslein-volhard : " a good researcher can not be replaced " women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .
a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .
political issues indeed , politicians have spent the past few years grappling with issues such as all-day schools and expanded daycare for small children .
compared with most other european countries , germany is considered unfriendly toward working mothers on these topics .
over the past decade , the scientific community has worked hard to address the imbalances . mentoring programs have mushroomed , while federal and local monies have been directed into programs aimed at helping women in the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german science ca n't afford losing talented women these measures have met with some success .
the numbers of female science professors have been growing over the last decade , and there are now more women professors than at any time in the country 's history . so far , though , the nüsslein-vollhard foundation has been the first to try to achieve parity by financing household appliances . lost opportunity cews ' lind says it 's important to realize promoting women 's role in science is a question of equal opportunity , but also much more than that .
" there are profound reasons to continue increasing the number of women professors , " lind said .
" on the one hand , greater input from women ... would give a different perspective to science , " she said , noting recent acknowledgement of a longstanding ' male bias ’ in pharmaceutical and medical research .
financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .
for germany , " the loss of highly qualified scientists leads to a shrinking pool of human resources that german science can ’ t afford in the long run .
not if it wants to stay internationally competitive .

by offering something for everyone , organizers hope the event can keep its reputation as the " mother of all literary festivals . " germany is not lacking in literary festivals .
leipzig reads , litcologne , and the aachen storytelling festival are three of the bigger ones . but the jewel in the crown of the german literary season is the international literature festival berlin , or ilb . as festivals go , the ilb certainly does n't lack for ambition . more than 100 authors will take part in 300 separate events over the course of 12 days .
these include book and poetry readings , author appearances and political discussions , in dozens of sites throughout the city . in 2004 , organizers said that they hosted 35,500 visitors ; they are expecting a similar number this year .
that may be smaller than the international book festival in edinburgh , which had had 220,000 visitors , 500 authors and 650 events over two weeks this year .
but it is still a huge undertaking , with a large turnout . international , political the festival has two main sections , literatures of the world and kaleidescope .
the literatures of the world invitees were nominated by a jury of well known authors .
with writers coming from every continent , this section fo the festival seems likely to live up to its name .
kaleidescope authors were invited expressly by the festival organizers , and the focus is on literature that deals with current cultural and political developments.their appearances are supported by an international network of sponsors and friends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drowning in literature while some people say reading is a dying art , the ilb apparently sees things differently . the international children ’ s and youth literature program has diverse readings and exhibitions for kids , while the scritture giovani project encourages young european authors . for 2005 , scritture giovani - a cooperation between several large european literary festivals - has asked five young authors from different countries to write a short story on the theme of “ elsewhere . ”
these will be presented at various literature festivals , and later published in a single , five-language volume . spotlight on california every year , the festival highlights a geographic region .
this time , california is in the spotlight . moving away from the clichés of hippies , hollywood and schwarzenegger , the show wants to offer a overview of the literary life of the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california expert kevin starr " if america did n't have california , the psyche of the nation would be different , " said kevin starr , a historian who has written about the state and is known as california 's " living archives . " an important force in american creativity would be lost , then . " another guest of the festival is steve wasserman , former features editor of the los angeles times , a well-known intellectual and pulizer prize juror .

britain urged the european union on wednesday to toughen up its fight against terrorism , and reassess its human rights laws that prevent the deportation of suspected terrorists . british home secretary charles clarke urged eu officials on wednesday to reevaluate the balance between human rights and security in the age of global terrorism . it is now necessary " to balance these very important rights for individuals against the collective right for security against those who attack us through terrorist violence , " clarke told members of the european parliament .
" i have concluded that the balance now is not right and that it needs to be closely examined in the heightened threat that we now face . " the appeal by the eu 's current british presidency came ahead of a two-day meeting of eu justice and interior ministers which starts thursday in newcastle-upon-tyne , northern england . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clarke -lrb- right -rrb- says tougher measures critical " it is our duty to promote the view that democracy and not violence is the means of making change , " he said .
" we have to defend our values of respect , tolerance , freedom and democracy against any who wish to destroy or replace them with some other doctrine , particularly if they seek to use violence to promote their ambition . " human rights lobby concerned prime minister tony blair 's government launched a crackdown on islamic fundamentalism in the wake of the july 7 attacks on london transportation system that left 56 people dead , including four apparent suicide bombers . but some of the proposed measures , such as deporting so-called preachers of hate - even to countries with a reputation for torture - have raised serious concerns from the human rights lobby and civil liberties campaigners . in addition , clarke encouraged eu nations to share intelligence on terrorism and organized crime , noting that countries should agree common standards on using technology such as biometric data . clarke 's comments will fuel a debate on the content of the european convention of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , which prevents the deportation of a foreign terrorist suspect if the person could be put at risk of torture . a decisive battle eu justice commissioner franco frattini also underlined the need to give no quarter to terrorists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be balanced with security concerns , frattini says " failure to meet the challenges facing us is simply unthinkable , " he said .
" after ny , after madrid , after london we must respond to expectations that the -lrb- eu -rrb- act with authority and determination on the world stage .
we are engaged in a battle which will be long and decisive . " he cautioned , nonetheless , that a balance needs to be reached . " we should never be tired to repeat that when working on security we have to keep a balance between law enforcement activities and the protection of other fundamental rights , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the next targets ?

a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .

but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .

" there are profound reasons to continue increasing the number of women professors , " lind said .
" on the one hand , greater input from women ... would give a different perspective to science , " she said , noting recent acknowledgement of a longstanding ' male bias ’ in pharmaceutical and medical research .
financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2005 helping scientists juggle kids and career großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist nüsslein-volhard : " a good researcher can not be replaced " women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .
a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .
political issues indeed , politicians have spent the past few years grappling with issues such as all-day schools and expanded daycare for small children .
compared with most other european countries , germany is considered unfriendly toward working mothers on these topics .

" there are profound reasons to continue increasing the number of women professors , " lind said .
" on the one hand , greater input from women ... would give a different perspective to science , " she said , noting recent acknowledgement of a longstanding ' male bias ’ in pharmaceutical and medical research .
financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .
for germany , " the loss of highly qualified scientists leads to a shrinking pool of human resources that german science can ’ t afford in the long run .

a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .

a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.09.2005 berlin festival tops literary calendar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature taking center stage berlin 's international literature festival kicked off this week .
by offering something for everyone , organizers hope the event can keep its reputation as the " mother of all literary festivals . " germany is not lacking in literary festivals .
leipzig reads , litcologne , and the aachen storytelling festival are three of the bigger ones . but the jewel in the crown of the german literary season is the international literature festival berlin , or ilb . as festivals go , the ilb certainly does n't lack for ambition . more than 100 authors will take part in 300 separate events over the course of 12 days .
these include book and poetry readings , author appearances and political discussions , in dozens of sites throughout the city . in 2004 , organizers said that they hosted 35,500 visitors ; they are expecting a similar number this year .
that may be smaller than the international book festival in edinburgh , which had had 220,000 visitors , 500 authors and 650 events over two weeks this year .
but it is still a huge undertaking , with a large turnout . international , political the festival has two main sections , literatures of the world and kaleidescope .
the literatures of the world invitees were nominated by a jury of well known authors .
with writers coming from every continent , this section fo the festival seems likely to live up to its name .
kaleidescope authors were invited expressly by the festival organizers , and the focus is on literature that deals with current cultural and political developments.their appearances are supported by an international network of sponsors and friends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drowning in literature while some people say reading is a dying art , the ilb apparently sees things differently . the international children ’ s and youth literature program has diverse readings and exhibitions for kids , while the scritture giovani project encourages young european authors . for 2005 , scritture giovani - a cooperation between several large european literary festivals - has asked five young authors from different countries to write a short story on the theme of “ elsewhere . ”
these will be presented at various literature festivals , and later published in a single , five-language volume . spotlight on california every year , the festival highlights a geographic region .
this time , california is in the spotlight . moving away from the clichés of hippies , hollywood and schwarzenegger , the show wants to offer a overview of the literary life of the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california expert kevin starr " if america did n't have california , the psyche of the nation would be different , " said kevin starr , a historian who has written about the state and is known as california 's " living archives . " an important force in american creativity would be lost , then . " another guest of the festival is steve wasserman , former features editor of the los angeles times , a well-known intellectual and pulizer prize juror .
he complained before the festival that too few us newspapers publish book reviews or news about literature . " it is one of the big scandals of american journalism … we are failing our readers , " he said .
the festival runs until sept .

the nato-lead international forces continue to play a key role ensuring safety and stability . the importance of the afghan parliamentary and regional elections , less than one year after the presidential poll , has not gone unnoticed in the international community .
berlin has donated $ 3 million -lrb- 2.4 million euros -rrb- to the united nations fund to help defray the costs of organizing the vote .
seventy election observers , including six representatives from germany , have already been dispatched to afghanistan .
by election day , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will have 140 observers in place , supported by some 7,000 afghan helpers .
the elections in afghanistan remain , nonetheless , a hazardous matter .
the european union has already declared four of 34 provinces too dangerous to send election monitors .
so far , four afghan candidates have been assassinated , while islamic militants , mostly ousted taliban militia , have vowed to disrupt voting .
isaf playing key role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck -lrb- left -rrb- together with colonel reinhard burz in kunduz last october the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has stocked up its forces in kabul and other areas in the country by 2,000 , thus increasing the number of troops that will be present before , during and after the election to 11,000 .
the german army did not send additional troops , since it already has 2,230 soldiers in afghanistan - twenty soldiers fewer than the maximum number authorized by the german parliament .
most of the german soldiers are stationed in kabul , but a smaller contingent of 450 troops is in the north of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police trainer in front of afghan recruits if the german forces should be bumped up to 3,000 in the near future .
german defense minister struck also wants to eliminate the current geographical restrictions on bundeswehr soldiers .

" with parliament 's permission , we would also be allowed to extend our mission to the west of the country , if requested , " he said .
time constraints in germany changes in the german contingent will not occur before elections on sept .

the un must first approve the continuation of the international community 's role in afghanistan .
this will happen in mid-september , at the earliest .
in addition , the new german parliamentarians may not yet be in berlin before the afghanistan mandate expires on oct .

the motto of the beethoven festival in 2005 is liberté . the beethoven festival in bonn may have dropped the " international " from its name , but its scope and line-up certainly remain so .
under the patronage of german president horst köhler , the sixty-four events and additional side events will take place from september 8 until october 2 at twenty-five locations in bonn , the city where ludwig van beethoven was born , as well as in the picturesque surrounding regions on the river rhine .
with the motto bohemia , last year ’ s festival looked towards the east .
in 2005 the motto is liberté , turning the focus to the west , or to be more precise , to france and its rich cultural heritage .

there are many historical connections , including the two hundredth anniversary of friedrich schiller ’ s death in 1805 as well as the first performance of " fidelio " .
we will embark on a voyage through time to encounter the revolutionary ideas and music that had a great effect on beethoven , and we will present it to all visitors in a grand context .
one highlight is certainly the orchestre national de france with kurt masur and an all-french program .

in two recitals , the beaux arts trio will perform beethoven 's complete piano trios .

a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .
political issues indeed , politicians have spent the past few years grappling with issues such as all-day schools and expanded daycare for small children .
compared with most other european countries , germany is considered unfriendly toward working mothers on these topics .
over the past decade , the scientific community has worked hard to address the imbalances . mentoring programs have mushroomed , while federal and local monies have been directed into programs aimed at helping women in the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german science ca n't afford losing talented women these measures have met with some success .
the numbers of female science professors have been growing over the last decade , and there are now more women professors than at any time in the country 's history . so far , though , the nüsslein-vollhard foundation has been the first to try to achieve parity by financing household appliances . lost opportunity cews ' lind says it 's important to realize promoting women 's role in science is a question of equal opportunity , but also much more than that .
" there are profound reasons to continue increasing the number of women professors , " lind said .
" on the one hand , greater input from women ... would give a different perspective to science , " she said , noting recent acknowledgement of a longstanding ' male bias ’ in pharmaceutical and medical research .
financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .
for germany , " the loss of highly qualified scientists leads to a shrinking pool of human resources that german science can ’ t afford in the long run .
not if it wants to stay internationally competitive .

many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .
political issues indeed , politicians have spent the past few years grappling with issues such as all-day schools and expanded daycare for small children .
compared with most other european countries , germany is considered unfriendly toward working mothers on these topics .
over the past decade , the scientific community has worked hard to address the imbalances . mentoring programs have mushroomed , while federal and local monies have been directed into programs aimed at helping women in the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german science ca n't afford losing talented women these measures have met with some success .
the numbers of female science professors have been growing over the last decade , and there are now more women professors than at any time in the country 's history . so far , though , the nüsslein-vollhard foundation has been the first to try to achieve parity by financing household appliances . lost opportunity cews ' lind says it 's important to realize promoting women 's role in science is a question of equal opportunity , but also much more than that .
" there are profound reasons to continue increasing the number of women professors , " lind said .
" on the one hand , greater input from women ... would give a different perspective to science , " she said , noting recent acknowledgement of a longstanding ' male bias ’ in pharmaceutical and medical research .
financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .
for germany , " the loss of highly qualified scientists leads to a shrinking pool of human resources that german science can ’ t afford in the long run .
not if it wants to stay internationally competitive .

the motto of the beethoven festival in 2005 is liberté . the beethoven festival in bonn may have dropped the " international " from its name , but its scope and line-up certainly remain so .
under the patronage of german president horst köhler , the sixty-four events and additional side events will take place from september 8 until october 2 at twenty-five locations in bonn , the city where ludwig van beethoven was born , as well as in the picturesque surrounding regions on the river rhine .
with the motto bohemia , last year ’ s festival looked towards the east .
in 2005 the motto is liberté , turning the focus to the west , or to be more precise , to france and its rich cultural heritage .
festival director ilona schmiel on the motto : " liberté is a key word of the french revolution .
there are many historical connections , including the two hundredth anniversary of friedrich schiller ’ s death in 1805 as well as the first performance of " fidelio " .
we will embark on a voyage through time to encounter the revolutionary ideas and music that had a great effect on beethoven , and we will present it to all visitors in a grand context .
one highlight is certainly the orchestre national de france with kurt masur and an all-french program .
we also have jean-yves thibaudet , lise de la salle , helène grimaud and of course the new york philharmonic with lorin maazel , but also a grand master of the calibre of alfred brendel . "
tradition and modernism ludwig van beethoven lived during the age of enlightenment .
this was a time of revolutionary ideas and social upheaval .
it was also the era when the first orchestras and music societies for middle-class citizens were founded .
but the beethoven festival is not primarily a museum of music history , as this year 's line-up includes eight newly commissioned works .
of course , much beethoven will be heard as well , including several cycles .
his thirty-two piano sonatas will be played by garrick ohlsson , andreas staier , louis lortie and bernd glemser .
in two recitals , the beaux arts trio will perform beethoven 's complete piano trios .
the programme also includes all of beethoven 's late string quartets .
on that subject : building on last year 's experience of the " long night of the pianos , " this time a " long night of the string quartets " will be a big attraction .
and on september the 25th , two hundred years to the day after the premiere of " fidelio " .
beethoven 's only opera will be staged at the bonn opera house in a new production by director günter krämer .
fostering young talent ! the orchestral campus , a collaboration with deutsche welle as media and co-partner of the beethoven festival , enters its fifth year in 2005 .
after ukraine , turkey , georgia and china in past seasons , this time the invitation went to an outstanding youth orchestra from poland .
coinciding with the current german-polish year 2005-2006 , the orchestra of the krakow music academy will be coming to bonn .
one of the highlights of this programme will be the world première of a work by the young polish composer agata zubel .
arts.21 will be presenting her in a portrait , just as we introduced the winners of the deutsche welle composition prize of the last two years who came from china and georgia .

the nato-lead international forces continue to play a key role ensuring safety and stability . the importance of the afghan parliamentary and regional elections , less than one year after the presidential poll , has not gone unnoticed in the international community .
berlin has donated $ 3 million -lrb- 2.4 million euros -rrb- to the united nations fund to help defray the costs of organizing the vote .
seventy election observers , including six representatives from germany , have already been dispatched to afghanistan .
by election day , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will have 140 observers in place , supported by some 7,000 afghan helpers .
the elections in afghanistan remain , nonetheless , a hazardous matter .
the european union has already declared four of 34 provinces too dangerous to send election monitors .
so far , four afghan candidates have been assassinated , while islamic militants , mostly ousted taliban militia , have vowed to disrupt voting .

the german army did not send additional troops , since it already has 2,230 soldiers in afghanistan - twenty soldiers fewer than the maximum number authorized by the german parliament .
most of the german soldiers are stationed in kabul , but a smaller contingent of 450 troops is in the north of afghanistan .

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?

still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?

volkswagen sold 220,774 passenger vehicles in the first half of this year for a 13.6 percent share of the china market , but this is forecast to slip to 10 percent over the next three years .
according to automotive resource asia , volkswagen will cling on to a slight lead in sales volume this year with 360,000 units , followed by gm and hyundai , both with sales of around 300,000 .
gm is then expected to take the top spot with a 10.9 percent share for 2006 .
volkswagen , which 20 years ago ventured into china as the first western auto manufacturer , was rewarded for its vision with years of near monopoly of the government and taxi market .
but now , with scandals and financial troubles at home and bloated management in china , the company is struggling .
volkswagen 's joint ventures in china - shanghai vw and first automotive works vw - recorded an operating loss of 23 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- in the first half of this year compared with a profit of 251 million euros for the same period in 2004 . dw-world.de volkswagen announces job cuts volkswagen has confirmed plans to cut more than 10,000 jobs in germany .
the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers .

britain urged the european union on wednesday to toughen up its fight against terrorism , and reassess its human rights laws that prevent the deportation of suspected terrorists . british home secretary charles clarke urged eu officials on wednesday to reevaluate the balance between human rights and security in the age of global terrorism . it is now necessary " to balance these very important rights for individuals against the collective right for security against those who attack us through terrorist violence , " clarke told members of the european parliament .
" i have concluded that the balance now is not right and that it needs to be closely examined in the heightened threat that we now face .

britain urged the european union on wednesday to toughen up its fight against terrorism , and reassess its human rights laws that prevent the deportation of suspected terrorists . british home secretary charles clarke urged eu officials on wednesday to reevaluate the balance between human rights and security in the age of global terrorism . it is now necessary " to balance these very important rights for individuals against the collective right for security against those who attack us through terrorist violence , " clarke told members of the european parliament .
" i have concluded that the balance now is not right and that it needs to be closely examined in the heightened threat that we now face . " the appeal by the eu 's current british presidency came ahead of a two-day meeting of eu justice and interior ministers which starts thursday in newcastle-upon-tyne , northern england . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clarke -lrb- right -rrb- says tougher measures critical " it is our duty to promote the view that democracy and not violence is the means of making change , " he said .
" we have to defend our values of respect , tolerance , freedom and democracy against any who wish to destroy or replace them with some other doctrine , particularly if they seek to use violence to promote their ambition . " human rights lobby concerned prime minister tony blair 's government launched a crackdown on islamic fundamentalism in the wake of the july 7 attacks on london transportation system that left 56 people dead , including four apparent suicide bombers . but some of the proposed measures , such as deporting so-called preachers of hate - even to countries with a reputation for torture - have raised serious concerns from the human rights lobby and civil liberties campaigners . in addition , clarke encouraged eu nations to share intelligence on terrorism and organized crime , noting that countries should agree common standards on using technology such as biometric data . clarke 's comments will fuel a debate on the content of the european convention of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , which prevents the deportation of a foreign terrorist suspect if the person could be put at risk of torture . a decisive battle eu justice commissioner franco frattini also underlined the need to give no quarter to terrorists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be balanced with security concerns , frattini says " failure to meet the challenges facing us is simply unthinkable , " he said .
" after ny , after madrid , after london we must respond to expectations that the -lrb- eu -rrb- act with authority and determination on the world stage .
we are engaged in a battle which will be long and decisive . " he cautioned , nonetheless , that a balance needs to be reached . " we should never be tired to repeat that when working on security we have to keep a balance between law enforcement activities and the protection of other fundamental rights , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the next targets ?

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2005 rebuilding a devastated city großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says after the onslaught by hurricane katrina , the city of new orleans practically ceased to exist .
prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?
as a conference on sustainable development begins in berlin , director of the un environment program klaus töpfer says katrina taught the world that it 's time for a new global energy policy .

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .

18 , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his government 's record and sharply criticized his challenger , angela merkel . in what appeared to many observers as a rehash of sunday 's televised debate , gerhard schröder and angela merkel used the last parliamentary session before the election to engage in another verbal showdown . schröder 's 40-minute speech was at times emotional and humorous .
the incumbent defended his government 's record over the past seven years , and called on voters to grant him a third term . merkel also made a self-confident appearance , but as in sunday 's debate , was deemed to have come across less convincingly than her media-savvy opponent . energy an issue schröder used the current turmoil over oil prices in the wake of hurricane katrina to praise his government ’ s " shrewd " energy policy , which promotes a phase-out of nuclear power and a greater reliance on renewable energy sources . “ it ’ s absolutely vital that we pursue an energy policy which leads us away from too much dependence on oil , " schröder said .
" i remember vividly how the opposition conservatives criticized our strategy on investing in renewable energies .
but now even they have had to realize that there ’ s no reasonable alternative to our course . ” schröder hit out at the opposition 's plans to give fresh impetus to nuclear energy as " completely the wrong path to take . " he also lambasted the christian democrats ' tax proposals , including a two-percentage-point rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which he said was " nonsensical . " on his own record on the highly sensitive issue of unemployment , schröder told parliament that his reforms " were starting to work , " and accused merkel of painting a negative picture of the situation . " you 're finished " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel during the parliamentary session on sept.7 , 2005 .
in reply , merkel , accused the chancellor of failing to see the realities . “ after seven years of a red-green coalition government , we have more jobless people and less economic growth than back in 1998 , " merkel said . addressing schröder , she accused him of giving germany " seven years of empty promises , of following the wrong policies , or of not seeing things through . " " that 's why you 're finished , " she said . merkel 's lead shrinking following sunday 's debate , though , merkel 's once substantial lead over schröder has shrunk , according to a poll by the forsa research institute .
on wednesday , surveys showed she may not achieve her goal of a center-right coalition . the forsa poll carried out immediately after sunday 's debate showed a coalition of merkel 's cdu and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- winning a combined 48 percent of the vote , one point less than the total of all other parties . a separate survey by pollsters emnid gave merkel 's coalition a one-point lead . " if this development stabilizes , it will be tight for cdu / csu and fdp , " forsa chief manfred göllner told german broadcaster rtl . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel better than expected in debate the polls are showing that chancellor schröder won the tv debate against his challenger , but angela merkel exceeded expectations and won the arguably most important segment of the debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2005 helping scientists juggle kids and career großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist nüsslein-volhard : " a good researcher can not be replaced " women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .
a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .
political issues indeed , politicians have spent the past few years grappling with issues such as all-day schools and expanded daycare for small children .
compared with most other european countries , germany is considered unfriendly toward working mothers on these topics .
over the past decade , the scientific community has worked hard to address the imbalances . mentoring programs have mushroomed , while federal and local monies have been directed into programs aimed at helping women in the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german science ca n't afford losing talented women these measures have met with some success .
the numbers of female science professors have been growing over the last decade , and there are now more women professors than at any time in the country 's history . so far , though , the nüsslein-vollhard foundation has been the first to try to achieve parity by financing household appliances . lost opportunity cews ' lind says it 's important to realize promoting women 's role in science is a question of equal opportunity , but also much more than that .
" there are profound reasons to continue increasing the number of women professors , " lind said .
" on the one hand , greater input from women ... would give a different perspective to science , " she said , noting recent acknowledgement of a longstanding ' male bias ’ in pharmaceutical and medical research .
financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2005 helping scientists juggle kids and career großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist nüsslein-volhard : " a good researcher can not be replaced " women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .
a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "

a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .

the motto of the beethoven festival in 2005 is liberté . the beethoven festival in bonn may have dropped the " international " from its name , but its scope and line-up certainly remain so .
under the patronage of german president horst köhler , the sixty-four events and additional side events will take place from september 8 until october 2 at twenty-five locations in bonn , the city where ludwig van beethoven was born , as well as in the picturesque surrounding regions on the river rhine .

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .
though it is hard to predict the outcome of a hurricane , the armchair quarterbacks are now having a field day as to what went wrong and how it should have been done .
all we can do now is learn and get help to all of our citizens in need as quickly as possible .
and really plan for a future hurricane strike , for it 's just a matter of time before the next one strikes .
the biggest disappointment was our neighbor to the north , canada .
it took them four days to even call our president to offer some help .
if the tables were turned i know we would have been at the border asking what can we do to help .
such is life . - werner , charleston , usa compiled by dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?

i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .

this time , british prime minister tony blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation . " airbus deal announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus will sell 43 planes to india in a deal worth 1.76 billion euros one key business deal has already been inked with india 's purchase of 43 planes from european aircraft maker airbus for 1.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- .
the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes . " we all know that the airbus has been highly successful aircraft around the world , " blair said , adding the purchase was a welcome sign of growing trade relations between the european union and india . germans eye nuclear deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhard another area of trade with india favored by some members of the german government is nuclear technology .
the foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wolfgang schäuble , told the financial times deutschland that he would follow the example of the united states ' government , by allowing german firms to export nuclear reactors and technology to india .
cdu leader and frontrunner for chancellor in germany 's upcoming general election angela merkel has hinted in the past that she would pursue nuclear technology export deals with both india and china , where atomic energy is a booming industry . schäuble 's comments drew criticism from germany 's free-market liberal party , the fdp , as well as environmentalists , who point to the fact that india engaged in controversial weapons testing in 1998 and has never signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . the fdp 's parliamentary leader wolfgang gerhardt warned that supplying india with nuclear technology would only serve to " strengthen the iranians , " at a time when the eu is struggling to convince iran to abandon its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimistic india meets pessimistic germany as german industry begins to wake up to the endless opportunities in the vast expanse of india , indian companies are slowly but surely tapping into germany .

18 .
the nato-lead international forces continue to play a key role ensuring safety and stability . the importance of the afghan parliamentary and regional elections , less than one year after the presidential poll , has not gone unnoticed in the international community .
berlin has donated $ 3 million -lrb- 2.4 million euros -rrb- to the united nations fund to help defray the costs of organizing the vote .
seventy election observers , including six representatives from germany , have already been dispatched to afghanistan .
by election day , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will have 140 observers in place , supported by some 7,000 afghan helpers .
the elections in afghanistan remain , nonetheless , a hazardous matter .
the european union has already declared four of 34 provinces too dangerous to send election monitors .
so far , four afghan candidates have been assassinated , while islamic militants , mostly ousted taliban militia , have vowed to disrupt voting .
isaf playing key role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck -lrb- left -rrb- together with colonel reinhard burz in kunduz last october the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- has stocked up its forces in kabul and other areas in the country by 2,000 , thus increasing the number of troops that will be present before , during and after the election to 11,000 .
the german army did not send additional troops , since it already has 2,230 soldiers in afghanistan - twenty soldiers fewer than the maximum number authorized by the german parliament .
most of the german soldiers are stationed in kabul , but a smaller contingent of 450 troops is in the north of afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police trainer in front of afghan recruits if the german forces should be bumped up to 3,000 in the near future .
german defense minister struck also wants to eliminate the current geographical restrictions on bundeswehr soldiers .
" in concordance with the ongoing role of nato , we should assume complete responsibility in northern afghanistan , including mazar-e sharif , " struck said .
" with parliament 's permission , we would also be allowed to extend our mission to the west of the country , if requested , " he said .
time constraints in germany changes in the german contingent will not occur before elections on sept .
18 .
the un must first approve the continuation of the international community 's role in afghanistan .
this will happen in mid-september , at the earliest .
in addition , the new german parliamentarians may not yet be in berlin before the afghanistan mandate expires on oct .
13 , which means that the outgoing german parliament may have to address this issue even after the german elections .
bildunterschrift : a convoy of german armoured vehicles from isaf defense affairs spokesman christian schmidt of the opposition csu criticized the timetable as " adventurous , " but all other parties agreed that they wanted to wait for the presentation of the un draft mandate before taking up the matter .
there is a consensus among german politicians that the situation in afghanistan is too unstable to have isaf removed in the near future . nina werkhäuser -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every soldier is aware of that risk " after a blast which killed two german soldiers in northern afghanistan last weekend , dw-world spoke with a german military official stationed in kunduz about the duties and dangers of peacekeeping .

this time , british prime minister tony blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation . " airbus deal announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus will sell 43 planes to india in a deal worth 1.76 billion euros one key business deal has already been inked with india 's purchase of 43 planes from european aircraft maker airbus for 1.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- .
the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes . " we all know that the airbus has been highly successful aircraft around the world , " blair said , adding the purchase was a welcome sign of growing trade relations between the european union and india . germans eye nuclear deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhard another area of trade with india favored by some members of the german government is nuclear technology .
the foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wolfgang schäuble , told the financial times deutschland that he would follow the example of the united states ' government , by allowing german firms to export nuclear reactors and technology to india .
cdu leader and frontrunner for chancellor in germany 's upcoming general election angela merkel has hinted in the past that she would pursue nuclear technology export deals with both india and china , where atomic energy is a booming industry . schäuble 's comments drew criticism from germany 's free-market liberal party , the fdp , as well as environmentalists , who point to the fact that india engaged in controversial weapons testing in 1998 and has never signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . the fdp 's parliamentary leader wolfgang gerhardt warned that supplying india with nuclear technology would only serve to " strengthen the iranians , " at a time when the eu is struggling to convince iran to abandon its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimistic india meets pessimistic germany as german industry begins to wake up to the endless opportunities in the vast expanse of india , indian companies are slowly but surely tapping into germany .

the nato-lead international forces continue to play a key role ensuring safety and stability . the importance of the afghan parliamentary and regional elections , less than one year after the presidential poll , has not gone unnoticed in the international community .
berlin has donated $ 3 million -lrb- 2.4 million euros -rrb- to the united nations fund to help defray the costs of organizing the vote .
seventy election observers , including six representatives from germany , have already been dispatched to afghanistan .
by election day , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will have 140 observers in place , supported by some 7,000 afghan helpers .
the elections in afghanistan remain , nonetheless , a hazardous matter .
the european union has already declared four of 34 provinces too dangerous to send election monitors .
so far , four afghan candidates have been assassinated , while islamic militants , mostly ousted taliban militia , have vowed to disrupt voting .

the german army did not send additional troops , since it already has 2,230 soldiers in afghanistan - twenty soldiers fewer than the maximum number authorized by the german parliament .
most of the german soldiers are stationed in kabul , but a smaller contingent of 450 troops is in the north of afghanistan .

" with parliament 's permission , we would also be allowed to extend our mission to the west of the country , if requested , " he said .
time constraints in germany changes in the german contingent will not occur before elections on sept .

this will happen in mid-september , at the earliest .

bildunterschrift : a convoy of german armoured vehicles from isaf defense affairs spokesman christian schmidt of the opposition csu criticized the timetable as " adventurous , " but all other parties agreed that they wanted to wait for the presentation of the un draft mandate before taking up the matter .

sale of the oil , which germany and 26 other countries agreed to free up earlier this week , started in rotterdam wednesday .
germany 's decision to join other international energy agency nations and put emergency reserves on the market was not merely out of solidarity with the devastated us region , chancellor gerhard schröder said .

" we ’ re assuming that this oil will create a sufficient energy supply on the market and also reduce the pressure on oil prices , " schröder told reporters .
questioning the sale but some experts , like bernhard hillibrand from the rwi essen research institute , said releasing oil reserves won ’ t necessarily solve the problem .
" you can release oil supplies for two months , for example .
but what nobody can say for sure is if this will bring down the prices at the same time .
impulse buying might cause them to rise , " he noted .
numerous politicians have accused the oil and gas industries of unscrupulously profiting from pressured oil production due to the ongoing iraq war and now the disasterous hurricane in the united states .
in possible his last state-of-the-nation address ahead of national elections sept .

" it is unsure whether the tie between oil and gas prices is really justified under current conditions , " schröder said during a speech in the bundestag .
consumer affairs minister renate künast did not beat around the bush .
" the coupling of natural gas -lrb- and oil -rrb- prices must finally be abolished , " künast told bild newspaper on wednesday .
" russian gas has nothing to do with arabian oil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast schröder and künast have said they would like the federal cartel office to look into the matter .
in germany , oil and natural gas prices have been linked since the 1960s .
but finance minister hans eichel commented that a decoupling would n't change much , because energy prices have risen in general .
by the end of this year , natural gas prices are expected to have increased by 15 percent since december .
schröder 's social democratic colleague and party head franz müntefering said he doubted such a decoupling would be effective and noted that price linking was connected to international agreements that have been around for decades . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un calls for reduced oil dependency as a conference on sustainable development begins in berlin , director of the un environment program klaus töpfer says katrina taught the world that it 's time for a new global energy policy .

18 , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his government 's record and sharply criticized his challenger , angela merkel . in what appeared to many observers as a rehash of sunday 's televised debate , gerhard schröder and angela merkel used the last parliamentary session before the election to engage in another verbal showdown . schröder 's 40-minute speech was at times emotional and humorous .
the incumbent defended his government 's record over the past seven years , and called on voters to grant him a third term . merkel also made a self-confident appearance , but as in sunday 's debate , was deemed to have come across less convincingly than her media-savvy opponent . energy an issue schröder used the current turmoil over oil prices in the wake of hurricane katrina to praise his government ’ s " shrewd " energy policy , which promotes a phase-out of nuclear power and a greater reliance on renewable energy sources . “ it ’ s absolutely vital that we pursue an energy policy which leads us away from too much dependence on oil , " schröder said .
" i remember vividly how the opposition conservatives criticized our strategy on investing in renewable energies .
but now even they have had to realize that there ’ s no reasonable alternative to our course . ” schröder hit out at the opposition 's plans to give fresh impetus to nuclear energy as " completely the wrong path to take . " he also lambasted the christian democrats ' tax proposals , including a two-percentage-point rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which he said was " nonsensical . " on his own record on the highly sensitive issue of unemployment , schröder told parliament that his reforms " were starting to work , " and accused merkel of painting a negative picture of the situation . " you 're finished " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel during the parliamentary session on sept.7 , 2005 .
in reply , merkel , accused the chancellor of failing to see the realities . “ after seven years of a red-green coalition government , we have more jobless people and less economic growth than back in 1998 , " merkel said . addressing schröder , she accused him of giving germany " seven years of empty promises , of following the wrong policies , or of not seeing things through . " " that 's why you 're finished , " she said . merkel 's lead shrinking following sunday 's debate , though , merkel 's once substantial lead over schröder has shrunk , according to a poll by the forsa research institute .
on wednesday , surveys showed she may not achieve her goal of a center-right coalition . the forsa poll carried out immediately after sunday 's debate showed a coalition of merkel 's cdu and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- winning a combined 48 percent of the vote , one point less than the total of all other parties . a separate survey by pollsters emnid gave merkel 's coalition a one-point lead .

by offering something for everyone , organizers hope the event can keep its reputation as the " mother of all literary festivals . " germany is not lacking in literary festivals .
leipzig reads , litcologne , and the aachen storytelling festival are three of the bigger ones . but the jewel in the crown of the german literary season is the international literature festival berlin , or ilb . as festivals go , the ilb certainly does n't lack for ambition . more than 100 authors will take part in 300 separate events over the course of 12 days .
these include book and poetry readings , author appearances and political discussions , in dozens of sites throughout the city . in 2004 , organizers said that they hosted 35,500 visitors ; they are expecting a similar number this year .
that may be smaller than the international book festival in edinburgh , which had had 220,000 visitors , 500 authors and 650 events over two weeks this year .
but it is still a huge undertaking , with a large turnout . international , political the festival has two main sections , literatures of the world and kaleidescope .
the literatures of the world invitees were nominated by a jury of well known authors .

britain urged the european union on wednesday to toughen up its fight against terrorism , and reassess its human rights laws that prevent the deportation of suspected terrorists . british home secretary charles clarke urged eu officials on wednesday to reevaluate the balance between human rights and security in the age of global terrorism . it is now necessary " to balance these very important rights for individuals against the collective right for security against those who attack us through terrorist violence , " clarke told members of the european parliament .
" i have concluded that the balance now is not right and that it needs to be closely examined in the heightened threat that we now face . " the appeal by the eu 's current british presidency came ahead of a two-day meeting of eu justice and interior ministers which starts thursday in newcastle-upon-tyne , northern england . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clarke -lrb- right -rrb- says tougher measures critical " it is our duty to promote the view that democracy and not violence is the means of making change , " he said .
" we have to defend our values of respect , tolerance , freedom and democracy against any who wish to destroy or replace them with some other doctrine , particularly if they seek to use violence to promote their ambition . " human rights lobby concerned prime minister tony blair 's government launched a crackdown on islamic fundamentalism in the wake of the july 7 attacks on london transportation system that left 56 people dead , including four apparent suicide bombers . but some of the proposed measures , such as deporting so-called preachers of hate - even to countries with a reputation for torture - have raised serious concerns from the human rights lobby and civil liberties campaigners . in addition , clarke encouraged eu nations to share intelligence on terrorism and organized crime , noting that countries should agree common standards on using technology such as biometric data . clarke 's comments will fuel a debate on the content of the european convention of human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , which prevents the deportation of a foreign terrorist suspect if the person could be put at risk of torture . a decisive battle eu justice commissioner franco frattini also underlined the need to give no quarter to terrorists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights need to be balanced with security concerns , frattini says " failure to meet the challenges facing us is simply unthinkable , " he said .

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .

18 , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his government 's record and sharply criticized his challenger , angela merkel . in what appeared to many observers as a rehash of sunday 's televised debate , gerhard schröder and angela merkel used the last parliamentary session before the election to engage in another verbal showdown . schröder 's 40-minute speech was at times emotional and humorous .
the incumbent defended his government 's record over the past seven years , and called on voters to grant him a third term . merkel also made a self-confident appearance , but as in sunday 's debate , was deemed to have come across less convincingly than her media-savvy opponent . energy an issue schröder used the current turmoil over oil prices in the wake of hurricane katrina to praise his government ’ s " shrewd " energy policy , which promotes a phase-out of nuclear power and a greater reliance on renewable energy sources . “ it ’ s absolutely vital that we pursue an energy policy which leads us away from too much dependence on oil , " schröder said .
" i remember vividly how the opposition conservatives criticized our strategy on investing in renewable energies .
but now even they have had to realize that there ’ s no reasonable alternative to our course . ” schröder hit out at the opposition 's plans to give fresh impetus to nuclear energy as " completely the wrong path to take . " he also lambasted the christian democrats ' tax proposals , including a two-percentage-point rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which he said was " nonsensical . " on his own record on the highly sensitive issue of unemployment , schröder told parliament that his reforms " were starting to work , " and accused merkel of painting a negative picture of the situation . " you 're finished " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel during the parliamentary session on sept.7 , 2005 .
in reply , merkel , accused the chancellor of failing to see the realities . “ after seven years of a red-green coalition government , we have more jobless people and less economic growth than back in 1998 , " merkel said . addressing schröder , she accused him of giving germany " seven years of empty promises , of following the wrong policies , or of not seeing things through . " " that 's why you 're finished , " she said . merkel 's lead shrinking following sunday 's debate , though , merkel 's once substantial lead over schröder has shrunk , according to a poll by the forsa research institute .
on wednesday , surveys showed she may not achieve her goal of a center-right coalition . the forsa poll carried out immediately after sunday 's debate showed a coalition of merkel 's cdu and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- winning a combined 48 percent of the vote , one point less than the total of all other parties . a separate survey by pollsters emnid gave merkel 's coalition a one-point lead . " if this development stabilizes , it will be tight for cdu / csu and fdp , " forsa chief manfred göllner told german broadcaster rtl . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel better than expected in debate the polls are showing that chancellor schröder won the tv debate against his challenger , but angela merkel exceeded expectations and won the arguably most important segment of the debate .

5 , 2005 -rrb- german press says schröder won newspaper editors were almost unanimous that chancellor schröder won sunday 's long-awaited debate against challenger angela merkel .
yet most were disappointed by the attention to detail or simply the lack of new data .

this time , british prime minister tony blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .

the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes . " we all know that the airbus has been highly successful aircraft around the world , " blair said , adding the purchase was a welcome sign of growing trade relations between the european union and india . germans eye nuclear deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhard another area of trade with india favored by some members of the german government is nuclear technology .

cdu leader and frontrunner for chancellor in germany 's upcoming general election angela merkel has hinted in the past that she would pursue nuclear technology export deals with both india and china , where atomic energy is a booming industry . schäuble 's comments drew criticism from germany 's free-market liberal party , the fdp , as well as environmentalists , who point to the fact that india engaged in controversial weapons testing in 1998 and has never signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . the fdp 's parliamentary leader wolfgang gerhardt warned that supplying india with nuclear technology would only serve to " strengthen the iranians , " at a time when the eu is struggling to convince iran to abandon its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimistic india meets pessimistic germany as german industry begins to wake up to the endless opportunities in the vast expanse of india , indian companies are slowly but surely tapping into germany .

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .
though it is hard to predict the outcome of a hurricane , the armchair quarterbacks are now having a field day as to what went wrong and how it should have been done .
all we can do now is learn and get help to all of our citizens in need as quickly as possible .
and really plan for a future hurricane strike , for it 's just a matter of time before the next one strikes .
the biggest disappointment was our neighbor to the north , canada .
it took them four days to even call our president to offer some help .
if the tables were turned i know we would have been at the border asking what can we do to help .
such is life . - werner , charleston , usa compiled by dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .
though it is hard to predict the outcome of a hurricane , the armchair quarterbacks are now having a field day as to what went wrong and how it should have been done .
all we can do now is learn and get help to all of our citizens in need as quickly as possible .
and really plan for a future hurricane strike , for it 's just a matter of time before the next one strikes .
the biggest disappointment was our neighbor to the north , canada .
it took them four days to even call our president to offer some help .
if the tables were turned i know we would have been at the border asking what can we do to help .
such is life . - werner , charleston , usa compiled by dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?
hurricane katrina has devastated large parts of new orleans and the adjacent gulf coast region .
dw-world readers comment on the disaster .
-lrb- sept .
2 , 2005 -rrb- germany prepared to help the us while us emergency teams are working around the clock in the mostly submerged city of new orleans , the german government , although highly critical of us environmental policies , is offering its help .
-lrb- sept .
1 , 2005 -rrb- aid pouring into us from abroad aid from around the world is streaming to the united states in the wake of hurricane katrina .
george w. bush has had his hands full in managing the clean-up but has also taken time to thank those who have helped .

the motto of the beethoven festival in 2005 is liberté . the beethoven festival in bonn may have dropped the " international " from its name , but its scope and line-up certainly remain so .
under the patronage of german president horst köhler , the sixty-four events and additional side events will take place from september 8 until october 2 at twenty-five locations in bonn , the city where ludwig van beethoven was born , as well as in the picturesque surrounding regions on the river rhine .
with the motto bohemia , last year ’ s festival looked towards the east .
in 2005 the motto is liberté , turning the focus to the west , or to be more precise , to france and its rich cultural heritage .
festival director ilona schmiel on the motto : " liberté is a key word of the french revolution .
there are many historical connections , including the two hundredth anniversary of friedrich schiller ’ s death in 1805 as well as the first performance of " fidelio " .
we will embark on a voyage through time to encounter the revolutionary ideas and music that had a great effect on beethoven , and we will present it to all visitors in a grand context .
one highlight is certainly the orchestre national de france with kurt masur and an all-french program .
we also have jean-yves thibaudet , lise de la salle , helène grimaud and of course the new york philharmonic with lorin maazel , but also a grand master of the calibre of alfred brendel . "
tradition and modernism ludwig van beethoven lived during the age of enlightenment .
this was a time of revolutionary ideas and social upheaval .
it was also the era when the first orchestras and music societies for middle-class citizens were founded .
but the beethoven festival is not primarily a museum of music history , as this year 's line-up includes eight newly commissioned works .
of course , much beethoven will be heard as well , including several cycles .
his thirty-two piano sonatas will be played by garrick ohlsson , andreas staier , louis lortie and bernd glemser .
in two recitals , the beaux arts trio will perform beethoven 's complete piano trios .
the programme also includes all of beethoven 's late string quartets .
on that subject : building on last year 's experience of the " long night of the pianos , " this time a " long night of the string quartets " will be a big attraction .
and on september the 25th , two hundred years to the day after the premiere of " fidelio " .
beethoven 's only opera will be staged at the bonn opera house in a new production by director günter krämer .
fostering young talent ! the orchestral campus , a collaboration with deutsche welle as media and co-partner of the beethoven festival , enters its fifth year in 2005 .
after ukraine , turkey , georgia and china in past seasons , this time the invitation went to an outstanding youth orchestra from poland .

the motto of the beethoven festival in 2005 is liberté . the beethoven festival in bonn may have dropped the " international " from its name , but its scope and line-up certainly remain so .
under the patronage of german president horst köhler , the sixty-four events and additional side events will take place from september 8 until october 2 at twenty-five locations in bonn , the city where ludwig van beethoven was born , as well as in the picturesque surrounding regions on the river rhine .
with the motto bohemia , last year ’ s festival looked towards the east .
in 2005 the motto is liberté , turning the focus to the west , or to be more precise , to france and its rich cultural heritage .
festival director ilona schmiel on the motto : " liberté is a key word of the french revolution .
there are many historical connections , including the two hundredth anniversary of friedrich schiller ’ s death in 1805 as well as the first performance of " fidelio " .
we will embark on a voyage through time to encounter the revolutionary ideas and music that had a great effect on beethoven , and we will present it to all visitors in a grand context .
one highlight is certainly the orchestre national de france with kurt masur and an all-french program .
we also have jean-yves thibaudet , lise de la salle , helène grimaud and of course the new york philharmonic with lorin maazel , but also a grand master of the calibre of alfred brendel . "
tradition and modernism ludwig van beethoven lived during the age of enlightenment .
this was a time of revolutionary ideas and social upheaval .
it was also the era when the first orchestras and music societies for middle-class citizens were founded .
but the beethoven festival is not primarily a museum of music history , as this year 's line-up includes eight newly commissioned works .
of course , much beethoven will be heard as well , including several cycles .
his thirty-two piano sonatas will be played by garrick ohlsson , andreas staier , louis lortie and bernd glemser .
in two recitals , the beaux arts trio will perform beethoven 's complete piano trios .
the programme also includes all of beethoven 's late string quartets .
on that subject : building on last year 's experience of the " long night of the pianos , " this time a " long night of the string quartets " will be a big attraction .
and on september the 25th , two hundred years to the day after the premiere of " fidelio " .
beethoven 's only opera will be staged at the bonn opera house in a new production by director günter krämer .
fostering young talent ! the orchestral campus , a collaboration with deutsche welle as media and co-partner of the beethoven festival , enters its fifth year in 2005 .
after ukraine , turkey , georgia and china in past seasons , this time the invitation went to an outstanding youth orchestra from poland .
coinciding with the current german-polish year 2005-2006 , the orchestra of the krakow music academy will be coming to bonn .
one of the highlights of this programme will be the world première of a work by the young polish composer agata zubel .
arts.21 will be presenting her in a portrait , just as we introduced the winners of the deutsche welle composition prize of the last two years who came from china and georgia .

a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .

what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .

compared with most other european countries , germany is considered unfriendly toward working mothers on these topics .

financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .

a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .

the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .

by offering something for everyone , organizers hope the event can keep its reputation as the " mother of all literary festivals . " germany is not lacking in literary festivals .
leipzig reads , litcologne , and the aachen storytelling festival are three of the bigger ones . but the jewel in the crown of the german literary season is the international literature festival berlin , or ilb . as festivals go , the ilb certainly does n't lack for ambition . more than 100 authors will take part in 300 separate events over the course of 12 days .
these include book and poetry readings , author appearances and political discussions , in dozens of sites throughout the city . in 2004 , organizers said that they hosted 35,500 visitors ; they are expecting a similar number this year .
that may be smaller than the international book festival in edinburgh , which had had 220,000 visitors , 500 authors and 650 events over two weeks this year .
but it is still a huge undertaking , with a large turnout . international , political the festival has two main sections , literatures of the world and kaleidescope .
the literatures of the world invitees were nominated by a jury of well known authors .
with writers coming from every continent , this section fo the festival seems likely to live up to its name .
kaleidescope authors were invited expressly by the festival organizers , and the focus is on literature that deals with current cultural and political developments.their appearances are supported by an international network of sponsors and friends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drowning in literature while some people say reading is a dying art , the ilb apparently sees things differently . the international children ’ s and youth literature program has diverse readings and exhibitions for kids , while the scritture giovani project encourages young european authors . for 2005 , scritture giovani - a cooperation between several large european literary festivals - has asked five young authors from different countries to write a short story on the theme of “ elsewhere . ”
these will be presented at various literature festivals , and later published in a single , five-language volume . spotlight on california every year , the festival highlights a geographic region .
this time , california is in the spotlight . moving away from the clichés of hippies , hollywood and schwarzenegger , the show wants to offer a overview of the literary life of the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california expert kevin starr " if america did n't have california , the psyche of the nation would be different , " said kevin starr , a historian who has written about the state and is known as california 's " living archives . " an important force in american creativity would be lost , then . " another guest of the festival is steve wasserman , former features editor of the los angeles times , a well-known intellectual and pulizer prize juror .
he complained before the festival that too few us newspapers publish book reviews or news about literature . " it is one of the big scandals of american journalism … we are failing our readers , " he said .
the festival runs until sept .

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .

i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .
though it is hard to predict the outcome of a hurricane , the armchair quarterbacks are now having a field day as to what went wrong and how it should have been done .
all we can do now is learn and get help to all of our citizens in need as quickly as possible .
and really plan for a future hurricane strike , for it 's just a matter of time before the next one strikes .
the biggest disappointment was our neighbor to the north , canada .
it took them four days to even call our president to offer some help .
if the tables were turned i know we would have been at the border asking what can we do to help .
such is life . - werner , charleston , usa compiled by dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?
hurricane katrina has devastated large parts of new orleans and the adjacent gulf coast region .
dw-world readers comment on the disaster .
-lrb- sept .
2 , 2005 -rrb- germany prepared to help the us while us emergency teams are working around the clock in the mostly submerged city of new orleans , the german government , although highly critical of us environmental policies , is offering its help .
-lrb- sept .
1 , 2005 -rrb- aid pouring into us from abroad aid from around the world is streaming to the united states in the wake of hurricane katrina .
george w. bush has had his hands full in managing the clean-up but has also taken time to thank those who have helped .
-lrb- sept .
6 , 2005 -rrb- feedback have an opinion on the cause of katrina and foreign aid ?

this time , british prime minister tony blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .

18 , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his government 's record and sharply criticized his challenger , angela merkel . in what appeared to many observers as a rehash of sunday 's televised debate , gerhard schröder and angela merkel used the last parliamentary session before the election to engage in another verbal showdown . schröder 's 40-minute speech was at times emotional and humorous .
the incumbent defended his government 's record over the past seven years , and called on voters to grant him a third term . merkel also made a self-confident appearance , but as in sunday 's debate , was deemed to have come across less convincingly than her media-savvy opponent . energy an issue schröder used the current turmoil over oil prices in the wake of hurricane katrina to praise his government ’ s " shrewd " energy policy , which promotes a phase-out of nuclear power and a greater reliance on renewable energy sources . “ it ’ s absolutely vital that we pursue an energy policy which leads us away from too much dependence on oil , " schröder said .
" i remember vividly how the opposition conservatives criticized our strategy on investing in renewable energies .
but now even they have had to realize that there ’ s no reasonable alternative to our course . ” schröder hit out at the opposition 's plans to give fresh impetus to nuclear energy as " completely the wrong path to take . " he also lambasted the christian democrats ' tax proposals , including a two-percentage-point rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which he said was " nonsensical .

" you 're finished " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel during the parliamentary session on sept.7 , 2005 .
in reply , merkel , accused the chancellor of failing to see the realities . “ after seven years of a red-green coalition government , we have more jobless people and less economic growth than back in 1998 , " merkel said . addressing schröder , she accused him of giving germany " seven years of empty promises , of following the wrong policies , or of not seeing things through . " " that 's why you 're finished , " she said . merkel 's lead shrinking following sunday 's debate , though , merkel 's once substantial lead over schröder has shrunk , according to a poll by the forsa research institute .
on wednesday , surveys showed she may not achieve her goal of a center-right coalition . the forsa poll carried out immediately after sunday 's debate showed a coalition of merkel 's cdu and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- winning a combined 48 percent of the vote , one point less than the total of all other parties . a separate survey by pollsters emnid gave merkel 's coalition a one-point lead .

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?

is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?

18 , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his government 's record and sharply criticized his challenger , angela merkel . in what appeared to many observers as a rehash of sunday 's televised debate , gerhard schröder and angela merkel used the last parliamentary session before the election to engage in another verbal showdown . schröder 's 40-minute speech was at times emotional and humorous .
the incumbent defended his government 's record over the past seven years , and called on voters to grant him a third term . merkel also made a self-confident appearance , but as in sunday 's debate , was deemed to have come across less convincingly than her media-savvy opponent . energy an issue schröder used the current turmoil over oil prices in the wake of hurricane katrina to praise his government ’ s " shrewd " energy policy , which promotes a phase-out of nuclear power and a greater reliance on renewable energy sources . “ it ’ s absolutely vital that we pursue an energy policy which leads us away from too much dependence on oil , " schröder said .
" i remember vividly how the opposition conservatives criticized our strategy on investing in renewable energies .
but now even they have had to realize that there ’ s no reasonable alternative to our course . ” schröder hit out at the opposition 's plans to give fresh impetus to nuclear energy as " completely the wrong path to take . " he also lambasted the christian democrats ' tax proposals , including a two-percentage-point rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which he said was " nonsensical .

" you 're finished " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel during the parliamentary session on sept.7 , 2005 .
in reply , merkel , accused the chancellor of failing to see the realities . “ after seven years of a red-green coalition government , we have more jobless people and less economic growth than back in 1998 , " merkel said . addressing schröder , she accused him of giving germany " seven years of empty promises , of following the wrong policies , or of not seeing things through . " " that 's why you 're finished , " she said . merkel 's lead shrinking following sunday 's debate , though , merkel 's once substantial lead over schröder has shrunk , according to a poll by the forsa research institute .
on wednesday , surveys showed she may not achieve her goal of a center-right coalition . the forsa poll carried out immediately after sunday 's debate showed a coalition of merkel 's cdu and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- winning a combined 48 percent of the vote , one point less than the total of all other parties . a separate survey by pollsters emnid gave merkel 's coalition a one-point lead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2005 helping scientists juggle kids and career großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist nüsslein-volhard : " a good researcher can not be replaced " women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .
a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .
political issues indeed , politicians have spent the past few years grappling with issues such as all-day schools and expanded daycare for small children .
compared with most other european countries , germany is considered unfriendly toward working mothers on these topics .
over the past decade , the scientific community has worked hard to address the imbalances . mentoring programs have mushroomed , while federal and local monies have been directed into programs aimed at helping women in the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german science ca n't afford losing talented women these measures have met with some success .
the numbers of female science professors have been growing over the last decade , and there are now more women professors than at any time in the country 's history . so far , though , the nüsslein-vollhard foundation has been the first to try to achieve parity by financing household appliances . lost opportunity cews ' lind says it 's important to realize promoting women 's role in science is a question of equal opportunity , but also much more than that .
" there are profound reasons to continue increasing the number of women professors , " lind said .
" on the one hand , greater input from women ... would give a different perspective to science , " she said , noting recent acknowledgement of a longstanding ' male bias ’ in pharmaceutical and medical research .
financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .
for germany , " the loss of highly qualified scientists leads to a shrinking pool of human resources that german science can ’ t afford in the long run .
not if it wants to stay internationally competitive .

" from the point of view of a common european policy towards russia , it is unfortunate that one of the eu member states , an important country , germany , should make its own policy decisions , going over the heads of poland and the eu , " kwasniewski said on radio zet , a polish radio station .
" this russian-german project tends away from the concept of a common european policy , " he added .
berlin and moscow are expected to sign an agreement on the pipeline on thursday when russian president vladimir putin visits germany .

18 , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his government 's record and sharply criticized his challenger , angela merkel . in what appeared to many observers as a rehash of sunday 's televised debate , gerhard schröder and angela merkel used the last parliamentary session before the election to engage in another verbal showdown . schröder 's 40-minute speech was at times emotional and humorous .
the incumbent defended his government 's record over the past seven years , and called on voters to grant him a third term . merkel also made a self-confident appearance , but as in sunday 's debate , was deemed to have come across less convincingly than her media-savvy opponent . energy an issue schröder used the current turmoil over oil prices in the wake of hurricane katrina to praise his government ’ s " shrewd " energy policy , which promotes a phase-out of nuclear power and a greater reliance on renewable energy sources . “ it ’ s absolutely vital that we pursue an energy policy which leads us away from too much dependence on oil , " schröder said .
" i remember vividly how the opposition conservatives criticized our strategy on investing in renewable energies .
but now even they have had to realize that there ’ s no reasonable alternative to our course . ” schröder hit out at the opposition 's plans to give fresh impetus to nuclear energy as " completely the wrong path to take . " he also lambasted the christian democrats ' tax proposals , including a two-percentage-point rise in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which he said was " nonsensical . " on his own record on the highly sensitive issue of unemployment , schröder told parliament that his reforms " were starting to work , " and accused merkel of painting a negative picture of the situation . " you 're finished " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel during the parliamentary session on sept.7 , 2005 .
in reply , merkel , accused the chancellor of failing to see the realities . “ after seven years of a red-green coalition government , we have more jobless people and less economic growth than back in 1998 , " merkel said . addressing schröder , she accused him of giving germany " seven years of empty promises , of following the wrong policies , or of not seeing things through . " " that 's why you 're finished , " she said . merkel 's lead shrinking following sunday 's debate , though , merkel 's once substantial lead over schröder has shrunk , according to a poll by the forsa research institute .
on wednesday , surveys showed she may not achieve her goal of a center-right coalition . the forsa poll carried out immediately after sunday 's debate showed a coalition of merkel 's cdu and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- winning a combined 48 percent of the vote , one point less than the total of all other parties . a separate survey by pollsters emnid gave merkel 's coalition a one-point lead . " if this development stabilizes , it will be tight for cdu / csu and fdp , " forsa chief manfred göllner told german broadcaster rtl . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel better than expected in debate the polls are showing that chancellor schröder won the tv debate against his challenger , but angela merkel exceeded expectations and won the arguably most important segment of the debate .

a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .
though it is hard to predict the outcome of a hurricane , the armchair quarterbacks are now having a field day as to what went wrong and how it should have been done .
all we can do now is learn and get help to all of our citizens in need as quickly as possible .
and really plan for a future hurricane strike , for it 's just a matter of time before the next one strikes .
the biggest disappointment was our neighbor to the north , canada .
it took them four days to even call our president to offer some help .

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .
though it is hard to predict the outcome of a hurricane , the armchair quarterbacks are now having a field day as to what went wrong and how it should have been done .
all we can do now is learn and get help to all of our citizens in need as quickly as possible .
and really plan for a future hurricane strike , for it 's just a matter of time before the next one strikes .
the biggest disappointment was our neighbor to the north , canada .
it took them four days to even call our president to offer some help .
if the tables were turned i know we would have been at the border asking what can we do to help .
such is life . - werner , charleston , usa compiled by dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?

the motto of the beethoven festival in 2005 is liberté . the beethoven festival in bonn may have dropped the " international " from its name , but its scope and line-up certainly remain so .
under the patronage of german president horst köhler , the sixty-four events and additional side events will take place from september 8 until october 2 at twenty-five locations in bonn , the city where ludwig van beethoven was born , as well as in the picturesque surrounding regions on the river rhine .
with the motto bohemia , last year ’ s festival looked towards the east .
in 2005 the motto is liberté , turning the focus to the west , or to be more precise , to france and its rich cultural heritage .
festival director ilona schmiel on the motto : " liberté is a key word of the french revolution .
there are many historical connections , including the two hundredth anniversary of friedrich schiller ’ s death in 1805 as well as the first performance of " fidelio " .
we will embark on a voyage through time to encounter the revolutionary ideas and music that had a great effect on beethoven , and we will present it to all visitors in a grand context .
one highlight is certainly the orchestre national de france with kurt masur and an all-french program .
we also have jean-yves thibaudet , lise de la salle , helène grimaud and of course the new york philharmonic with lorin maazel , but also a grand master of the calibre of alfred brendel . "
tradition and modernism ludwig van beethoven lived during the age of enlightenment .
this was a time of revolutionary ideas and social upheaval .
it was also the era when the first orchestras and music societies for middle-class citizens were founded .
but the beethoven festival is not primarily a museum of music history , as this year 's line-up includes eight newly commissioned works .
of course , much beethoven will be heard as well , including several cycles .
his thirty-two piano sonatas will be played by garrick ohlsson , andreas staier , louis lortie and bernd glemser .
in two recitals , the beaux arts trio will perform beethoven 's complete piano trios .
the programme also includes all of beethoven 's late string quartets .
on that subject : building on last year 's experience of the " long night of the pianos , " this time a " long night of the string quartets " will be a big attraction .
and on september the 25th , two hundred years to the day after the premiere of " fidelio " .
beethoven 's only opera will be staged at the bonn opera house in a new production by director günter krämer .
fostering young talent ! the orchestral campus , a collaboration with deutsche welle as media and co-partner of the beethoven festival , enters its fifth year in 2005 .
after ukraine , turkey , georgia and china in past seasons , this time the invitation went to an outstanding youth orchestra from poland .
coinciding with the current german-polish year 2005-2006 , the orchestra of the krakow music academy will be coming to bonn .

the motto of the beethoven festival in 2005 is liberté . the beethoven festival in bonn may have dropped the " international " from its name , but its scope and line-up certainly remain so .
under the patronage of german president horst köhler , the sixty-four events and additional side events will take place from september 8 until october 2 at twenty-five locations in bonn , the city where ludwig van beethoven was born , as well as in the picturesque surrounding regions on the river rhine .
with the motto bohemia , last year ’ s festival looked towards the east .
in 2005 the motto is liberté , turning the focus to the west , or to be more precise , to france and its rich cultural heritage .
festival director ilona schmiel on the motto : " liberté is a key word of the french revolution .
there are many historical connections , including the two hundredth anniversary of friedrich schiller ’ s death in 1805 as well as the first performance of " fidelio " .
we will embark on a voyage through time to encounter the revolutionary ideas and music that had a great effect on beethoven , and we will present it to all visitors in a grand context .
one highlight is certainly the orchestre national de france with kurt masur and an all-french program .

of course , much beethoven will be heard as well , including several cycles .
his thirty-two piano sonatas will be played by garrick ohlsson , andreas staier , louis lortie and bernd glemser .
in two recitals , the beaux arts trio will perform beethoven 's complete piano trios .
the programme also includes all of beethoven 's late string quartets .
on that subject : building on last year 's experience of the " long night of the pianos , " this time a " long night of the string quartets " will be a big attraction .
and on september the 25th , two hundred years to the day after the premiere of " fidelio " .
beethoven 's only opera will be staged at the bonn opera house in a new production by director günter krämer .
fostering young talent ! the orchestral campus , a collaboration with deutsche welle as media and co-partner of the beethoven festival , enters its fifth year in 2005 .

sale of the oil , which germany and 26 other countries agreed to free up earlier this week , started in rotterdam wednesday .
germany 's decision to join other international energy agency nations and put emergency reserves on the market was not merely out of solidarity with the devastated us region , chancellor gerhard schröder said .

" you can release oil supplies for two months , for example .
but what nobody can say for sure is if this will bring down the prices at the same time .
impulse buying might cause them to rise , " he noted .
numerous politicians have accused the oil and gas industries of unscrupulously profiting from pressured oil production due to the ongoing iraq war and now the disasterous hurricane in the united states .

" it is unsure whether the tie between oil and gas prices is really justified under current conditions , " schröder said during a speech in the bundestag .
consumer affairs minister renate künast did not beat around the bush .
" the coupling of natural gas -lrb- and oil -rrb- prices must finally be abolished , " künast told bild newspaper on wednesday .

this time , british prime minister tony blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .
" the most important outcome has been the adoption of a joint action plan … which provides the framework , a road map for identifying pathways for future cooperation . " airbus deal announced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus will sell 43 planes to india in a deal worth 1.76 billion euros one key business deal has already been inked with india 's purchase of 43 planes from european aircraft maker airbus for 1.76 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- .
the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes . " we all know that the airbus has been highly successful aircraft around the world , " blair said , adding the purchase was a welcome sign of growing trade relations between the european union and india . germans eye nuclear deals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhard another area of trade with india favored by some members of the german government is nuclear technology .
the foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , wolfgang schäuble , told the financial times deutschland that he would follow the example of the united states ' government , by allowing german firms to export nuclear reactors and technology to india .
cdu leader and frontrunner for chancellor in germany 's upcoming general election angela merkel has hinted in the past that she would pursue nuclear technology export deals with both india and china , where atomic energy is a booming industry . schäuble 's comments drew criticism from germany 's free-market liberal party , the fdp , as well as environmentalists , who point to the fact that india engaged in controversial weapons testing in 1998 and has never signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . the fdp 's parliamentary leader wolfgang gerhardt warned that supplying india with nuclear technology would only serve to " strengthen the iranians , " at a time when the eu is struggling to convince iran to abandon its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimistic india meets pessimistic germany as german industry begins to wake up to the endless opportunities in the vast expanse of india , indian companies are slowly but surely tapping into germany .

18 .
the nato-lead international forces continue to play a key role ensuring safety and stability . the importance of the afghan parliamentary and regional elections , less than one year after the presidential poll , has not gone unnoticed in the international community .
berlin has donated $ 3 million -lrb- 2.4 million euros -rrb- to the united nations fund to help defray the costs of organizing the vote .
seventy election observers , including six representatives from germany , have already been dispatched to afghanistan .
by election day , the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- will have 140 observers in place , supported by some 7,000 afghan helpers .
the elections in afghanistan remain , nonetheless , a hazardous matter .
the european union has already declared four of 34 provinces too dangerous to send election monitors .
so far , four afghan candidates have been assassinated , while islamic militants , mostly ousted taliban militia , have vowed to disrupt voting .

the german army did not send additional troops , since it already has 2,230 soldiers in afghanistan - twenty soldiers fewer than the maximum number authorized by the german parliament .
most of the german soldiers are stationed in kabul , but a smaller contingent of 450 troops is in the north of afghanistan .

" with parliament 's permission , we would also be allowed to extend our mission to the west of the country , if requested , " he said .
time constraints in germany changes in the german contingent will not occur before elections on sept .

the un must first approve the continuation of the international community 's role in afghanistan .
this will happen in mid-september , at the earliest .
in addition , the new german parliamentarians may not yet be in berlin before the afghanistan mandate expires on oct .
13 , which means that the outgoing german parliament may have to address this issue even after the german elections .
bildunterschrift : a convoy of german armoured vehicles from isaf defense affairs spokesman christian schmidt of the opposition csu criticized the timetable as " adventurous , " but all other parties agreed that they wanted to wait for the presentation of the un draft mandate before taking up the matter .
there is a consensus among german politicians that the situation in afghanistan is too unstable to have isaf removed in the near future . nina werkhäuser -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every soldier is aware of that risk " after a blast which killed two german soldiers in northern afghanistan last weekend , dw-world spoke with a german military official stationed in kunduz about the duties and dangers of peacekeeping .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2005 helping scientists juggle kids and career großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist nüsslein-volhard : " a good researcher can not be replaced " women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .
a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .
political issues indeed , politicians have spent the past few years grappling with issues such as all-day schools and expanded daycare for small children .
compared with most other european countries , germany is considered unfriendly toward working mothers on these topics .
over the past decade , the scientific community has worked hard to address the imbalances . mentoring programs have mushroomed , while federal and local monies have been directed into programs aimed at helping women in the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german science ca n't afford losing talented women these measures have met with some success .
the numbers of female science professors have been growing over the last decade , and there are now more women professors than at any time in the country 's history . so far , though , the nüsslein-vollhard foundation has been the first to try to achieve parity by financing household appliances . lost opportunity cews ' lind says it 's important to realize promoting women 's role in science is a question of equal opportunity , but also much more than that .
" there are profound reasons to continue increasing the number of women professors , " lind said .
" on the one hand , greater input from women ... would give a different perspective to science , " she said , noting recent acknowledgement of a longstanding ' male bias ’ in pharmaceutical and medical research .
financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .
for germany , " the loss of highly qualified scientists leads to a shrinking pool of human resources that german science can ’ t afford in the long run .
not if it wants to stay internationally competitive .

by offering something for everyone , organizers hope the event can keep its reputation as the " mother of all literary festivals . " germany is not lacking in literary festivals .
leipzig reads , litcologne , and the aachen storytelling festival are three of the bigger ones . but the jewel in the crown of the german literary season is the international literature festival berlin , or ilb . as festivals go , the ilb certainly does n't lack for ambition . more than 100 authors will take part in 300 separate events over the course of 12 days .
these include book and poetry readings , author appearances and political discussions , in dozens of sites throughout the city . in 2004 , organizers said that they hosted 35,500 visitors ; they are expecting a similar number this year .
that may be smaller than the international book festival in edinburgh , which had had 220,000 visitors , 500 authors and 650 events over two weeks this year .
but it is still a huge undertaking , with a large turnout . international , political the festival has two main sections , literatures of the world and kaleidescope .
the literatures of the world invitees were nominated by a jury of well known authors .
with writers coming from every continent , this section fo the festival seems likely to live up to its name .
kaleidescope authors were invited expressly by the festival organizers , and the focus is on literature that deals with current cultural and political developments.their appearances are supported by an international network of sponsors and friends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drowning in literature while some people say reading is a dying art , the ilb apparently sees things differently . the international children ’ s and youth literature program has diverse readings and exhibitions for kids , while the scritture giovani project encourages young european authors . for 2005 , scritture giovani - a cooperation between several large european literary festivals - has asked five young authors from different countries to write a short story on the theme of “ elsewhere . ”
these will be presented at various literature festivals , and later published in a single , five-language volume . spotlight on california every year , the festival highlights a geographic region .
this time , california is in the spotlight . moving away from the clichés of hippies , hollywood and schwarzenegger , the show wants to offer a overview of the literary life of the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california expert kevin starr " if america did n't have california , the psyche of the nation would be different , " said kevin starr , a historian who has written about the state and is known as california 's " living archives . " an important force in american creativity would be lost , then . " another guest of the festival is steve wasserman , former features editor of the los angeles times , a well-known intellectual and pulizer prize juror .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.09.2005 berlin festival tops literary calendar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature taking center stage berlin 's international literature festival kicked off this week .
by offering something for everyone , organizers hope the event can keep its reputation as the " mother of all literary festivals . " germany is not lacking in literary festivals .
leipzig reads , litcologne , and the aachen storytelling festival are three of the bigger ones . but the jewel in the crown of the german literary season is the international literature festival berlin , or ilb . as festivals go , the ilb certainly does n't lack for ambition . more than 100 authors will take part in 300 separate events over the course of 12 days .
these include book and poetry readings , author appearances and political discussions , in dozens of sites throughout the city . in 2004 , organizers said that they hosted 35,500 visitors ; they are expecting a similar number this year .
that may be smaller than the international book festival in edinburgh , which had had 220,000 visitors , 500 authors and 650 events over two weeks this year .
but it is still a huge undertaking , with a large turnout . international , political the festival has two main sections , literatures of the world and kaleidescope .
the literatures of the world invitees were nominated by a jury of well known authors .
with writers coming from every continent , this section fo the festival seems likely to live up to its name .
kaleidescope authors were invited expressly by the festival organizers , and the focus is on literature that deals with current cultural and political developments.their appearances are supported by an international network of sponsors and friends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drowning in literature while some people say reading is a dying art , the ilb apparently sees things differently . the international children ’ s and youth literature program has diverse readings and exhibitions for kids , while the scritture giovani project encourages young european authors . for 2005 , scritture giovani - a cooperation between several large european literary festivals - has asked five young authors from different countries to write a short story on the theme of “ elsewhere . ”
these will be presented at various literature festivals , and later published in a single , five-language volume . spotlight on california every year , the festival highlights a geographic region .
this time , california is in the spotlight . moving away from the clichés of hippies , hollywood and schwarzenegger , the show wants to offer a overview of the literary life of the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california expert kevin starr " if america did n't have california , the psyche of the nation would be different , " said kevin starr , a historian who has written about the state and is known as california 's " living archives . " an important force in american creativity would be lost , then . " another guest of the festival is steve wasserman , former features editor of the los angeles times , a well-known intellectual and pulizer prize juror .
he complained before the festival that too few us newspapers publish book reviews or news about literature . " it is one of the big scandals of american journalism … we are failing our readers , " he said .
the festival runs until sept .

seventy election observers , including six representatives from germany , have already been dispatched to afghanistan .

" this russian-german project tends away from the concept of a common european policy , " he added .

by offering something for everyone , organizers hope the event can keep its reputation as the " mother of all literary festivals . " germany is not lacking in literary festivals .
leipzig reads , litcologne , and the aachen storytelling festival are three of the bigger ones . but the jewel in the crown of the german literary season is the international literature festival berlin , or ilb . as festivals go , the ilb certainly does n't lack for ambition . more than 100 authors will take part in 300 separate events over the course of 12 days .
these include book and poetry readings , author appearances and political discussions , in dozens of sites throughout the city . in 2004 , organizers said that they hosted 35,500 visitors ; they are expecting a similar number this year .
that may be smaller than the international book festival in edinburgh , which had had 220,000 visitors , 500 authors and 650 events over two weeks this year .
but it is still a huge undertaking , with a large turnout . international , political the festival has two main sections , literatures of the world and kaleidescope .
the literatures of the world invitees were nominated by a jury of well known authors .
with writers coming from every continent , this section fo the festival seems likely to live up to its name .
kaleidescope authors were invited expressly by the festival organizers , and the focus is on literature that deals with current cultural and political developments.their appearances are supported by an international network of sponsors and friends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drowning in literature while some people say reading is a dying art , the ilb apparently sees things differently . the international children ’ s and youth literature program has diverse readings and exhibitions for kids , while the scritture giovani project encourages young european authors . for 2005 , scritture giovani - a cooperation between several large european literary festivals - has asked five young authors from different countries to write a short story on the theme of “ elsewhere . ”
these will be presented at various literature festivals , and later published in a single , five-language volume . spotlight on california every year , the festival highlights a geographic region .
this time , california is in the spotlight . moving away from the clichés of hippies , hollywood and schwarzenegger , the show wants to offer a overview of the literary life of the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california expert kevin starr " if america did n't have california , the psyche of the nation would be different , " said kevin starr , a historian who has written about the state and is known as california 's " living archives . " an important force in american creativity would be lost , then . " another guest of the festival is steve wasserman , former features editor of the los angeles times , a well-known intellectual and pulizer prize juror .
he complained before the festival that too few us newspapers publish book reviews or news about literature . " it is one of the big scandals of american journalism … we are failing our readers , " he said .
the festival runs until sept .

it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .

" from the point of view of a common european policy towards russia , it is unfortunate that one of the eu member states , an important country , germany , should make its own policy decisions , going over the heads of poland and the eu , " kwasniewski said on radio zet , a polish radio station .
" this russian-german project tends away from the concept of a common european policy , " he added .
berlin and moscow are expected to sign an agreement on the pipeline on thursday when russian president vladimir putin visits germany .
the idea for a north european gas pipeline originated with gazprom of russia .
the signature concerns about 1,200 kilometers -lrb- 750 miles -rrb- of pipeline under the baltic sea from vyborg in russia to greifswald in germany , as part of a total network which is to extend for 3,000 kilometers .
gazprom will build the pipeline with the german basf company , and expects it to be operational in 2010 .
poland and the baltic states are critical of the pipeline project , saying they fear it could see them cut off from supplies of russian gas . dw-world.de ambitious energy project in the pipeline a joint german and russian project is en-route to build one of the most ambitious pipelines ever .
it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices .

the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- report , conducted at sheffield university and published on the bbc web site , revealed that more than half of britain 's population growth in the 1990s can be attributed to immigration .
between 1991 and 2001 , the numbers of overseas-born people living in britain , excluding northern ireland , increased from 5.75 to 7.53 percent of the overall population .
of the 1.1 million people who moved to britain in the 1990s , 262,276 were born in germany .
it has been suggested , however , that a large portion of the german-born immigrants were children of the british army personnel stationed in germany .
the other three top birthplaces for british immigrants were republic of ireland -lrb- 494,850 -rrb- , india -lrb- 466,416 -rrb- and pakistan -lrb- 320,767 -rrb- .
although the numbers suggest that the germans make up the fourth-largest group , the ippr study dubbed them third , excluding irish immigrants from their ranking . dw-world.de beck : ' germany is open to immigrants ' marieluise beck has been germany 's commissioner for integration for nearly seven years .

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .

partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?
as a conference on sustainable development begins in berlin , director of the un environment program klaus töpfer says katrina taught the world that it 's time for a new global energy policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2005 rebuilding a devastated city großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says after the onslaught by hurricane katrina , the city of new orleans practically ceased to exist .
prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.09.2005 berlin festival tops literary calendar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature taking center stage berlin 's international literature festival kicked off this week .
by offering something for everyone , organizers hope the event can keep its reputation as the " mother of all literary festivals . " germany is not lacking in literary festivals .
leipzig reads , litcologne , and the aachen storytelling festival are three of the bigger ones . but the jewel in the crown of the german literary season is the international literature festival berlin , or ilb . as festivals go , the ilb certainly does n't lack for ambition . more than 100 authors will take part in 300 separate events over the course of 12 days .
these include book and poetry readings , author appearances and political discussions , in dozens of sites throughout the city . in 2004 , organizers said that they hosted 35,500 visitors ; they are expecting a similar number this year .
that may be smaller than the international book festival in edinburgh , which had had 220,000 visitors , 500 authors and 650 events over two weeks this year .
but it is still a huge undertaking , with a large turnout . international , political the festival has two main sections , literatures of the world and kaleidescope .
the literatures of the world invitees were nominated by a jury of well known authors .
with writers coming from every continent , this section fo the festival seems likely to live up to its name .
kaleidescope authors were invited expressly by the festival organizers , and the focus is on literature that deals with current cultural and political developments.their appearances are supported by an international network of sponsors and friends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drowning in literature while some people say reading is a dying art , the ilb apparently sees things differently . the international children ’ s and youth literature program has diverse readings and exhibitions for kids , while the scritture giovani project encourages young european authors . for 2005 , scritture giovani - a cooperation between several large european literary festivals - has asked five young authors from different countries to write a short story on the theme of “ elsewhere . ”
these will be presented at various literature festivals , and later published in a single , five-language volume . spotlight on california every year , the festival highlights a geographic region .
this time , california is in the spotlight . moving away from the clichés of hippies , hollywood and schwarzenegger , the show wants to offer a overview of the literary life of the golden state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : california expert kevin starr " if america did n't have california , the psyche of the nation would be different , " said kevin starr , a historian who has written about the state and is known as california 's " living archives . " an important force in american creativity would be lost , then . " another guest of the festival is steve wasserman , former features editor of the los angeles times , a well-known intellectual and pulizer prize juror .
he complained before the festival that too few us newspapers publish book reviews or news about literature . " it is one of the big scandals of american journalism … we are failing our readers , " he said .
the festival runs until sept .

she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .

a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "

britain urged the european union on wednesday to toughen up its fight against terrorism , and reassess its human rights laws that prevent the deportation of suspected terrorists . british home secretary charles clarke urged eu officials on wednesday to reevaluate the balance between human rights and security in the age of global terrorism . it is now necessary " to balance these very important rights for individuals against the collective right for security against those who attack us through terrorist violence , " clarke told members of the european parliament .

the motto of the beethoven festival in 2005 is liberté . the beethoven festival in bonn may have dropped the " international " from its name , but its scope and line-up certainly remain so .
under the patronage of german president horst köhler , the sixty-four events and additional side events will take place from september 8 until october 2 at twenty-five locations in bonn , the city where ludwig van beethoven was born , as well as in the picturesque surrounding regions on the river rhine .
with the motto bohemia , last year ’ s festival looked towards the east .
in 2005 the motto is liberté , turning the focus to the west , or to be more precise , to france and its rich cultural heritage .
festival director ilona schmiel on the motto : " liberté is a key word of the french revolution .
there are many historical connections , including the two hundredth anniversary of friedrich schiller ’ s death in 1805 as well as the first performance of " fidelio " .
we will embark on a voyage through time to encounter the revolutionary ideas and music that had a great effect on beethoven , and we will present it to all visitors in a grand context .
one highlight is certainly the orchestre national de france with kurt masur and an all-french program .
we also have jean-yves thibaudet , lise de la salle , helène grimaud and of course the new york philharmonic with lorin maazel , but also a grand master of the calibre of alfred brendel . "
tradition and modernism ludwig van beethoven lived during the age of enlightenment .
this was a time of revolutionary ideas and social upheaval .
it was also the era when the first orchestras and music societies for middle-class citizens were founded .
but the beethoven festival is not primarily a museum of music history , as this year 's line-up includes eight newly commissioned works .
of course , much beethoven will be heard as well , including several cycles .
his thirty-two piano sonatas will be played by garrick ohlsson , andreas staier , louis lortie and bernd glemser .
in two recitals , the beaux arts trio will perform beethoven 's complete piano trios .
the programme also includes all of beethoven 's late string quartets .
on that subject : building on last year 's experience of the " long night of the pianos , " this time a " long night of the string quartets " will be a big attraction .
and on september the 25th , two hundred years to the day after the premiere of " fidelio " .
beethoven 's only opera will be staged at the bonn opera house in a new production by director günter krämer .
fostering young talent ! the orchestral campus , a collaboration with deutsche welle as media and co-partner of the beethoven festival , enters its fifth year in 2005 .
after ukraine , turkey , georgia and china in past seasons , this time the invitation went to an outstanding youth orchestra from poland .
coinciding with the current german-polish year 2005-2006 , the orchestra of the krakow music academy will be coming to bonn .
one of the highlights of this programme will be the world première of a work by the young polish composer agata zubel .
arts.21 will be presenting her in a portrait , just as we introduced the winners of the deutsche welle composition prize of the last two years who came from china and georgia .

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !

a week and a half after katrina wrought disaster on new orleans , mail continues to pour in from dw-world readers about the extent to which us policies can be held responsible and whether the us should accept foreign aid . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
i do believe that the us should accept german aid , and any other aid for that matter . the affected areas need all the help they can get . it 's mind-boggling to imagine that new orleans , la is now almost completely evacuated and 70 percent underwater . i live in north-central alabama ; the damage here was nowhere near what we see in coastal areas , thank god , but we have seen our share of storm damage with previous hurricanes and tornadoes . the damage in new orleans is unimaginable - we have to put politics aside and help these people . us policy should n't be at issue now - saving lives should be . placing blame for natural disasters does n't help anyone . especially for people who are not directly affected , it is a cynical and monumental waste of time . - joshua hood i think it is a sad time and the us is quite hypocritical to be taking aid from outside the country .
i am a physician who has trained and is familiar with disaster preparedness .
i am licensed to practice medicine and i am certified in advanced trauma life support .
i am also a physician in the air national guard .
i have made all kinds of inquiries with my state and local officials and have spoken personally with officials in baton rouge .
and yet i have not been called up by my national guard unit and i can not get on a team from my area .
it appears that to be able to help , one has to be a politician .
it appears as though the politicians and policy-makers are exploiting the situation by showing up in the disaster-torn area to look the part of providing relief rather than being in washington making the right decisions and policies and executing them properly to prevent the kind of catastrophe that we see unfolding in the gulf region .
one wonders if the senator from tennessee is using his unique position as physician and senator to show up for a photo op for a future run for president .
he could do better by clearing up the bureaucracy and allowing the us physicians to tend to the needs of the people in this disaster . - angela walker do you believe that attacks on us environmental policy are justified in the aftermath of the hurricane katrina ?
in a simple word , no , they are not ; i find it disgusting that german officials would make such comments .
not sure what they hope to gain by their silly comments .
us and german relations are at an all time low , and personally , having been born in germany , find no love whatsoever for my former country .
to blame us policies and to suggest that they were somehow responsible for katrina is ludicrous .
do n't you people have better things to do ? - werner , usa i think this was a very sad natural disaster and all nations should have solidarity and give support to the us .
this event may have or may have not been triggered by the weather changes due to pollution .
but just in case of those kinds of disasters and for the benefit of humankind , all nations should adhere to the kyoto treaty , foremost the usa , which is the most polluting nation in the world . - ana of course us policy is wrong ; it does affect canada .
this year we had the most humid and hot summer -lrb- over 40 days with the extreme heat alert ; it was unbelievably hot : smog and hot air and no rain for over 30 days and many seniors and people with respiratory system problems passed away prematurely .
and the problem with power supply - who are the culprits working overtime in the us and canada , and how many cars are there in toronto ?
maybe 2 million ?
i am fed up and i regret that i came to canada in 1981 and miss europe .
last year i visited berlin and got so mad when i landed at pearson into smog having boarded the plane in frankfurt , taking in some pristine air .
bush is ignoring the whole planet and we all are paying the price and it will be worse year by year .
but we are helpless and there 's nothing we can do .
my country is canada now .
i am considering getting back to europe .
today in toronto the day is so beautiful , the air is crisp , the sky is blue and the trees are green , so after finishing this i 'll run to lake ontario and sit on a stone at the " beach " and contemplate . - grazyna maria krol yes , the us should accept german help !
we are adults -lrb- well , most of the time -rrb- and the people and government of the us should accept aid from those who offer it .
the aid is for the people adversely affected by katrina .
those government officials that blocked the aid from other countries , and germany in particular , have a lot of ' brass ' do so when there are many people who would love to receive it and really need it .
to prevent such aid at any level is infantile ! - thomas clark , portland , oregon , usa yes , the us should definitely accept any help from any country willing to send aid .
but as seen from the posted article , there was some " hesitation " from us officials , and the on-going criminal enterprise that constitutes the bush administration would rather stubbornly and stupidly refuse help offered by countries like venezuela and cuba , and let their poor african-american citizens die , than suspend their ideological hatred of countries they can not bully into going along with their international war crime sprees .
hopefully the rage of conscientious americans will now drive these criminals from power . - neil murray , bellows falls , vermont the world reaction to katrina is what one would expect .
not only is it a reaction to the us ' obstinate lack of environmental concern , but also an incomprehensible lack of us emergency preparedness and organization . - dr. karl kettler do you think that world reaction so far to the devastation caused by katrina has been cold-hearted ?
that is a tough one - indifferent is more like it .
though the aid was offered from countries one would not normally think would offer aid .
i guess that 's just the reality of the world , we are the bad guy , the cause of global warming , etc .
the reaction of our government leaves a lot to be desired , too slow in coming ; pre-planning and coordinating was shoddy at best .
though it is hard to predict the outcome of a hurricane , the armchair quarterbacks are now having a field day as to what went wrong and how it should have been done .
all we can do now is learn and get help to all of our citizens in need as quickly as possible .
and really plan for a future hurricane strike , for it 's just a matter of time before the next one strikes .
the biggest disappointment was our neighbor to the north , canada .
it took them four days to even call our president to offer some help .
if the tables were turned i know we would have been at the border asking what can we do to help .
such is life . - werner , charleston , usa compiled by dw staff send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?

this time , british prime minister tony blair , who holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was accompanied by european commission president jose barroso , as well as a host of commissioners and business leaders - a delegation befitting a nation that is widely regarded as one of the world 's up-and-coming economic powers . the summit , which saw the signing of a so-called " action plan " setting out the way forward in political , trade and investment , economic , and cultural and academic relations , effectively put india on a par with other eu partners such as us , china and russia . " it is in my opinion long overdue , " said blair , referring to the joint action plan .
" it sets a framework for more action on a whole range of issues … such as science and technology . " indian prime minister manmohan singh was equally upbeat about the talks with european leaders . " we had extremely good and productive discussions , " the indian premier said .

the aircraft would boost the fleet of state-run indian airlines , which mainly flies domestic routes but also heads to some regional , middle eastern and southeast asian destinations . the indian airlines board had agreed on the acquisition of 20 airbus a-319s , 19 a-321s and four a-320s more than two years ago but a final decision had been delayed by required clearances from several layers of the government because of the order 's size . a ministerial panel led by finance minister p. chidambaram held final price negotiations on tuesday with airbus for the purchase of the 43 planes .

cdu leader and frontrunner for chancellor in germany 's upcoming general election angela merkel has hinted in the past that she would pursue nuclear technology export deals with both india and china , where atomic energy is a booming industry . schäuble 's comments drew criticism from germany 's free-market liberal party , the fdp , as well as environmentalists , who point to the fact that india engaged in controversial weapons testing in 1998 and has never signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . the fdp 's parliamentary leader wolfgang gerhardt warned that supplying india with nuclear technology would only serve to " strengthen the iranians , " at a time when the eu is struggling to convince iran to abandon its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimistic india meets pessimistic germany as german industry begins to wake up to the endless opportunities in the vast expanse of india , indian companies are slowly but surely tapping into germany .

sale of the oil , which germany and 26 other countries agreed to free up earlier this week , started in rotterdam wednesday .
germany 's decision to join other international energy agency nations and put emergency reserves on the market was not merely out of solidarity with the devastated us region , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
it was a necessary bid to calm oil prices in the wake of the disaster .

" we ’ re assuming that this oil will create a sufficient energy supply on the market and also reduce the pressure on oil prices , " schröder told reporters .
questioning the sale but some experts , like bernhard hillibrand from the rwi essen research institute , said releasing oil reserves won ’ t necessarily solve the problem .
" you can release oil supplies for two months , for example .
but what nobody can say for sure is if this will bring down the prices at the same time .
impulse buying might cause them to rise , " he noted .
numerous politicians have accused the oil and gas industries of unscrupulously profiting from pressured oil production due to the ongoing iraq war and now the disasterous hurricane in the united states .
in possible his last state-of-the-nation address ahead of national elections sept .

schröder called it a " strategy doomed to failure . "

" it is unsure whether the tie between oil and gas prices is really justified under current conditions , " schröder said during a speech in the bundestag .
consumer affairs minister renate künast did not beat around the bush .
" the coupling of natural gas -lrb- and oil -rrb- prices must finally be abolished , " künast told bild newspaper on wednesday .
" russian gas has nothing to do with arabian oil . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast schröder and künast have said they would like the federal cartel office to look into the matter .
in germany , oil and natural gas prices have been linked since the 1960s .
but finance minister hans eichel commented that a decoupling would n't change much , because energy prices have risen in general .
by the end of this year , natural gas prices are expected to have increased by 15 percent since december .
schröder 's social democratic colleague and party head franz müntefering said he doubted such a decoupling would be effective and noted that price linking was connected to international agreements that have been around for decades . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un calls for reduced oil dependency as a conference on sustainable development begins in berlin , director of the un environment program klaus töpfer says katrina taught the world that it 's time for a new global energy policy .

" " that 's why you 're finished , " she said . merkel 's lead shrinking following sunday 's debate , though , merkel 's once substantial lead over schröder has shrunk , according to a poll by the forsa research institute .
on wednesday , surveys showed she may not achieve her goal of a center-right coalition . the forsa poll carried out immediately after sunday 's debate showed a coalition of merkel 's cdu and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- winning a combined 48 percent of the vote , one point less than the total of all other parties . a separate survey by pollsters emnid gave merkel 's coalition a one-point lead .

prominent german architect albert speer talked to dw-world about the prospects of rebuilding a destroyed city . dw-world : hurricane katrina destroyed large portions of new orleans and flooded some 80 percent of the city .
is it possible - under such extraordinary circumstances - to rebuild a city like new orleans ? albert speer : it 's a big problem if you try to rebuild new orleans as it was .
i think the most important thing is that the players have to think far into the future .
the old infrastructure of new orleans was in a very bad condition .
rebuilding a city like new orleans needs new ideas , a rethinking of what a modern city in the 21st century is , with new , much more modern infrastructure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuild , just better , speer says will it be possible to salvage any of the infrastructure in new orleans ? i am not sure if you can really save parts of the infrastructure .
i think you have to modernize all of it .
new orleans is a city with a rich and colorful history .
how could one restore the spirit and the character of the city ? this is a minor problem .
you could restore and rebuild parts like the french quarter - this was done in europe after the second world war , and in other parts of the world .
that is only a small part of new orleans , though .
this is a city of about 600,000 people .
there , you have to take a mega step into the future , with new constructions , new ways of thinking about -lrb- communities -rrb- , the economy and all other fields . bildunterschrift : keep the spirit , lose the slums , speer says would it not be simpler and much cheaper to build a completely new city in a spot which would be not so prone to flooding ? most of new orleans is below sea level . the precautions taken were n't what they could have been .
partially , it could be a good idea to resettle people in a new location .
still , with a city with this much tradition , i do n't think it 's a good idea to give it up .
parts of the city could be developed in better locations .
but there is also the problem of property ownership .
i would say that the old part of the city , the city center , the french quarter , all these areas have to be rebuilt .
but , as you know , new orleans also had its slum quarters with very low standards .
people have to think of not rebuilding these areas . a us city has never suffered such a massive devastation .
can america learn from other countries , like germany , that had to rebuild cities that were completely destroyed after world war ii ? learning is a too big word .
it is not really comparable because the technical infrastructure in europe has completely different standards than in the us , and the construction of houses in the us is completely different .
nearly all the houses in the us are built out of wood .
the construction is very light , but is easily destroyed by a hurricane . brian pickering interviewed albert speer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us policy at fault for katrina ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.09.2005 helping scientists juggle kids and career großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist nüsslein-volhard : " a good researcher can not be replaced " women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .
a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics . nobel prize-winning biologist christiane nüsslein-volhard caused a stir last year when she set up a foundation to fund women scientists .
she decided to give money to dedicated researchers who were also young mothers , and who were having trouble managing career and family .
from a pool of 99 applications , the christiane nüsslein-volhard foundation selcted five women : three physicists , an astronomer , and a biologist .
all of them have at least one child between the ages of five months and four years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab animals ca n't always wait starting in september , each of the selected scientists will get 400 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month for a year .
the stipend is renewable for up to three years .
the funds are not meant to be used for supplies or materials , but rather for babysitting , domestic help - even a washing machine .
anything goes , as long as it can help women devote more time to scientific research .
different problems of course , it 's not only women scientists who dream of being freed from household duties to get ahead in their careers .
but women scientists who also raise children " have different problems than someone in , say , law or marketing , " said sabine list , the nüsslein-volhard foundation ’ s public relations manager .
" if you are a biologist and you set up cell cultures , they don ’ t wait for you .
just because your child ’ s daycare closes at 4:00 doesn ’ t mean the culture will be ready at 3:30 .
they might not be ready until 5 , so that 's when you have to be at the lab , " list said .
many researchers are on small stipends and can ’ t afford to pay for additional childcare outside daytime hours or for a babysitter so they can present a paper at a conference - another must for success in the scientific world .
" we ’ re just trying to help them be more flexible , " list said .
the idea for the foundation came about after nüsslein-volhard , who heads the max-planck institute for developmental biology in tübingen , noticed her gifted research assistants tended to drop out of science once they had children .
nüsslein-volhard felt that simply replacing one researcher with another would n't be a satisfactory solution .
individuality at a premium this is due to the individual nature of the work , nüsslein-volhard told " spiegel online " in august .
" it 's not a normal , routine job , like teacher or doctor .
a good researcher simply can not be replaced by someone else , because each scientist creates her own work , asks her own set of questions .
setting one 's own goals is the hallmark of scientific research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work in a genetics lab women scientists in germany face a lot of hurdles ; statistics show they have less success in terms of career advancement than in most other european countries .
according to european union data from 2003 , 30 percent of german college and university students enrolled in the natural sciences were women - one of the lowest rates in all europe .
at the same time , only 6 percent of full professorships in germany were held by women .
full professorships are often used as a benchmark of success in scientific academia , and are useful since they are statistically tracked .
leaky pipeline inken lind , a researcher at the center of excellence women in science -lrb- cews -rrb- in bonn , confirmed that there is a " noticeable imbalance " between the achievements of women and men in science .
what 's more , as the jobs get more important and better paid , that gap increases - a phenomenon referred to as the " leaky pipeline . "
" concretely , this means in germany - much more than in other countries - women with the same qualifications have a much lower chance of having a scientific career than men , " lind said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biologist at work often , the pipeline begins to leak most when women become mothers .
nüsslein-volhard , who won the nobel prize for medicine in 1995 , blames this phenomenon on the country ’ s conservative attitudes - and policies - surrounding child-rearing .
" in germany , there is simply a societal problem .
women who have children and work full days are considered strange , and they have trouble finding full-time care , " she told the newspaper die tageszeitung .
political issues indeed , politicians have spent the past few years grappling with issues such as all-day schools and expanded daycare for small children .
compared with most other european countries , germany is considered unfriendly toward working mothers on these topics .
over the past decade , the scientific community has worked hard to address the imbalances . mentoring programs have mushroomed , while federal and local monies have been directed into programs aimed at helping women in the field .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german science ca n't afford losing talented women these measures have met with some success .
the numbers of female science professors have been growing over the last decade , and there are now more women professors than at any time in the country 's history . so far , though , the nüsslein-vollhard foundation has been the first to try to achieve parity by financing household appliances . lost opportunity cews ' lind says it 's important to realize promoting women 's role in science is a question of equal opportunity , but also much more than that .
" there are profound reasons to continue increasing the number of women professors , " lind said .
" on the one hand , greater input from women ... would give a different perspective to science , " she said , noting recent acknowledgement of a longstanding ' male bias ’ in pharmaceutical and medical research .
financial resources are also at stake .
many women study for years at publicly funded german universities , then step off the career ladder because their country is not family-friendly .
for germany , " the loss of highly qualified scientists leads to a shrinking pool of human resources that german science can ’ t afford in the long run .
not if it wants to stay internationally competitive .

what is born abroad ?
born abroad is a database of figures about immigrants in britain , where they come from and where they live .
it also includes statistics about the economic performance of different immigrant groups .
where have the figures come from ?
the database has been produced by bbc news from a report on immigration , published by the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a think tank .
the report is largely based on data from the uk census , a huge survey carried out every decade and last conducted in 2001 .
one of the census questions asks people where they were born .
all the answers were collated for the ippr by an expert team within the geography department at sheffield university .
the answers were also applied to maps of britain , so concentrations of different immigrant groups could be identified .
most of born abroad consists of those collated figures - with some extra processing by the bbc to produce , for example , percentage change data - and the maps .
on top of that , the ippr report used figures from the labour force survey -lrb- lfs -rrb- , which are in turn used in the economics section of born abroad .
the lfs is a quarterly survey of 60,000 households that includes questions on personal details such as age and country of birth , and also collects data including earnings and employment status .
five years of labour force surveys -lrb- 2000-2004 -rrb- were used by the ippr to provide a large enough number of immigrants to analyse .
unlike some other surveys , census and lfs data includes all foreign-born people regardless of how long they have been in the uk , how much longer they intend to stay in the uk or their immigration status .
some people do not participate in the census , but the office for national statistics adjusts the figures to take that into account .
statisticians consider the census to be the most accurate source of information available on the size and composition of the uk population .
it includes children .
how should born abroad be used ?
born abroad is split into four sections that can be browsed via four separate tabs at the top of the page .
" overview " is the introduction and contains figures and maps for britain as a whole .
" around britain " gives an overview of the figures for england 's nine regions plus scotland and wales , and provides links to individual pages for each , which contain figures at a much more detailed local level .
" countries of birth " contains the figures categorised according to where immigrants were born , and provides links to individual country pages where further detail is available .
" economics " contains separately sourced data on the employment and wage levels of different immigrant groups .
many of the tables in born abroad can be sorted by clicking on the column titles .
what geography has been used ?
the figures in born abroad can be viewed for britain as a whole and then for england 's nine regions , plus scotland and wales -lrb- see map below -rrb- .
on the individual pages for each region and scotland and wales , accessed from the " around britain " tab , figures are available for the numbers of people born outside the british isles at more local level .
these are based on a unique unit , which sheffield university called a " tract " and born abroad calls a local area .
they were needed in order to provide a consistent geography over time .
they do not exactly match any existing geographic units such as local council areas , parliamentary constituencies or electoral wards because their boundaries change over time as populations shift .
all 1,282 local areas have similar-sized populations and are roughly equivalent to half a parliamentary constituency .
all have been labelled using easily recognisable names .
how do the maps work ?
two types of map are used in born abroad , standard -lrb- below left -rrb- and cartographic -lrb- below right -rrb- , which are always shown alongside each other with the same information in them .
the cartographic maps are made up of small squares , each of which represents an area of roughly equal population size .
as a result , densely populated areas - like london - take up much more space than sparsely populated areas , like the scottish highlands .
the cartographic maps make it is easier to see the information being displayed for the densely populated areas .
to help understanding , you can choose whether to have britain 's cities labelled or not using the tickbox .
why are most of the figures from 1991 and 2001 only ?
the last census took place in 2001 , so it is the source of the most up-to-date figures .
the census before that was carried out in 1991 , so that has been used to allow for comparisons over time .
on the " overview " tab figures from the 1971 and 1981 census have also been used to provide a national comparison over a longer period .
on the " economics " tab the figures are from labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
why are some places of birth included and others not ?
separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census .
where countries are not listed separately , they have been grouped together with others in the same region , and given appropriate titles .
what do the labels like " other south and e africa " mean ?
because separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census , some are grouped together and given labels like this .
so , for example , " other south & e africa " consists of 21 separate countries : angola , botswana , burundi , comoros , djibouti , ethiopia , lesotho , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , mozambique , namibia , reunion , rwanda , st. helena & dependencies , seychelles , swaziland , tanzania , uganda , zambia and eritrea .
for a definition of all the group labels , see their individual pages linked off the " countries of birth " tab .
what does " as % of all people " mean ?
these figures show what percentage of the total population in britain , in a region or in a local area -lrb- depending on the table being viewed -rrb- consists of people born outside the british isles .
for example , on the " regions " tab , on the table titled " distribution of people born abroad " , the top row shows that in 1991 in the east midlands 4.46 % of the total population was born outside the british isles , which went up to 5.38 % in 2001 , representing an increase of 0.92 % .
what does " + / - % " mean ?
it means percentage change .
if the relevant figure has gone down , it will show a minus sign before it , for example -0.15 .
if it has gone up , there will be no sign before it , for example 0.15 .
why do some tables have " n / a " in them ?
this has been used to indicate that the information is not available .
on the " around britain " and " countries of birth " tabs , it applies because the countries included in each census are not constant .
for example , the figure for afghanistan was not separately available from the 1991 census data but was in 2001 .
on the economics tab " n / a " is used where the sample size for the country in question was too small for the response to be considered meaningful .
what is the difference between " britain " and " british isles " ?
britain means england , wales and scotland .
the british isles means england , wales , scotland , northern ireland , the republic of ireland and islands such as the channel islands and the isle of man .
the answers to the census question asking where respondents were born have been categorised according to whether people were born inside or outside the british isles .
however , although the census covers all parts of the uk , responses from northern ireland have been left out of the figures -lrb- see next faq -rrb- , so in born abroad they apply to residents of britain only .
why is northern ireland not included in the regional pages ?
because there are no digital boundaries for northern ireland censuses prior to 2001 , meaning that it is not possible to compare results geographically over time .
why ca n't i just enter a postcode to find my area ?
because the data has been divided up at local level using a unique geographic unit -lrb- see above -rrb- , which does not match the postcode database we use with other sets of statistics , such as election results .
why are some countries on the " economics " tab not on other tabs , and vice versa ?
because they are from different sources .
the economic figures are from labour force surveys 2000-2004 , all other figures are from the censuses of 2001 and earlier .
what are " new immigrants " and " settled immigrants " ?
these terms are used on the " economics " tab , where the data is based on labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
new immigrants are those who arrived in the uk in the 15 years before the survey date .
so , for the labour force survey of 2004 , new immigrants were those who arrived in 1990 or later , settled immigrants were those who arrived in the uk before 1990 .
how are low and high earners defined ?
on the " economics " tab , low earners are people earning less than half the uk median wage , which over the time of the labour force surveys from which these figures were taken -lrb- 2000 to 2004 -rrb- , was £ 149.20 a week .
high earners are people earning more than £ 750 a week , which is one of the uk 's highest earning brackets .
what does n't born abroad show ?
the census figures that make up the bulk of born abroad only show the country people were born in , not their ethnicity or citizenship .
for example , the children of british military personnel born in germany will be included in the figures for germany , even though they are likely to be british .
also , the figures only reflect the picture up to 2001 , since when some significant events have had an impact on immigration to britain , including , for example , enlargement of the european union and the war in iraq .
the economic figures are more up-to-date , as they are based on labour force surveys up to 2004 .

if the relevant figure has gone down , it will show a minus sign before it , for example -0.15 .
if it has gone up , there will be no sign before it , for example 0.15 .
back to top why do some tables have " n / a " in them ?
this has been used to indicate that the information is not available .
on the " around britain " and " countries of birth " tabs , it applies because the countries included in each census are not constant .
for example , the figure for afghanistan was not separately available from the 1991 census data but was in 2001 .
on the economics tab " n / a " is used where the sample size for the country in question was too small for the response to be considered meaningful .
back to top what is the difference between " britain " and " british isles " ?
britain means england , wales and scotland .
the british isles means england , wales , scotland , northern ireland , the republic of ireland and islands such as the channel islands and the isle of man .
the answers to the census question asking where respondents were born have been categorised according to whether people were born inside or outside the british isles .
however , although the census covers all parts of the uk , responses from northern ireland have been left out of the figures -lrb- see next faq -rrb- , so in born abroad they apply to residents of britain only .
back to top why is northern ireland not included in the regional pages ?
because there are no digital boundaries for northern ireland censuses prior to 2001 , meaning that it is not possible to compare results geographically over time .
back to top why ca n't i just enter a postcode to find my area ?
because the data has been divided up at local level using a unique geographic unit -lrb- see above -rrb- , which does not match the postcode database we use with other sets of statistics , such as election results .
back to top why are some countries on the " economics " tab not on other tabs , and vice versa ?
because they are from different sources .
the economic figures are from labour force surveys 2000-2004 , all other figures are from the censuses of 2001 and earlier .
back to top what are " new immigrants " and " settled immigrants " ?
these terms are used on the " economics " tab , where the data is based on labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
new immigrants are those who arrived in the uk in the 15 years before the survey date .
so , for the labour force survey of 2004 , new immigrants were those who arrived in 1990 or later , settled immigrants were those who arrived in the uk before 1990 .
back to top how are low and high earners defined ?
on the " economics " tab , low earners are people earning less than half the uk median wage , which over the time of the labour force surveys from which these figures were taken -lrb- 2000 to 2004 -rrb- , was £ 149.20 a week .
high earners are people earning more than £ 750 a week , which is one of the uk 's highest earning brackets .
back to top what does n't born abroad show ?
the census figures that make up the bulk of born abroad only show the country people were born in , not their ethnicity or citizenship .
for example , the children of british military personnel born in germany will be included in the figures for germany , even though they are likely to be british .
also , the figures only reflect the picture up to 2001 , since when some significant events have had an impact on immigration to britain , including , for example , enlargement of the european union and the war in iraq .
the economic figures are more up-to-date , as they are based on labour force surveys up to 2004 .

what is born abroad ?
born abroad is a database of figures about immigrants in britain , where they come from and where they live .
it also includes statistics about the economic performance of different immigrant groups .
back to top where have the figures come from ?
the database has been produced by bbc news from a report on immigration , published by the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a think tank .
the report is largely based on data from the uk census , a huge survey carried out every decade and last conducted in 2001 .
one of the census questions asks people where they were born .
all the answers were collated for the ippr by an expert team within the geography department at sheffield university .
the answers were also applied to maps of britain , so concentrations of different immigrant groups could be identified .
most of born abroad consists of those collated figures - with some extra processing by the bbc to produce , for example , percentage change data - and the maps .
on top of that , the ippr report used figures from the labour force survey -lrb- lfs -rrb- , which are in turn used in the economics section of born abroad .
the lfs is a quarterly survey of 60,000 households that includes questions on personal details such as age and country of birth , and also collects data including earnings and employment status .
five years of labour force surveys -lrb- 2000-2004 -rrb- were used by the ippr to provide a large enough number of immigrants to analyse .
unlike some other surveys , census and lfs data includes all foreign-born people regardless of how long they have been in the uk , how much longer they intend to stay in the uk or their immigration status .
some people do not participate in the census , but the office for national statistics adjusts the figures to take that into account .
statisticians consider the census to be the most accurate source of information available on the size and composition of the uk population .
it includes children .
back to top how should born abroad be used ?
born abroad is split into four sections that can be browsed via four separate tabs at the top of the page .
" overview " is the introduction and contains figures and maps for britain as a whole .
" around britain " gives an overview of the figures for england 's nine regions plus scotland and wales , and provides links to individual pages for each , which contain figures at a much more detailed local level .
" countries of birth " contains the figures categorised according to where immigrants were born , and provides links to individual country pages where further detail is available .
" economics " contains separately sourced data on the employment and wage levels of different immigrant groups .
many of the tables in born abroad can be sorted by clicking on the column titles .
back to top what geography has been used ?
the figures in born abroad can be viewed for britain as a whole and then for england 's nine regions , plus scotland and wales -lrb- see map below -rrb- .
on the individual pages for each region and scotland and wales , accessed from the " around britain " tab , figures are available for the numbers of people born outside the british isles at more local level .
these are based on a unique unit , which sheffield university called a " tract " and born abroad calls a local area .
they were needed in order to provide a consistent geography over time .
they do not exactly match any existing geographic units such as local council areas , parliamentary constituencies or electoral wards because their boundaries change over time as populations shift .
all 1,282 local areas have similar-sized populations and are roughly equivalent to half a parliamentary constituency .
all have been labelled using easily recognisable names .
back to top how do the maps work ?
two types of map are used in born abroad , standard -lrb- below left -rrb- and cartographic -lrb- below right -rrb- , which are always shown alongside each other with the same information in them .
the cartographic maps are made up of small squares , each of which represents an area of roughly equal population size .
as a result , densely populated areas - like london - take up much more space than sparsely populated areas , like the scottish highlands .
the cartographic maps make it is easier to see the information being displayed for the densely populated areas .
to help understanding , you can choose whether to have britain 's cities labelled or not using the tickbox .
back to top why are most of the figures from 1991 and 2001 only ?
the last census took place in 2001 , so it is the source of the most up-to-date figures .
the census before that was carried out in 1991 , so that has been used to allow for comparisons over time .
on the " overview " tab figures from the 1971 and 1981 census have also been used to provide a national comparison over a longer period .
on the " economics " tab the figures are from labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
back to top why are some places of birth included and others not ?
separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census .
where countries are not listed separately , they have been grouped together with others in the same region , and given appropriate titles .
back to top what do the labels like " other south and e africa " mean ?
because separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census , some are grouped together and given labels like this .
so , for example , " other south & e africa " consists of 21 separate countries : angola , botswana , burundi , comoros , djibouti , ethiopia , lesotho , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , mozambique , namibia , reunion , rwanda , st. helena & dependencies , seychelles , swaziland , tanzania , uganda , zambia and eritrea .
for a definition of all the group labels , see their individual pages linked off the " countries of birth " tab .
back to top what does " as % of all people " mean ?
these figures show what percentage of the total population in britain , in a region or in a local area -lrb- depending on the table being viewed -rrb- consists of people born outside the british isles .
for example , on the " regions " tab , on the table titled " distribution of people born abroad " , the top row shows that in 1991 in the east midlands 4.46 % of the total population was born outside the british isles , which went up to 5.38 % in 2001 , representing an increase of 0.92 % .
back to top what does " + / - % " mean ?
it means percentage change .
if the relevant figure has gone down , it will show a minus sign before it , for example -0.15 .
if it has gone up , there will be no sign before it , for example 0.15 .
back to top why do some tables have " n / a " in them ?

it includes children .
back to top how should born abroad be used ?
born abroad is split into four sections that can be browsed via four separate tabs at the top of the page .
" overview " is the introduction and contains figures and maps for britain as a whole .
" around britain " gives an overview of the figures for england 's nine regions plus scotland and wales , and provides links to individual pages for each , which contain figures at a much more detailed local level .
" countries of birth " contains the figures categorised according to where immigrants were born , and provides links to individual country pages where further detail is available .
" economics " contains separately sourced data on the employment and wage levels of different immigrant groups .
many of the tables in born abroad can be sorted by clicking on the column titles .
back to top what geography has been used ?
the figures in born abroad can be viewed for britain as a whole and then for england 's nine regions , plus scotland and wales -lrb- see map below -rrb- .
on the individual pages for each region and scotland and wales , accessed from the " around britain " tab , figures are available for the numbers of people born outside the british isles at more local level .
these are based on a unique unit , which sheffield university called a " tract " and born abroad calls a local area .
they were needed in order to provide a consistent geography over time .
they do not exactly match any existing geographic units such as local council areas , parliamentary constituencies or electoral wards because their boundaries change over time as populations shift .
all 1,282 local areas have similar-sized populations and are roughly equivalent to half a parliamentary constituency .
all have been labelled using easily recognisable names .
back to top how do the maps work ?
two types of map are used in born abroad , standard -lrb- below left -rrb- and cartographic -lrb- below right -rrb- , which are always shown alongside each other with the same information in them .
the cartographic maps are made up of small squares , each of which represents an area of roughly equal population size .
as a result , densely populated areas - like london - take up much more space than sparsely populated areas , like the scottish highlands .
the cartographic maps make it is easier to see the information being displayed for the densely populated areas .
to help understanding , you can choose whether to have britain 's cities labelled or not using the tickbox .
back to top why are most of the figures from 1991 and 2001 only ?
the last census took place in 2001 , so it is the source of the most up-to-date figures .
the census before that was carried out in 1991 , so that has been used to allow for comparisons over time .
on the " overview " tab figures from the 1971 and 1981 census have also been used to provide a national comparison over a longer period .
on the " economics " tab the figures are from labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
back to top why are some places of birth included and others not ?
separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census .
where countries are not listed separately , they have been grouped together with others in the same region , and given appropriate titles .
back to top what do the labels like " other south and e africa " mean ?
because separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census , some are grouped together and given labels like this .
so , for example , " other south & e africa " consists of 21 separate countries : angola , botswana , burundi , comoros , djibouti , ethiopia , lesotho , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , mozambique , namibia , reunion , rwanda , st. helena & dependencies , seychelles , swaziland , tanzania , uganda , zambia and eritrea .
for a definition of all the group labels , see their individual pages linked off the " countries of birth " tab .
back to top what does " as % of all people " mean ?
these figures show what percentage of the total population in britain , in a region or in a local area -lrb- depending on the table being viewed -rrb- consists of people born outside the british isles .
for example , on the " regions " tab , on the table titled " distribution of people born abroad " , the top row shows that in 1991 in the east midlands 4.46 % of the total population was born outside the british isles , which went up to 5.38 % in 2001 , representing an increase of 0.92 % .
back to top what does " + / - % " mean ?
it means percentage change .
if the relevant figure has gone down , it will show a minus sign before it , for example -0.15 .
if it has gone up , there will be no sign before it , for example 0.15 .
back to top why do some tables have " n / a " in them ?
this has been used to indicate that the information is not available .
on the " around britain " and " countries of birth " tabs , it applies because the countries included in each census are not constant .
for example , the figure for afghanistan was not separately available from the 1991 census data but was in 2001 .
on the economics tab " n / a " is used where the sample size for the country in question was too small for the response to be considered meaningful .
back to top what is the difference between " britain " and " british isles " ?
britain means england , wales and scotland .
the british isles means england , wales , scotland , northern ireland , the republic of ireland and islands such as the channel islands and the isle of man .
the answers to the census question asking where respondents were born have been categorised according to whether people were born inside or outside the british isles .
however , although the census covers all parts of the uk , responses from northern ireland have been left out of the figures -lrb- see next faq -rrb- , so in born abroad they apply to residents of britain only .
back to top why is northern ireland not included in the regional pages ?
because there are no digital boundaries for northern ireland censuses prior to 2001 , meaning that it is not possible to compare results geographically over time .
back to top why ca n't i just enter a postcode to find my area ?
because the data has been divided up at local level using a unique geographic unit -lrb- see above -rrb- , which does not match the postcode database we use with other sets of statistics , such as election results .
back to top why are some countries on the " economics " tab not on other tabs , and vice versa ?
because they are from different sources .
the economic figures are from labour force surveys 2000-2004 , all other figures are from the censuses of 2001 and earlier .
back to top what are " new immigrants " and " settled immigrants " ?
these terms are used on the " economics " tab , where the data is based on labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
new immigrants are those who arrived in the uk in the 15 years before the survey date .
so , for the labour force survey of 2004 , new immigrants were those who arrived in 1990 or later , settled immigrants were those who arrived in the uk before 1990 .
back to top how are low and high earners defined ?
on the " economics " tab , low earners are people earning less than half the uk median wage , which over the time of the labour force surveys from which these figures were taken -lrb- 2000 to 2004 -rrb- , was £ 149.20 a week .
high earners are people earning more than £ 750 a week , which is one of the uk 's highest earning brackets .
back to top what does n't born abroad show ?
the census figures that make up the bulk of born abroad only show the country people were born in , not their ethnicity or citizenship .
for example , the children of british military personnel born in germany will be included in the figures for germany , even though they are likely to be british .
also , the figures only reflect the picture up to 2001 , since when some significant events have had an impact on immigration to britain , including , for example , enlargement of the european union and the war in iraq .
the economic figures are more up-to-date , as they are based on labour force surveys up to 2004 .

what is born abroad ?
born abroad is a database of figures about immigrants in britain , where they come from and where they live .
it also includes statistics about the economic performance of different immigrant groups .
back to top where have the figures come from ?
the database has been produced by bbc news from a report on immigration , published by the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a think tank .
the report is largely based on data from the uk census , a huge survey carried out every decade and last conducted in 2001 .
one of the census questions asks people where they were born .
all the answers were collated for the ippr by an expert team within the geography department at sheffield university .
the answers were also applied to maps of britain , so concentrations of different immigrant groups could be identified .
most of born abroad consists of those collated figures - with some extra processing by the bbc to produce , for example , percentage change data - and the maps .
on top of that , the ippr report used figures from the labour force survey -lrb- lfs -rrb- , which are in turn used in the economics section of born abroad .
the lfs is a quarterly survey of 60,000 households that includes questions on personal details such as age and country of birth , and also collects data including earnings and employment status .
five years of labour force surveys -lrb- 2000-2004 -rrb- were used by the ippr to provide a large enough number of immigrants to analyse .
unlike some other surveys , census and lfs data includes all foreign-born people regardless of how long they have been in the uk , how much longer they intend to stay in the uk or their immigration status .
some people do not participate in the census , but the office for national statistics adjusts the figures to take that into account .
statisticians consider the census to be the most accurate source of information available on the size and composition of the uk population .
it includes children .

the economic figures are more up-to-date , as they are based on labour force surveys up to 2004 .

what is born abroad ?
born abroad is a database of figures about immigrants in britain , where they come from and where they live .
it also includes statistics about the economic performance of different immigrant groups .
back to top where have the figures come from ?
the database has been produced by bbc news from a report on immigration , published by the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a think tank .
the report is largely based on data from the uk census , a huge survey carried out every decade and last conducted in 2001 .
one of the census questions asks people where they were born .
all the answers were collated for the ippr by an expert team within the geography department at sheffield university .
the answers were also applied to maps of britain , so concentrations of different immigrant groups could be identified .
most of born abroad consists of those collated figures - with some extra processing by the bbc to produce , for example , percentage change data - and the maps .
on top of that , the ippr report used figures from the labour force survey -lrb- lfs -rrb- , which are in turn used in the economics section of born abroad .
the lfs is a quarterly survey of 60,000 households that includes questions on personal details such as age and country of birth , and also collects data including earnings and employment status .
five years of labour force surveys -lrb- 2000-2004 -rrb- were used by the ippr to provide a large enough number of immigrants to analyse .
unlike some other surveys , census and lfs data includes all foreign-born people regardless of how long they have been in the uk , how much longer they intend to stay in the uk or their immigration status .
some people do not participate in the census , but the office for national statistics adjusts the figures to take that into account .
statisticians consider the census to be the most accurate source of information available on the size and composition of the uk population .
it includes children .
back to top how should born abroad be used ?
born abroad is split into four sections that can be browsed via four separate tabs at the top of the page .
" overview " is the introduction and contains figures and maps for britain as a whole .
" around britain " gives an overview of the figures for england 's nine regions plus scotland and wales , and provides links to individual pages for each , which contain figures at a much more detailed local level .
" countries of birth " contains the figures categorised according to where immigrants were born , and provides links to individual country pages where further detail is available .
" economics " contains separately sourced data on the employment and wage levels of different immigrant groups .
many of the tables in born abroad can be sorted by clicking on the column titles .
back to top what geography has been used ?
the figures in born abroad can be viewed for britain as a whole and then for england 's nine regions , plus scotland and wales -lrb- see map below -rrb- .
on the individual pages for each region and scotland and wales , accessed from the " around britain " tab , figures are available for the numbers of people born outside the british isles at more local level .
these are based on a unique unit , which sheffield university called a " tract " and born abroad calls a local area .
they were needed in order to provide a consistent geography over time .
they do not exactly match any existing geographic units such as local council areas , parliamentary constituencies or electoral wards because their boundaries change over time as populations shift .
all 1,282 local areas have similar-sized populations and are roughly equivalent to half a parliamentary constituency .
all have been labelled using easily recognisable names .
back to top how do the maps work ?
two types of map are used in born abroad , standard -lrb- below left -rrb- and cartographic -lrb- below right -rrb- , which are always shown alongside each other with the same information in them .
the cartographic maps are made up of small squares , each of which represents an area of roughly equal population size .
as a result , densely populated areas - like london - take up much more space than sparsely populated areas , like the scottish highlands .
the cartographic maps make it is easier to see the information being displayed for the densely populated areas .
to help understanding , you can choose whether to have britain 's cities labelled or not using the tickbox .
back to top why are most of the figures from 1991 and 2001 only ?
the last census took place in 2001 , so it is the source of the most up-to-date figures .
the census before that was carried out in 1991 , so that has been used to allow for comparisons over time .
on the " overview " tab figures from the 1971 and 1981 census have also been used to provide a national comparison over a longer period .
on the " economics " tab the figures are from labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
back to top why are some places of birth included and others not ?
separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census .
where countries are not listed separately , they have been grouped together with others in the same region , and given appropriate titles .
back to top what do the labels like " other south and e africa " mean ?
because separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census , some are grouped together and given labels like this .
so , for example , " other south & e africa " consists of 21 separate countries : angola , botswana , burundi , comoros , djibouti , ethiopia , lesotho , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , mozambique , namibia , reunion , rwanda , st. helena & dependencies , seychelles , swaziland , tanzania , uganda , zambia and eritrea .
for a definition of all the group labels , see their individual pages linked off the " countries of birth " tab .
back to top what does " as % of all people " mean ?
these figures show what percentage of the total population in britain , in a region or in a local area -lrb- depending on the table being viewed -rrb- consists of people born outside the british isles .
for example , on the " regions " tab , on the table titled " distribution of people born abroad " , the top row shows that in 1991 in the east midlands 4.46 % of the total population was born outside the british isles , which went up to 5.38 % in 2001 , representing an increase of 0.92 % .
back to top what does " + / - % " mean ?
it means percentage change .
if the relevant figure has gone down , it will show a minus sign before it , for example -0.15 .
if it has gone up , there will be no sign before it , for example 0.15 .
back to top why do some tables have " n / a " in them ?
this has been used to indicate that the information is not available .
on the " around britain " and " countries of birth " tabs , it applies because the countries included in each census are not constant .
for example , the figure for afghanistan was not separately available from the 1991 census data but was in 2001 .
on the economics tab " n / a " is used where the sample size for the country in question was too small for the response to be considered meaningful .
back to top what is the difference between " britain " and " british isles " ?
britain means england , wales and scotland .
the british isles means england , wales , scotland , northern ireland , the republic of ireland and islands such as the channel islands and the isle of man .
the answers to the census question asking where respondents were born have been categorised according to whether people were born inside or outside the british isles .
however , although the census covers all parts of the uk , responses from northern ireland have been left out of the figures -lrb- see next faq -rrb- , so in born abroad they apply to residents of britain only .
back to top why is northern ireland not included in the regional pages ?
because there are no digital boundaries for northern ireland censuses prior to 2001 , meaning that it is not possible to compare results geographically over time .
back to top why ca n't i just enter a postcode to find my area ?
because the data has been divided up at local level using a unique geographic unit -lrb- see above -rrb- , which does not match the postcode database we use with other sets of statistics , such as election results .
back to top why are some countries on the " economics " tab not on other tabs , and vice versa ?
because they are from different sources .
the economic figures are from labour force surveys 2000-2004 , all other figures are from the censuses of 2001 and earlier .
back to top what are " new immigrants " and " settled immigrants " ?
these terms are used on the " economics " tab , where the data is based on labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
new immigrants are those who arrived in the uk in the 15 years before the survey date .
so , for the labour force survey of 2004 , new immigrants were those who arrived in 1990 or later , settled immigrants were those who arrived in the uk before 1990 .
back to top how are low and high earners defined ?
on the " economics " tab , low earners are people earning less than half the uk median wage , which over the time of the labour force surveys from which these figures were taken -lrb- 2000 to 2004 -rrb- , was £ 149.20 a week .
high earners are people earning more than £ 750 a week , which is one of the uk 's highest earning brackets .
back to top what does n't born abroad show ?
the census figures that make up the bulk of born abroad only show the country people were born in , not their ethnicity or citizenship .
for example , the children of british military personnel born in germany will be included in the figures for germany , even though they are likely to be british .
also , the figures only reflect the picture up to 2001 , since when some significant events have had an impact on immigration to britain , including , for example , enlargement of the european union and the war in iraq .
the economic figures are more up-to-date , as they are based on labour force surveys up to 2004 .

so , for example , " other south & e africa " consists of 21 separate countries : angola , botswana , burundi , comoros , djibouti , ethiopia , lesotho , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , mozambique , namibia , reunion , rwanda , st. helena & dependencies , seychelles , swaziland , tanzania , uganda , zambia and eritrea .
for a definition of all the group labels , see their individual pages linked off the " countries of birth " tab .
back to top what does " as % of all people " mean ?
these figures show what percentage of the total population in britain , in a region or in a local area -lrb- depending on the table being viewed -rrb- consists of people born outside the british isles .
for example , on the " regions " tab , on the table titled " distribution of people born abroad " , the top row shows that in 1991 in the east midlands 4.46 % of the total population was born outside the british isles , which went up to 5.38 % in 2001 , representing an increase of 0.92 % .
back to top what does " + / - % " mean ?
it means percentage change .
if the relevant figure has gone down , it will show a minus sign before it , for example -0.15 .
if it has gone up , there will be no sign before it , for example 0.15 .
back to top why do some tables have " n / a " in them ?
this has been used to indicate that the information is not available .
on the " around britain " and " countries of birth " tabs , it applies because the countries included in each census are not constant .
for example , the figure for afghanistan was not separately available from the 1991 census data but was in 2001 .
on the economics tab " n / a " is used where the sample size for the country in question was too small for the response to be considered meaningful .
back to top what is the difference between " britain " and " british isles " ?
britain means england , wales and scotland .
the british isles means england , wales , scotland , northern ireland , the republic of ireland and islands such as the channel islands and the isle of man .
the answers to the census question asking where respondents were born have been categorised according to whether people were born inside or outside the british isles .
however , although the census covers all parts of the uk , responses from northern ireland have been left out of the figures -lrb- see next faq -rrb- , so in born abroad they apply to residents of britain only .
back to top why is northern ireland not included in the regional pages ?
because there are no digital boundaries for northern ireland censuses prior to 2001 , meaning that it is not possible to compare results geographically over time .
back to top why ca n't i just enter a postcode to find my area ?
because the data has been divided up at local level using a unique geographic unit -lrb- see above -rrb- , which does not match the postcode database we use with other sets of statistics , such as election results .
back to top why are some countries on the " economics " tab not on other tabs , and vice versa ?
because they are from different sources .
the economic figures are from labour force surveys 2000-2004 , all other figures are from the censuses of 2001 and earlier .
back to top what are " new immigrants " and " settled immigrants " ?
these terms are used on the " economics " tab , where the data is based on labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
new immigrants are those who arrived in the uk in the 15 years before the survey date .
so , for the labour force survey of 2004 , new immigrants were those who arrived in 1990 or later , settled immigrants were those who arrived in the uk before 1990 .
back to top how are low and high earners defined ?
on the " economics " tab , low earners are people earning less than half the uk median wage , which over the time of the labour force surveys from which these figures were taken -lrb- 2000 to 2004 -rrb- , was £ 149.20 a week .
high earners are people earning more than £ 750 a week , which is one of the uk 's highest earning brackets .
back to top what does n't born abroad show ?
the census figures that make up the bulk of born abroad only show the country people were born in , not their ethnicity or citizenship .
for example , the children of british military personnel born in germany will be included in the figures for germany , even though they are likely to be british .
also , the figures only reflect the picture up to 2001 , since when some significant events have had an impact on immigration to britain , including , for example , enlargement of the european union and the war in iraq .
the economic figures are more up-to-date , as they are based on labour force surveys up to 2004 .

what is born abroad ?
born abroad is a database of figures about immigrants in britain , where they come from and where they live .
it also includes statistics about the economic performance of different immigrant groups .
back to top where have the figures come from ?
the database has been produced by bbc news from a report on immigration , published by the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , a think tank .
the report is largely based on data from the uk census , a huge survey carried out every decade and last conducted in 2001 .
one of the census questions asks people where they were born .
all the answers were collated for the ippr by an expert team within the geography department at sheffield university .
the answers were also applied to maps of britain , so concentrations of different immigrant groups could be identified .
most of born abroad consists of those collated figures - with some extra processing by the bbc to produce , for example , percentage change data - and the maps .
on top of that , the ippr report used figures from the labour force survey -lrb- lfs -rrb- , which are in turn used in the economics section of born abroad .
the lfs is a quarterly survey of 60,000 households that includes questions on personal details such as age and country of birth , and also collects data including earnings and employment status .
five years of labour force surveys -lrb- 2000-2004 -rrb- were used by the ippr to provide a large enough number of immigrants to analyse .
unlike some other surveys , census and lfs data includes all foreign-born people regardless of how long they have been in the uk , how much longer they intend to stay in the uk or their immigration status .
some people do not participate in the census , but the office for national statistics adjusts the figures to take that into account .
statisticians consider the census to be the most accurate source of information available on the size and composition of the uk population .
it includes children .
back to top how should born abroad be used ?
born abroad is split into four sections that can be browsed via four separate tabs at the top of the page .
" overview " is the introduction and contains figures and maps for britain as a whole .
" around britain " gives an overview of the figures for england 's nine regions plus scotland and wales , and provides links to individual pages for each , which contain figures at a much more detailed local level .
" countries of birth " contains the figures categorised according to where immigrants were born , and provides links to individual country pages where further detail is available .
" economics " contains separately sourced data on the employment and wage levels of different immigrant groups .
many of the tables in born abroad can be sorted by clicking on the column titles .
back to top what geography has been used ?
the figures in born abroad can be viewed for britain as a whole and then for england 's nine regions , plus scotland and wales -lrb- see map below -rrb- .
on the individual pages for each region and scotland and wales , accessed from the " around britain " tab , figures are available for the numbers of people born outside the british isles at more local level .
these are based on a unique unit , which sheffield university called a " tract " and born abroad calls a local area .
they were needed in order to provide a consistent geography over time .
they do not exactly match any existing geographic units such as local council areas , parliamentary constituencies or electoral wards because their boundaries change over time as populations shift .
all 1,282 local areas have similar-sized populations and are roughly equivalent to half a parliamentary constituency .
all have been labelled using easily recognisable names .
back to top how do the maps work ?
two types of map are used in born abroad , standard -lrb- below left -rrb- and cartographic -lrb- below right -rrb- , which are always shown alongside each other with the same information in them .
the cartographic maps are made up of small squares , each of which represents an area of roughly equal population size .
as a result , densely populated areas - like london - take up much more space than sparsely populated areas , like the scottish highlands .
the cartographic maps make it is easier to see the information being displayed for the densely populated areas .
to help understanding , you can choose whether to have britain 's cities labelled or not using the tickbox .
back to top why are most of the figures from 1991 and 2001 only ?
the last census took place in 2001 , so it is the source of the most up-to-date figures .
the census before that was carried out in 1991 , so that has been used to allow for comparisons over time .
on the " overview " tab figures from the 1971 and 1981 census have also been used to provide a national comparison over a longer period .
on the " economics " tab the figures are from labour force surveys conducted between 2000 and 2004 .
back to top why are some places of birth included and others not ?
separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census .
where countries are not listed separately , they have been grouped together with others in the same region , and given appropriate titles .
back to top what do the labels like " other south and e africa " mean ?
because separate figures for every country of birth are not available from the census , some are grouped together and given labels like this .
so , for example , " other south & e africa " consists of 21 separate countries : angola , botswana , burundi , comoros , djibouti , ethiopia , lesotho , madagascar , malawi , mauritius , mozambique , namibia , reunion , rwanda , st. helena & dependencies , seychelles , swaziland , tanzania , uganda , zambia and eritrea .
for a definition of all the group labels , see their individual pages linked off the " countries of birth " tab .
back to top what does " as % of all people " mean ?
these figures show what percentage of the total population in britain , in a region or in a local area -lrb- depending on the table being viewed -rrb- consists of people born outside the british isles .
for example , on the " regions " tab , on the table titled " distribution of people born abroad " , the top row shows that in 1991 in the east midlands 4.46 % of the total population was born outside the british isles , which went up to 5.38 % in 2001 , representing an increase of 0.92 % .
back to top what does " + / - % " mean ?
it means percentage change .
if the relevant figure has gone down , it will show a minus sign before it , for example -0.15 .
if it has gone up , there will be no sign before it , for example 0.15 .
back to top why do some tables have " n / a " in them ?
this has been used to indicate that the information is not available .
on the " around britain " and " countries of birth " tabs , it applies because the countries included in each census are not constant .
for example , the figure for afghanistan was not separately available from the 1991 census data but was in 2001 .
on the economics tab " n / a " is used where the sample size for the country in question was too small for the response to be considered meaningful .
back to top what is the difference between " britain " and " british isles " ?
britain means england , wales and scotland .
the british isles means england , wales , scotland , northern ireland , the republic of ireland and islands such as the channel islands and the isle of man .
the answers to the census question asking where respondents were born have been categorised according to whether people were born inside or outside the british isles .

the born abroad maps and figures aim to be both a snapshot of what was happening in 2001 while also providing a sense of the recent history of migration .
but what are some of the key issues that have affected migration in and out of the uk since then ?
immigration figures it 's virtually impossible to accurately say how many people come to live in the uk on a permanent or semi-permanent basis on a yearly basis because of the various ways people are allowed to come in and the procedures available to them to apply to settle .
in simple terms , someone arriving one year on a temporary work permit , may be later granted a right to permanently stay - the difficulty is in avoiding counting that person twice .
in general terms , the number of people coming for at least one year , in relation to the number of people who were leaving , has been going up since 1987 .
in 1999-2000 100,000 more people came for a year than left , before reaching a high of 171,000 in 2001 .
that figure has dropped back since .
another key measure is the figure for people giving " grants of settlement " - a right to stay permanently in the uk .
this figure has been tracking the general trend and came to about 144,000 in 2004 .
it excludes eu nationals who generally have an automatic right to stay under the free market rules that allow british citizens to do the same on the continent .
students a key part of the picture is university students .
major institutions - and smaller ones too - regard foreign students as a key resource because they pay higher fees than the institutions get for british students .
about 300,000 a year come at present and many universities are establishing formal links with other counties .
students account for some of the greatest diversity to be seen in urban areas : our maps show some that some of the largest clusters of people born abroad are in neighbourhoods with university halls of residence .
asylum seekers the rise in the number of asylum seekers was the trigger for the ongoing controversy about migration - but in reality their numbers have fluctuated wildly over the past 10 years but generally in line with international trends .
the high point for asylum applications -lrb- excluding dependents -rrb- was 84,000 in 2002 , since when it has fallen .
the bbc news website archive includes a large number of stories detailing the changes over the years .
general population at the census , the population of the uk was 58,789,194 .
the latest estimate , published a week before born abroad was published , is 59.8m.
the figures suggest that the uk population will very soon top 60m , in line with predictions .
migration is an important part of this population growth ; as our born abroad figures show , those coming from abroad accounted for half of population growth between 1991 and 2001 .
the office for national statistics estimates that net migration -lrb- ie those who coming from abroad minus those who are leaving -rrb- accounted for two-thirds of population growth in the year to summer 2004 .
emigration migration is not a one-way street .
as the world has become more mobile thanks to globalisation and cheaper travel , more people take the opportunity to move .
while the uk has been experiencing greater immigration , it has also experienced greater emigration .
this is not just people born in britain leaving .
the figures in this project show steep declines in some of the key historic migrant groups to britain , principally the irish and people born in the caribbean as many take the chance to retire back to their home countries .
no accurate figures exist for the number of britons who live abroad , how long they stay and how many return .
new european union states one of the new trends in migration has been arrival of workers from the european union 's new eastern states .
estimates suggest the uk is the favourite destination for workers from these states , largely because the british government has introduced liberal employment rules for new eu workers to plug what it says are labour shortages in a strong economy .
there are two conflicting figures in circulation , but both suggest the uk is the favourite destination .
whitehall thinks about 130,000 new eu workers have come to britain since enlargement in may 2004 .
a german study using different methodology suggests the figure for " new workers " - those who did n't already have ties to the uk - is nearer 50,000 .
illegal immigrants by definition , it 's impossible to count something you can not see - but do we know anything about illegal immigration ?
it 's unlikely that many if any unauthorised migrants - thought to be mostly people who overstay their visas and continue to work in the black economy - filled in the 2001 census form so the next best thing is guessing .
the census authorities did a degree of this themselves by trying to over-count the various groups they thought might not take part - the largest of these being single british men .
beyond the census , a row during the general election on illegal migration figures showed how difficult it is to estimate , with the top academics in the country saying their best guesses are based on inspiration more than anything else .
the official guess put forward by the home office is that there are between 310,000 and 570,000 people living in britain who are n't authorised to do so , although we have no means of working out if that 's accurate .
work visas the british work permit and visa system has been notoriously complicated for years - something which does not help people understand how migration works in practice .
now , the home office is in the middle of scrapping it and over five years replacing it with what ministers pledge will be a more transparent system of tiered-entitlement based on skills .
in short , those with the least skills will have little right to settle , but will still be able to work if there is demand for their labour .
those with the most skills to offer will have greater chance to stay .
how this will work in practice remains to be seen .

mr snow forecast that as much as 0.5 % may be knocked off the us 's annual gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the us , the world 's largest economy , had been expected to grow by close to 3.5 % this year .
however , that was before katrina blew ashore , killing thousands and causing damages of close to $ 100bn -lrb- £ 55bn -rrb- .
oil production facilities in the gulf of mexico were hit hard and the subsequent surge in crude and petrol prices are likely to brake us growth , mr snow said .
" it would seem to make sense to think that we could see a loss of gdp growth rate in the quarters ahead of a half a percent or so , " mr snow said late on tuesday .
see-saw effect the concern is that consumers will spend less in shops as they have to pay more for fuel and heating , while companies will either have to pass on their higher costs or let them eat into their profits , analysts said .
mr snow 's comments were echoing an earlier report from the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
according to the economic think-tank , high world oil prices are here to stay and the price shocks pose a threat to key economies such as the us , uk and germany .
growth in the us might " somewhat more subdued " in the second half of 2005 , the oecd said .
despite the concerns , the us is well placed for growth and any slowdown should be short-lived .
mr snow said that he expected growth to pick up again in 2006 , adding that the reconstruction and repair effort following katrina would prove to be a powerful economic stimulus .
gdp growth in 2006 should get a boost of 0.5 % from rebuilding , mr snow estimated .

mr snow forecast that as much as 0.5 % may be knocked off the us 's annual gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the us , the world 's largest economy , had been expected to grow by close to 3.5 % this year .
however , that was before katrina blew ashore , killing thousands and causing damages of close to $ 100bn -lrb- £ 55bn -rrb- .
oil production facilities in the gulf of mexico were hit hard and the subsequent surge in crude and petrol prices are likely to brake us growth , mr snow said .
" it would seem to make sense to think that we could see a loss of gdp growth rate in the quarters ahead of a half a percent or so , " mr snow said late on tuesday .
see-saw effect the concern is that consumers will spend less in shops as they have to pay more for fuel and heating , while companies will either have to pass on their higher costs or let them eat into their profits , analysts said .
mr snow 's comments were echoing an earlier report from the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- .
according to the economic think-tank , high world oil prices are here to stay and the price shocks pose a threat to key economies such as the us , uk and germany .
growth in the us might " somewhat more subdued " in the second half of 2005 , the oecd said .
despite the concerns , the us is well placed for growth and any slowdown should be short-lived .

but what does the research tell us about how we achieve a cohesive society ?
old assumptions about immigration to the uk no longer hold .
in recent years , and for the first time since records began in the 1970s , immigrants from outside the commonwealth and europe have made up the largest group of new arrivals .
while immigration to britain in the past has been overwhelmingly the story of just a small number of nations , recent immigrants have also come from a much wider range of countries .
so , the numbers of people born in places such as the former yugoslavia , sierra leone and south america have increased sharply , while the numbers of people born in the caribbean or ireland -lrb- traditionally , key immigrant groups -rrb- have actually fallen .
such diverse patterns are hard to capture through frequently-used categories for describing ethnic groups such as ' white ' , ' black ' and ' asian ' - and almost certainly this largely unrecorded and growing diversity has played a part in public concerns .
economic performance for instance , our research shows considerable variation in the socio-economic characteristics of immigrants by country of birth .
growing diversity strikes at the heart of the debate about how to balance two apparently opposing demands , between recognising difference and establishing a common identity this variation means that policymakers can not afford to treat all ' black ' groups as homogenous .
somali and nigerian immigrants to the uk have radically different socio-economic profiles , with the former generally doing worse than the latter .
but even within the same country of origin group , newer arrivals may be performing very differently from settled members .
while recently-arrived filipinos and australians are more likely to be in employment than settled immigrants from these countries , the opposite is true for iranians and iraqis .
similarly , while it was once assumed that ' white ' immigrants would have no trouble settling into british society , growing numbers of immigrants from central europe and south america , though they may often be classified as ' white ' , may require assistance to integrate .
what our research suggests is that integration policies need to be more nuanced and go beyond old assumptions and categories .
policymakers need to pay attention to how particular communities -lrb- or particular segments within communities -rrb- are doing .
greater diversity also raises important questions about representation ; about who gets to speak for whom ?
discussions following the july london bombings highlight the difficulty in identifying leaders who can legitimately speak for a community as diverse as british muslims .
the integration challenge how british policymakers respond to this growing diversity will be critical to the pursuit of racial equality and social cohesion .
it may also hold important lessons for other diverse societies around the world which are experiencing the same global forces of migration .
born abroad project maps immigration to britain where people come from where they live how well they do born abroad : full special report the british approach to diversity has come under attack in recent years .
events such as the london bombings suggest that the threat of extremism looms large .
some commentators suggest that years of celebrating difference have come at the cost of fostering unity .
on other hand , some ethnic minority groups still lag behind in many socio-economic indicators .
many live ' parallel lives ' in segregated areas with little integration with wider british societies .
this has led some commentators to suggest that multiculturalism 's approach to diversity is tokenistic .
growing diversity strikes at the heart of the debate about how to balance two apparently opposing demands , between recognising difference and establishing a common identity .
by highlighting the heterogeneity of new immigrants to the uk , our research suggests that it is time that integration policies go beyond the broad categories that they have traditionally relied on .
achieving greater racial equality will require policies that are attuned to fine-grained differences between and within communities .
there may also be lessons for building a healthier multicultural society .
by encouraging a plethora of immigrant and minority voices , it may be possible to build wider communities of interest that cut across traditional ethnic divides .
many in britain will be perturbed by this growing diversity .
but we hope this research generates a political debate in which general claims about immigrants -lrb- for example , that they are a drain on society , or that they all belong to ethnic minorities -rrb- give way to a more nuanced discussion .
we believe that the challenges brought by new immigration are neither unique nor insurmountable .
rising and more complex patterns of international mobility mean other countries are also experiencing growing diversity .
given its long and relatively good history of dealing with diversity , britain may actually be well-placed to deal to lead the way .
sarah kyambi is the author of the ippr 's new immigrant communities study , the basis for the bbc 's born abroad project which maps migration change in britain .
dhananjayan sriskandarajah is head of the ippr 's migration , equalities & citizenship team .

but what does the research tell us about how we achieve a cohesive society ?
old assumptions about immigration to the uk no longer hold .
in recent years , and for the first time since records began in the 1970s , immigrants from outside the commonwealth and europe have made up the largest group of new arrivals .
while immigration to britain in the past has been overwhelmingly the story of just a small number of nations , recent immigrants have also come from a much wider range of countries .
so , the numbers of people born in places such as the former yugoslavia , sierra leone and south america have increased sharply , while the numbers of people born in the caribbean or ireland -lrb- traditionally , key immigrant groups -rrb- have actually fallen .
such diverse patterns are hard to capture through frequently-used categories for describing ethnic groups such as ' white ' , ' black ' and ' asian ' - and almost certainly this largely unrecorded and growing diversity has played a part in public concerns .
economic performance for instance , our research shows considerable variation in the socio-economic characteristics of immigrants by country of birth .
growing diversity strikes at the heart of the debate about how to balance two apparently opposing demands , between recognising difference and establishing a common identity this variation means that policymakers can not afford to treat all ' black ' groups as homogenous .
somali and nigerian immigrants to the uk have radically different socio-economic profiles , with the former generally doing worse than the latter .
but even within the same country of origin group , newer arrivals may be performing very differently from settled members .
while recently-arrived filipinos and australians are more likely to be in employment than settled immigrants from these countries , the opposite is true for iranians and iraqis .
similarly , while it was once assumed that ' white ' immigrants would have no trouble settling into british society , growing numbers of immigrants from central europe and south america , though they may often be classified as ' white ' , may require assistance to integrate .
what our research suggests is that integration policies need to be more nuanced and go beyond old assumptions and categories .
policymakers need to pay attention to how particular communities -lrb- or particular segments within communities -rrb- are doing .
greater diversity also raises important questions about representation ; about who gets to speak for whom ?
discussions following the july london bombings highlight the difficulty in identifying leaders who can legitimately speak for a community as diverse as british muslims .
the integration challenge how british policymakers respond to this growing diversity will be critical to the pursuit of racial equality and social cohesion .
it may also hold important lessons for other diverse societies around the world which are experiencing the same global forces of migration .
born abroad project maps immigration to britain where people come from where they live how well they do born abroad : full special report the british approach to diversity has come under attack in recent years .
events such as the london bombings suggest that the threat of extremism looms large .
some commentators suggest that years of celebrating difference have come at the cost of fostering unity .
on other hand , some ethnic minority groups still lag behind in many socio-economic indicators .
many live ' parallel lives ' in segregated areas with little integration with wider british societies .
this has led some commentators to suggest that multiculturalism 's approach to diversity is tokenistic .
growing diversity strikes at the heart of the debate about how to balance two apparently opposing demands , between recognising difference and establishing a common identity .
by highlighting the heterogeneity of new immigrants to the uk , our research suggests that it is time that integration policies go beyond the broad categories that they have traditionally relied on .
achieving greater racial equality will require policies that are attuned to fine-grained differences between and within communities .
there may also be lessons for building a healthier multicultural society .
by encouraging a plethora of immigrant and minority voices , it may be possible to build wider communities of interest that cut across traditional ethnic divides .
many in britain will be perturbed by this growing diversity .
but we hope this research generates a political debate in which general claims about immigrants -lrb- for example , that they are a drain on society , or that they all belong to ethnic minorities -rrb- give way to a more nuanced discussion .
we believe that the challenges brought by new immigration are neither unique nor insurmountable .
rising and more complex patterns of international mobility mean other countries are also experiencing growing diversity .
given its long and relatively good history of dealing with diversity , britain may actually be well-placed to deal to lead the way .
sarah kyambi is the author of the ippr 's new immigrant communities study , the basis for the bbc 's born abroad project which maps migration change in britain .
dhananjayan sriskandarajah is head of the ippr 's migration , equalities & citizenship team .

for the past few years there has been a growing political and public clamour over migration which reached a height at the 2005 general election .
but throughout all of this time , there has been a great deal of dispute about what has actually been happening in britain - and whether or not it is something to really worry about .
with the publication of the bbc 's born abroad project , we can try to answer far more of these difficult questions than ever before - although we make no claims that we are revealing all the answers .
born abroad is drawn on data processed by an expert team at sheffield university for the institute for public policy research , a think tank .
the bbc news website has taken all of this data and turned it into a website for the public to see what was happening locally in their area at the time of the 2001 census .
naturally the world moves on and there have been significant changes since then .
asylum numbers have rapidly changed -lrb- up and then down again -rrb- , new workers from eastern europe are arriving thanks to eu enlargement , there are controversies over illegal immigrants and also moves by government to restructure economic migration from top to bottom .
but putting these issues aside , the data reveals some important points about what makes up modern britain .
new immigration of the total foreign-born population of britain - some 4.3m people - recent immigrants today make up just over half of the total .
this shows beyond a doubt that the uk is one of the principal industrialised nations in a complex picture of international economic movements .
asylum : migration debate has focused on a few key issues with new immigrants tending to be younger and from a more diverse background , the figures show how migration has increasingly been on economic grounds alone .
this marks a change from past decades when migration tended to be on family grounds - the arrival of a spouse , for instance .
immigration is overwhelmingly the story of london 's development - four out of 10 people born abroad have their home in the capital .
they make up about a quarter of london 's population : an almost uncountable range of peoples has arrived in the capital over the years , making up a remarkably broad patchwork of nationalities , ethnicities , languages , communities and identities .
all of this cements london 's international reputation as a leading " world city " - a place that seems to become home to anyone from anywhere .

for the past few years there has been a growing political and public clamour over migration which reached a height at the 2005 general election .
but throughout all of this time , there has been a great deal of dispute about what has actually been happening in britain - and whether or not it is something to really worry about .
with the publication of the bbc 's born abroad project , we can try to answer far more of these difficult questions than ever before - although we make no claims that we are revealing all the answers .
born abroad is drawn on data processed by an expert team at sheffield university for the institute for public policy research , a think tank .
the bbc news website has taken all of this data and turned it into a website for the public to see what was happening locally in their area at the time of the 2001 census .
naturally the world moves on and there have been significant changes since then .
asylum numbers have rapidly changed -lrb- up and then down again -rrb- , new workers from eastern europe are arriving thanks to eu enlargement , there are controversies over illegal immigrants and also moves by government to restructure economic migration from top to bottom .
but putting these issues aside , the data reveals some important points about what makes up modern britain .
new immigration of the total foreign-born population of britain - some 4.3m people - recent immigrants today make up just over half of the total .
this shows beyond a doubt that the uk is one of the principal industrialised nations in a complex picture of international economic movements .
asylum : migration debate has focused on a few key issues with new immigrants tending to be younger and from a more diverse background , the figures show how migration has increasingly been on economic grounds alone .
this marks a change from past decades when migration tended to be on family grounds - the arrival of a spouse , for instance .
immigration is overwhelmingly the story of london 's development - four out of 10 people born abroad have their home in the capital .
they make up about a quarter of london 's population : an almost uncountable range of peoples has arrived in the capital over the years , making up a remarkably broad patchwork of nationalities , ethnicities , languages , communities and identities .
all of this cements london 's international reputation as a leading " world city " - a place that seems to become home to anyone from anywhere .
but while immigration is predominantly a london story , migration is now affecting almost every area of the country in ways that have not been seen before .
take the north east for example .
it has the lowest number of people born abroad living there - but has experienced the second fastest rate of change .
taken together with north-west england , the two regions would have experienced significant population declines without the current rate of immigration .
it is this rate of change , some of it quite sudden in some areas , that raises important questions about how britain as a nation has been able to handle this change .

a large group of british business leaders has accompanied mr blair on his visit to india .
britain and europe are keen to play a part in india 's economic expansion which is predicted to be a strong 7 % this year .
mr blair flew to delhi from china , where he discussed trade and raised issues of human rights and democracy .
ahead of the talks , mr blair and his wife cherie laid a wreath at the memorial to indian independence leader mahatma gandhi .
" the principles in which he lived his life will endure forever ; namely that the ultimate salvation for humanity comes when people of all colours , race , nations and religions learn to live in peace and harmony with each other , " he wrote in the visitors ' book .
there is heavy security for mr blair 's visit .
the roads outside his hotel and the summit venue have been sealed and armed police officers deployed .
mutual benefits the talks come as latest figures show indian exports to the eu growing by 20 % a year , with imports rising 15 % .
the eu buys 25 % of indian exports , although it still has a small trade surplus with india .
india is increasingly looked upon by the eu as an equal partner , says the bbc 's nick bryant in delhi .
where once indian leaders sought a helping hand , now the focus is on how closer economic cooperation can deliver mutual benefits .
mr blair is meeting indian prime minister manmohan singh on wednesday in his role as current president of the eu , and again on thursday for separate bilateral india-britain talks .
britain is the third-largest investor in india , and the two countries do about $ 10bn -lrb- £ 5.5bn -rrb- worth of business a year .
mr singh is expected to press mr blair over subsidies paid to european farmers , which it is felt prevent indian farm exporters gaining access to european markets .
meanwhile the british leader is likely to raise the issue of global warming , and what developing countries like india can do to help tackle it .

mr blair is meeting indian prime minister manmohan singh on wednesday in his role as current president of the eu , and again on thursday for separate bilateral india-britain talks .
britain is the third-largest investor in india , and the two countries do about $ 10bn -lrb- £ 5.5bn -rrb- worth of business a year .
mr singh is expected to press mr blair over subsidies paid to european farmers , which it is felt prevent indian farm exporters gaining access to european markets .
meanwhile the british leader is likely to raise the issue of global warming , and what developing countries like india can do to help tackle it .

the bbc 's born abroad research shows 77,312 people who were born outside the british isles live in wales .
this represents 2.66 % of all residents , which is lower than any other british nation or region and compares to 7.5 % for the uk as a whole .
born abroad is an in-depth study of people born outside the british isles , and where they now live .
the figures have been collated and calculated from the 2001 census by sheffield university and published by the institute of public policy research .
they show that the number of people born abroad who live in wales has risen by 23.9 % between 1991 and 2001 , which represents a 0.46 % rise in terms of the overall population .
top 10 places of birth outside british isles of people living in wales germany india pakistan italy south africa bangladesh hong kong usa other far east australia this is the slowest rate of change compared with other parts of britain , and compares with 6.35 % in london , where 24.81 % of the population are immigrants .
the largest clusters of immigrants are in the cardiff area , while the south wales valleys have some of the lowest numbers .
in cardiff 's cathays area , 13.03 % of the population were immigrants in 2001 , while there were 8.88 % in penarth and 7.51 % in radyr , also in cardiff .
this compares to 0.8 % in rhondda north , 0.83 % in rhondda south and 0.94 % in ebbw vale .
between 1991 and 2001 , there have been decreases in the number of people born abroad in 11 areas , including cardiff south , meirionydd urban , caernarfon rural , preseli rural and south pembrokeshire .
more than 15,000 of people born abroad came from germany and india - the high number of german immigrants is partly due to children of soldiers stationed at british military bases in germany .
meanwhile , the number of italians in wales has fallen by 36 over the 10-year period .
the british isles includes england , scotland , wales , northern ireland and the republic of ireland .

the artwork shows rowling in a room with distorted perspective sitting at a table and eating a boiled egg and toast soldiers .

three boiled eggs on a plate symbolise the potter author 's three children .
mr pearson wright said : " i was drawn to jo principally because of my admiration for a woman who can successfully combine motherhood and a creative career .
" jo told me that she had been drawn to my work because of the tiny paintings that i had done of a family of people with red hair - she confessed to sharing a fascination for people with red hair , which any readers familiar with the weasley family in the harry potter books should not be surprised about .
