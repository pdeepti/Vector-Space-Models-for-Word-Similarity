the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .
they are not only hated at home in england but everywhere in the world among fair minded decent people . - charles reichert , canada it is sad and unfair of british newspapers to attack the new pope , benedict xvi .
i , as a catholic , am deeply distressed because of this . - maria stec , us and poland yes , i think that it was in typical british style that the pope was indeed libeled and slandered .
i think he deserves an apology in just as bold a print .
moreover , i think the british prime minister should stand up and denounce this sort of journalism . - john breaux yes , the british newspapers are not only unfair with their treatment of our new pope , but they are also displaying their normal behavior about anything non-british .
they will probably end up giving a left-handed apology by saying that they " were just joshing . "
their humor even stinks ! - terry cummings the british press was not at all unfair to examine the past of pope benedict .
one 's life is formed by one 's past experiences .
the fact that the new pope served time in the hitler youth as a teenager is significant .
this is not to say one should not be allowed to move beyond one 's past though .
you have to remember the new pope is a mere mortal .
a pope is not capable of granting salvation and can not , therefore , be expected to be perfect .
our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?
and just let him show us what a great successor of the great john paul ii he can be ? - ximena lara , mexico german newspapers should get angry at rupert murdoch and not the british people since he owns and closely rules the editorial stance of all .
even though he is supposed to be a catholic , he is a nasty one . - jj hubbard the sun and mirror headlines are not reflected in the actual coverage .
they give a balanced view of his theological stance as has , for example , the daily telegraph .
they also give a fair account of his position during the nazi period .
actually the headlines are " friendly jocular " in a typically british way .
another paper prefers to describe him as a german shepherd .
another has a cartoon of him shouting from his balcony ordering his swiss guards and staff to get into proper straight lines . - jack rice i think that when one considers what the mirror and sun had to say about the new pope , one must consider the source .
they are tabloid rags who live only to sensationalize to sell papers .
was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?
was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .
he even killed those who were loyal to him for being honest and speaking their minds .
i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .
we can not afford to throw stones and judge people by their past alone . - jennifer hurlock , us i think it is only expected that the secular media would demonize benedict xvi , a non-progressive pope .
traditionalists are no longer welcome in the mainstream media , even if they are the head of a traditional institution , such as the catholic church .
also , the media wants to sell papers . - matthew schoolfield , us it does not surprise me in the least that one of england 's leading news services would publish such sentiment , in light of what they as a small country went through during the war years .
nor do i find it distasteful , for the one single reason : virtually everyone who served in the hitler youth movement and the nazi war criminals who came to the us has denied or played down their roles during the war years , 1930s and leading into the 1940s and onward . - john whitefox , us i do n't like the derogatory language that some of the media -lrb- particularly from the us -rrb- is using to speak of the pope .
let 's give the man the benefit of the doubt .
i 'm sure he 'll end up doing an excellent job . - milena barrios , columbia i was happy to read your report regarding the nazi labels put on pope benedict xvi by the british media .
i live in canada and here we also had some of those comments on prime time tv news by the major broadcasters .
i was offended by the labels and am not german , but a catholic . - rvkulak , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " nazi " attacks on pope anger germans germany 's top-selling newspaper " bild " was furious on thursday at the coverage of the new pope by british newspapers , which had accentuated benedict xvi 's past as a teenager in nazi germany .

the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .
a mere three points separate munich from a 19th german championship after a 3-1 triumph over ten-man vfl bochum helped felix magath 's side power nine points clear at the summit .

dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .
relegation zone excitement bildunterschrift : freiburg 's keeper richard golz , top , fights for the ball , but his team will still be playing in the second division next season though the top of the table is already clear , there 's still a lot to be decided at the bottom .
it 's clear that freiburg , who have won a miserly three games all season , are on their way to the second division after at 3-1 defeat at arminia bielefeld .
but it 's still unclear which other two teams will join them .
last year 's second division team mainz 05 improved its chances at staying in the top flight with a win over hanover 96 .

the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .
they are not only hated at home in england but everywhere in the world among fair minded decent people . - charles reichert , canada it is sad and unfair of british newspapers to attack the new pope , benedict xvi .
i , as a catholic , am deeply distressed because of this . - maria stec , us and poland yes , i think that it was in typical british style that the pope was indeed libeled and slandered .
i think he deserves an apology in just as bold a print .

they will probably end up giving a left-handed apology by saying that they " were just joshing . "
their humor even stinks ! - terry cummings the british press was not at all unfair to examine the past of pope benedict .
one 's life is formed by one 's past experiences .
the fact that the new pope served time in the hitler youth as a teenager is significant .
this is not to say one should not be allowed to move beyond one 's past though .
you have to remember the new pope is a mere mortal .
a pope is not capable of granting salvation and can not , therefore , be expected to be perfect .
our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?

was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?
was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .
he even killed those who were loyal to him for being honest and speaking their minds .
i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .

and just let him show us what a great successor of the great john paul ii he can be ? - ximena lara , mexico german newspapers should get angry at rupert murdoch and not the british people since he owns and closely rules the editorial stance of all .
even though he is supposed to be a catholic , he is a nasty one . - jj hubbard the sun and mirror headlines are not reflected in the actual coverage .
they give a balanced view of his theological stance as has , for example , the daily telegraph .
they also give a fair account of his position during the nazi period .
actually the headlines are " friendly jocular " in a typically british way .
another paper prefers to describe him as a german shepherd .
another has a cartoon of him shouting from his balcony ordering his swiss guards and staff to get into proper straight lines . - jack rice i think that when one considers what the mirror and sun had to say about the new pope , one must consider the source .
they are tabloid rags who live only to sensationalize to sell papers .
was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?
was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .
he even killed those who were loyal to him for being honest and speaking their minds .
i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .
we can not afford to throw stones and judge people by their past alone . - jennifer hurlock , us i think it is only expected that the secular media would demonize benedict xvi , a non-progressive pope .
traditionalists are no longer welcome in the mainstream media , even if they are the head of a traditional institution , such as the catholic church .
also , the media wants to sell papers . - matthew schoolfield , us it does not surprise me in the least that one of england 's leading news services would publish such sentiment , in light of what they as a small country went through during the war years .
nor do i find it distasteful , for the one single reason : virtually everyone who served in the hitler youth movement and the nazi war criminals who came to the us has denied or played down their roles during the war years , 1930s and leading into the 1940s and onward . - john whitefox , us i do n't like the derogatory language that some of the media -lrb- particularly from the us -rrb- is using to speak of the pope .
let 's give the man the benefit of the doubt .
i 'm sure he 'll end up doing an excellent job . - milena barrios , columbia i was happy to read your report regarding the nazi labels put on pope benedict xvi by the british media .
i live in canada and here we also had some of those comments on prime time tv news by the major broadcasters .
i was offended by the labels and am not german , but a catholic . - rvkulak , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " nazi " attacks on pope anger germans germany 's top-selling newspaper " bild " was furious on thursday at the coverage of the new pope by british newspapers , which had accentuated benedict xvi 's past as a teenager in nazi germany .

but those helping pilgrims find accommodation during their visit said they still had to turn people down . " i keep telling them : ' every place we know of is booked , " ' antonio tedesco of the german pilgrims ' center , told german public broadcaster br .
" and still people decide to come even though they do n't know where they will stay .

the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .

munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .
relegation zone excitement bildunterschrift : freiburg 's keeper richard golz , top , fights for the ball , but his team will still be playing in the second division next season though the top of the table is already clear , there 's still a lot to be decided at the bottom .
it 's clear that freiburg , who have won a miserly three games all season , are on their way to the second division after at 3-1 defeat at arminia bielefeld .
but it 's still unclear which other two teams will join them .
last year 's second division team mainz 05 improved its chances at staying in the top flight with a win over hanover 96 .

few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .
a mere three points separate munich from a 19th german championship after a 3-1 triumph over ten-man vfl bochum helped felix magath 's side power nine points clear at the summit .
munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .
relegation zone excitement bildunterschrift : freiburg 's keeper richard golz , top , fights for the ball , but his team will still be playing in the second division next season though the top of the table is already clear , there 's still a lot to be decided at the bottom .
it 's clear that freiburg , who have won a miserly three games all season , are on their way to the second division after at 3-1 defeat at arminia bielefeld .
but it 's still unclear which other two teams will join them .
last year 's second division team mainz 05 improved its chances at staying in the top flight with a win over hanover 96 .
sv hamburg moved level on points with fifth place bremen courtesy of a 3-0 victory over local rivals hansa rostock , putting rostock 's chances at bundesliga action next season at risk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.04.2005 schalke suffers while bayern blooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalie frank rost watches his championship dreams fade the opening coin toss was about the only thing schalke won in its 4-1 loss to hertha berlin saturday , brining schalke 's chance at grabbing the german title from bayern munich to a screeching halt . hertha berlin trainer falko götz 's players proved his pre-match prophecy about a decisive win over second place schalke 04 true with a 4-1 victory .
the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .
a mere three points separate munich from a 19th german championship after a 3-1 triumph over ten-man vfl bochum helped felix magath 's side power nine points clear at the summit .
munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .
relegation zone excitement bildunterschrift : freiburg 's keeper richard golz , top , fights for the ball , but his team will still be playing in the second division next season though the top of the table is already clear , there 's still a lot to be decided at the bottom .
it 's clear that freiburg , who have won a miserly three games all season , are on their way to the second division after at 3-1 defeat at arminia bielefeld .
but it 's still unclear which other two teams will join them .
last year 's second division team mainz 05 improved its chances at staying in the top flight with a win over hanover 96 .

the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .
a mere three points separate munich from a 19th german championship after a 3-1 triumph over ten-man vfl bochum helped felix magath 's side power nine points clear at the summit .
munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .
relegation zone excitement bildunterschrift : freiburg 's keeper richard golz , top , fights for the ball , but his team will still be playing in the second division next season though the top of the table is already clear , there 's still a lot to be decided at the bottom .
it 's clear that freiburg , who have won a miserly three games all season , are on their way to the second division after at 3-1 defeat at arminia bielefeld .
but it 's still unclear which other two teams will join them .
last year 's second division team mainz 05 improved its chances at staying in the top flight with a win over hanover 96 .
sv hamburg moved level on points with fifth place bremen courtesy of a 3-0 victory over local rivals hansa rostock , putting rostock 's chances at bundesliga action next season at risk .

in fact , it 's going into fewer glasses these days .
germans are drinking less of the sudsy stuff and brewers are getting alarmed . for foreigners , the old stereotype about a german social event has a bunch of rather portly germans in lederhosen sitting in a beer garden listening to oompah music , each with a stein full of frothy beer in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , chairman of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- well , few people drink out of the steins anymore - except for tourists , and the occasional politician -lrb- photo -rrb- , at oktoberfest - and more frequently these days where germans are relaxing , you 're almost as likely to see a glass of wine or a cocktail sitting in front of them instead of a beer . that 's the case at fluido , one of berlin 's hip bars in the trendy prenzlauer berg neighborhood , where there are a few glasses of red wine scattered about and a lot of brightly colored cocktails . " i think beer is just so boring and there 's such a variety when it comes to cocktails , " said sousa , a bartender .
" beer always tastes the same .
to quench your thirst in the beer garden in the summer , it 's nice enough .

beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .
in fact , between 1994 and 2003 , consumption shrank by more than 13 percent , according to brewers .
the trend does n't look like it 's going to turn around dramatically anytime soon , although the fall has levelled off somewhat over the past year . mineral water now beats beer on the popularity scale , part of which can be attributed to a new health consciousness among germans , especially younger ones .

the oetker group , one of germany 's biggest beer producers , announced it was closing it berliner kindl brewery in berlin , after 133 years . the brinkhoff brewery in the western germany city of dortmund faces the same fate .
according to stefan lepin of the raderberger group , a subsidiary of the oetker group , with almost 1,300 breweries , germany 's beer market is simply tapped out .
he said the unwelcome news about brewery closings will likely become more common in the future . " we have an estimated 30 to 40 percent overcapacity , " he said .
" consumption will drop again in the future and we think the consolidation of the market will go ahead . " while many people were upset at the closing of a traditional berlin brewery , not to mention at the loss of jobs , some of the younger in-crowd at fluido seem less concerned .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2005 germany 's love affair with beer cools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a bit less of this going on these days contrary to popular cliche , beer in germany does n't come out of the kitchen faucet .
in fact , it 's going into fewer glasses these days .
germans are drinking less of the sudsy stuff and brewers are getting alarmed . for foreigners , the old stereotype about a german social event has a bunch of rather portly germans in lederhosen sitting in a beer garden listening to oompah music , each with a stein full of frothy beer in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , chairman of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- well , few people drink out of the steins anymore - except for tourists , and the occasional politician -lrb- photo -rrb- , at oktoberfest - and more frequently these days where germans are relaxing , you 're almost as likely to see a glass of wine or a cocktail sitting in front of them instead of a beer . that 's the case at fluido , one of berlin 's hip bars in the trendy prenzlauer berg neighborhood , where there are a few glasses of red wine scattered about and a lot of brightly colored cocktails . " i think beer is just so boring and there 's such a variety when it comes to cocktails , " said sousa , a bartender .
" beer always tastes the same .
to quench your thirst in the beer garden in the summer , it 's nice enough .
but for all the time , i do n't know . " uncool those are words that keep the beer industry up at night .
beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .
in fact , between 1994 and 2003 , consumption shrank by more than 13 percent , according to brewers .
the trend does n't look like it 's going to turn around dramatically anytime soon , although the fall has levelled off somewhat over the past year . mineral water now beats beer on the popularity scale , part of which can be attributed to a new health consciousness among germans , especially younger ones .

" beer is n't considered cool anymore , " said andreas , who had just ordered a mojito cocktail at fluido .
" people just do n't want to be compared with daddy , who at 50 is carrying around a big beer belly with him . " it 's not that beer companies are n't trying to change a fusty image they feel is unfair .
beer companies are looking for a facelift , putting their products in new bottles with new names , eye-catching labels and new advertising strategies . " beer in itself is not fattening , " insisted birte kleppien , spokeswoman of the german brewers ' association .

2005 the result has been a rash of brewery closings .
the oetker group , one of germany 's biggest beer producers , announced it was closing it berliner kindl brewery in berlin , after 133 years . the brinkhoff brewery in the western germany city of dortmund faces the same fate .
according to stefan lepin of the raderberger group , a subsidiary of the oetker group , with almost 1,300 breweries , germany 's beer market is simply tapped out .
he said the unwelcome news about brewery closings will likely become more common in the future . " we have an estimated 30 to 40 percent overcapacity , " he said .
" consumption will drop again in the future and we think the consolidation of the market will go ahead . " while many people were upset at the closing of a traditional berlin brewery , not to mention at the loss of jobs , some of the younger in-crowd at fluido seem less concerned .
they are enjoying the broader palette of drink options available these days in germany .
but it was n't always that way . " maybe the germans have simply become a little more cultivated when it comes to drinking , " said michaela , who was having a cosmopolitan with her boyfriend at the bar .
" people put more value on drinking a nice wine or a cocktail , because now we can .

the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .
they are not only hated at home in england but everywhere in the world among fair minded decent people . - charles reichert , canada it is sad and unfair of british newspapers to attack the new pope , benedict xvi .
i , as a catholic , am deeply distressed because of this . - maria stec , us and poland yes , i think that it was in typical british style that the pope was indeed libeled and slandered .
i think he deserves an apology in just as bold a print .
moreover , i think the british prime minister should stand up and denounce this sort of journalism . - john breaux yes , the british newspapers are not only unfair with their treatment of our new pope , but they are also displaying their normal behavior about anything non-british .
they will probably end up giving a left-handed apology by saying that they " were just joshing . "
their humor even stinks ! - terry cummings the british press was not at all unfair to examine the past of pope benedict .
one 's life is formed by one 's past experiences .
the fact that the new pope served time in the hitler youth as a teenager is significant .
this is not to say one should not be allowed to move beyond one 's past though .
you have to remember the new pope is a mere mortal .
a pope is not capable of granting salvation and can not , therefore , be expected to be perfect .
our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?
and just let him show us what a great successor of the great john paul ii he can be ? - ximena lara , mexico german newspapers should get angry at rupert murdoch and not the british people since he owns and closely rules the editorial stance of all .
even though he is supposed to be a catholic , he is a nasty one . - jj hubbard the sun and mirror headlines are not reflected in the actual coverage .
they give a balanced view of his theological stance as has , for example , the daily telegraph .
they also give a fair account of his position during the nazi period .
actually the headlines are " friendly jocular " in a typically british way .
another paper prefers to describe him as a german shepherd .
another has a cartoon of him shouting from his balcony ordering his swiss guards and staff to get into proper straight lines . - jack rice i think that when one considers what the mirror and sun had to say about the new pope , one must consider the source .
they are tabloid rags who live only to sensationalize to sell papers .
was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?
was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .
he even killed those who were loyal to him for being honest and speaking their minds .
i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .
we can not afford to throw stones and judge people by their past alone . - jennifer hurlock , us i think it is only expected that the secular media would demonize benedict xvi , a non-progressive pope .
traditionalists are no longer welcome in the mainstream media , even if they are the head of a traditional institution , such as the catholic church .
also , the media wants to sell papers . - matthew schoolfield , us it does not surprise me in the least that one of england 's leading news services would publish such sentiment , in light of what they as a small country went through during the war years .
nor do i find it distasteful , for the one single reason : virtually everyone who served in the hitler youth movement and the nazi war criminals who came to the us has denied or played down their roles during the war years , 1930s and leading into the 1940s and onward . - john whitefox , us i do n't like the derogatory language that some of the media -lrb- particularly from the us -rrb- is using to speak of the pope .
let 's give the man the benefit of the doubt .
i 'm sure he 'll end up doing an excellent job . - milena barrios , columbia i was happy to read your report regarding the nazi labels put on pope benedict xvi by the british media .
i live in canada and here we also had some of those comments on prime time tv news by the major broadcasters .

the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .
they are not only hated at home in england but everywhere in the world among fair minded decent people . - charles reichert , canada it is sad and unfair of british newspapers to attack the new pope , benedict xvi .
i , as a catholic , am deeply distressed because of this . - maria stec , us and poland yes , i think that it was in typical british style that the pope was indeed libeled and slandered .
i think he deserves an apology in just as bold a print .
moreover , i think the british prime minister should stand up and denounce this sort of journalism . - john breaux yes , the british newspapers are not only unfair with their treatment of our new pope , but they are also displaying their normal behavior about anything non-british .
they will probably end up giving a left-handed apology by saying that they " were just joshing . "
their humor even stinks ! - terry cummings the british press was not at all unfair to examine the past of pope benedict .
one 's life is formed by one 's past experiences .
the fact that the new pope served time in the hitler youth as a teenager is significant .
this is not to say one should not be allowed to move beyond one 's past though .
you have to remember the new pope is a mere mortal .
a pope is not capable of granting salvation and can not , therefore , be expected to be perfect .
our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?
and just let him show us what a great successor of the great john paul ii he can be ? - ximena lara , mexico german newspapers should get angry at rupert murdoch and not the british people since he owns and closely rules the editorial stance of all .
even though he is supposed to be a catholic , he is a nasty one . - jj hubbard the sun and mirror headlines are not reflected in the actual coverage .
they give a balanced view of his theological stance as has , for example , the daily telegraph .
they also give a fair account of his position during the nazi period .
actually the headlines are " friendly jocular " in a typically british way .
another paper prefers to describe him as a german shepherd .
another has a cartoon of him shouting from his balcony ordering his swiss guards and staff to get into proper straight lines . - jack rice i think that when one considers what the mirror and sun had to say about the new pope , one must consider the source .
they are tabloid rags who live only to sensationalize to sell papers .
was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?
was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .

anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .
he even killed those who were loyal to him for being honest and speaking their minds .
i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .
we can not afford to throw stones and judge people by their past alone . - jennifer hurlock , us i think it is only expected that the secular media would demonize benedict xvi , a non-progressive pope .
traditionalists are no longer welcome in the mainstream media , even if they are the head of a traditional institution , such as the catholic church .
also , the media wants to sell papers . - matthew schoolfield , us it does not surprise me in the least that one of england 's leading news services would publish such sentiment , in light of what they as a small country went through during the war years .
nor do i find it distasteful , for the one single reason : virtually everyone who served in the hitler youth movement and the nazi war criminals who came to the us has denied or played down their roles during the war years , 1930s and leading into the 1940s and onward . - john whitefox , us i do n't like the derogatory language that some of the media -lrb- particularly from the us -rrb- is using to speak of the pope .
let 's give the man the benefit of the doubt .
i 'm sure he 'll end up doing an excellent job . - milena barrios , columbia i was happy to read your report regarding the nazi labels put on pope benedict xvi by the british media .
i live in canada and here we also had some of those comments on prime time tv news by the major broadcasters .
i was offended by the labels and am not german , but a catholic . - rvkulak , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " nazi " attacks on pope anger germans germany 's top-selling newspaper " bild " was furious on thursday at the coverage of the new pope by british newspapers , which had accentuated benedict xvi 's past as a teenager in nazi germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.04.2005 schalke suffers while bayern blooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalie frank rost watches his championship dreams fade the opening coin toss was about the only thing schalke won in its 4-1 loss to hertha berlin saturday , brining schalke 's chance at grabbing the german title from bayern munich to a screeching halt . hertha berlin trainer falko götz 's players proved his pre-match prophecy about a decisive win over second place schalke 04 true with a 4-1 victory .
the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .
a mere three points separate munich from a 19th german championship after a 3-1 triumph over ten-man vfl bochum helped felix magath 's side power nine points clear at the summit .
munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .
relegation zone excitement bildunterschrift : freiburg 's keeper richard golz , top , fights for the ball , but his team will still be playing in the second division next season though the top of the table is already clear , there 's still a lot to be decided at the bottom .
it 's clear that freiburg , who have won a miserly three games all season , are on their way to the second division after at 3-1 defeat at arminia bielefeld .
but it 's still unclear which other two teams will join them .
last year 's second division team mainz 05 improved its chances at staying in the top flight with a win over hanover 96 .

the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .

munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .
" once you 've drunk a beer in germany , you can develop a certain love for it , " the chinese student said .

in fact , it 's going into fewer glasses these days .
germans are drinking less of the sudsy stuff and brewers are getting alarmed . for foreigners , the old stereotype about a german social event has a bunch of rather portly germans in lederhosen sitting in a beer garden listening to oompah music , each with a stein full of frothy beer in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , chairman of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- well , few people drink out of the steins anymore - except for tourists , and the occasional politician -lrb- photo -rrb- , at oktoberfest - and more frequently these days where germans are relaxing , you 're almost as likely to see a glass of wine or a cocktail sitting in front of them instead of a beer . that 's the case at fluido , one of berlin 's hip bars in the trendy prenzlauer berg neighborhood , where there are a few glasses of red wine scattered about and a lot of brightly colored cocktails . " i think beer is just so boring and there 's such a variety when it comes to cocktails , " said sousa , a bartender .
" beer always tastes the same .
to quench your thirst in the beer garden in the summer , it 's nice enough .
but for all the time , i do n't know . " uncool those are words that keep the beer industry up at night .
beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .
in fact , between 1994 and 2003 , consumption shrank by more than 13 percent , according to brewers .
the trend does n't look like it 's going to turn around dramatically anytime soon , although the fall has levelled off somewhat over the past year . mineral water now beats beer on the popularity scale , part of which can be attributed to a new health consciousness among germans , especially younger ones .
they appear to prefer throwing back gatorade at the gym instead of guzzling pints at the corner bar .
slim and trim is in , a beer gut is not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a new concept munich beer garden owners try to reach younger people .

" beer is n't considered cool anymore , " said andreas , who had just ordered a mojito cocktail at fluido .
" people just do n't want to be compared with daddy , who at 50 is carrying around a big beer belly with him . " it 's not that beer companies are n't trying to change a fusty image they feel is unfair .
beer companies are looking for a facelift , putting their products in new bottles with new names , eye-catching labels and new advertising strategies . " beer in itself is not fattening , " insisted birte kleppien , spokeswoman of the german brewers ' association .
" it depends on what you eat with it . " according to her , demographic shifts in germany are hurting beer 's fortunes here .
the group of beer drinkers that her industry has its eye on , those between 35 and 45 , is shrinking .

the oetker group , one of germany 's biggest beer producers , announced it was closing it berliner kindl brewery in berlin , after 133 years . the brinkhoff brewery in the western germany city of dortmund faces the same fate .
according to stefan lepin of the raderberger group , a subsidiary of the oetker group , with almost 1,300 breweries , germany 's beer market is simply tapped out .
he said the unwelcome news about brewery closings will likely become more common in the future . " we have an estimated 30 to 40 percent overcapacity , " he said .
" consumption will drop again in the future and we think the consolidation of the market will go ahead . " while many people were upset at the closing of a traditional berlin brewery , not to mention at the loss of jobs , some of the younger in-crowd at fluido seem less concerned .

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .
" once you 've drunk a beer in germany , you can develop a certain love for it , " the chinese student said .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2005 germany 's love affair with beer cools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a bit less of this going on these days contrary to popular cliche , beer in germany does n't come out of the kitchen faucet .
in fact , it 's going into fewer glasses these days .
germans are drinking less of the sudsy stuff and brewers are getting alarmed . for foreigners , the old stereotype about a german social event has a bunch of rather portly germans in lederhosen sitting in a beer garden listening to oompah music , each with a stein full of frothy beer in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , chairman of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- well , few people drink out of the steins anymore - except for tourists , and the occasional politician -lrb- photo -rrb- , at oktoberfest - and more frequently these days where germans are relaxing , you 're almost as likely to see a glass of wine or a cocktail sitting in front of them instead of a beer . that 's the case at fluido , one of berlin 's hip bars in the trendy prenzlauer berg neighborhood , where there are a few glasses of red wine scattered about and a lot of brightly colored cocktails . " i think beer is just so boring and there 's such a variety when it comes to cocktails , " said sousa , a bartender .
" beer always tastes the same .
to quench your thirst in the beer garden in the summer , it 's nice enough .
but for all the time , i do n't know . " uncool those are words that keep the beer industry up at night .
beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .
in fact , between 1994 and 2003 , consumption shrank by more than 13 percent , according to brewers .
the trend does n't look like it 's going to turn around dramatically anytime soon , although the fall has levelled off somewhat over the past year . mineral water now beats beer on the popularity scale , part of which can be attributed to a new health consciousness among germans , especially younger ones .
they appear to prefer throwing back gatorade at the gym instead of guzzling pints at the corner bar .
slim and trim is in , a beer gut is not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a new concept munich beer garden owners try to reach younger people .
our picture shows a young couple drinking a caipirinha-cocktail out of a 1-litre jug .
" beer is n't considered cool anymore , " said andreas , who had just ordered a mojito cocktail at fluido .
" people just do n't want to be compared with daddy , who at 50 is carrying around a big beer belly with him . " it 's not that beer companies are n't trying to change a fusty image they feel is unfair .
beer companies are looking for a facelift , putting their products in new bottles with new names , eye-catching labels and new advertising strategies . " beer in itself is not fattening , " insisted birte kleppien , spokeswoman of the german brewers ' association .
" it depends on what you eat with it . " according to her , demographic shifts in germany are hurting beer 's fortunes here .
the group of beer drinkers that her industry has its eye on , those between 35 and 45 , is shrinking .
the fastest-growing age group in germany , the elderly , do not drink as much . " and young people like change , like to try something new and do not stick to one brand , one product , like their fathers , " she said . saturated market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ettikett einer flasche der berliner brauerei berliner kindl .

add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .

" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "

" i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .
" once you 've drunk a beer in germany , you can develop a certain love for it , " the chinese student said .
" and weihenstephan is the mecca of beer . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dry spell for german beer dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .

ja , bitte !
germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.04.2005 schalke suffers while bayern blooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalie frank rost watches his championship dreams fade the opening coin toss was about the only thing schalke won in its 4-1 loss to hertha berlin saturday , brining schalke 's chance at grabbing the german title from bayern munich to a screeching halt . hertha berlin trainer falko götz 's players proved his pre-match prophecy about a decisive win over second place schalke 04 true with a 4-1 victory .
the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .
a mere three points separate munich from a 19th german championship after a 3-1 triumph over ten-man vfl bochum helped felix magath 's side power nine points clear at the summit .
munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .
relegation zone excitement bildunterschrift : freiburg 's keeper richard golz , top , fights for the ball , but his team will still be playing in the second division next season though the top of the table is already clear , there 's still a lot to be decided at the bottom .
it 's clear that freiburg , who have won a miserly three games all season , are on their way to the second division after at 3-1 defeat at arminia bielefeld .
but it 's still unclear which other two teams will join them .
last year 's second division team mainz 05 improved its chances at staying in the top flight with a win over hanover 96 .

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .
" once you 've drunk a beer in germany , you can develop a certain love for it , " the chinese student said .
" and weihenstephan is the mecca of beer . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dry spell for german beer dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .
but a new generation of jews is more fixated on looking outward and changing perceptions . " i want to get rid of this feeling that when it 's about my religion everyone always thinks , ' oh , you 're a jew , ' and then immediately has the feeling that they 're stepping on eggshells and need to be very careful about what they say , " said katharina goos , a 29-year-old political science student , who converted to judaism two years ago . shedding the mystique in addition to cooking kosher and observing all of the jewish holidays , goos has also gotten involved in the jewish student association in berlin .
the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .
" we can open ourselves up to non-jews and say ' look at us , we 're not bad ' - and then we can enlighten a few people , " she said .

the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .
they are not only hated at home in england but everywhere in the world among fair minded decent people . - charles reichert , canada it is sad and unfair of british newspapers to attack the new pope , benedict xvi .
i , as a catholic , am deeply distressed because of this . - maria stec , us and poland yes , i think that it was in typical british style that the pope was indeed libeled and slandered .
i think he deserves an apology in just as bold a print .
moreover , i think the british prime minister should stand up and denounce this sort of journalism . - john breaux yes , the british newspapers are not only unfair with their treatment of our new pope , but they are also displaying their normal behavior about anything non-british .
they will probably end up giving a left-handed apology by saying that they " were just joshing . "
their humor even stinks ! - terry cummings the british press was not at all unfair to examine the past of pope benedict .
one 's life is formed by one 's past experiences .
the fact that the new pope served time in the hitler youth as a teenager is significant .
this is not to say one should not be allowed to move beyond one 's past though .
you have to remember the new pope is a mere mortal .
a pope is not capable of granting salvation and can not , therefore , be expected to be perfect .
our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?

even though he is supposed to be a catholic , he is a nasty one . - jj hubbard the sun and mirror headlines are not reflected in the actual coverage .
they give a balanced view of his theological stance as has , for example , the daily telegraph .
they also give a fair account of his position during the nazi period .
actually the headlines are " friendly jocular " in a typically british way .
another paper prefers to describe him as a german shepherd .
another has a cartoon of him shouting from his balcony ordering his swiss guards and staff to get into proper straight lines . - jack rice i think that when one considers what the mirror and sun had to say about the new pope , one must consider the source .
they are tabloid rags who live only to sensationalize to sell papers .
was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?

yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .
he even killed those who were loyal to him for being honest and speaking their minds .
i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .
we can not afford to throw stones and judge people by their past alone . - jennifer hurlock , us i think it is only expected that the secular media would demonize benedict xvi , a non-progressive pope .

also , the media wants to sell papers . - matthew schoolfield , us it does not surprise me in the least that one of england 's leading news services would publish such sentiment , in light of what they as a small country went through during the war years .
nor do i find it distasteful , for the one single reason : virtually everyone who served in the hitler youth movement and the nazi war criminals who came to the us has denied or played down their roles during the war years , 1930s and leading into the 1940s and onward . - john whitefox , us i do n't like the derogatory language that some of the media -lrb- particularly from the us -rrb- is using to speak of the pope .

ja , bitte !
germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 young jews in germany want normality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of jews does n't want to be treated differently with germany 's jewish community growing steadily in recent years , young jews are becoming more active .
their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .
but a new generation of jews is more fixated on looking outward and changing perceptions . " i want to get rid of this feeling that when it 's about my religion everyone always thinks , ' oh , you 're a jew , ' and then immediately has the feeling that they 're stepping on eggshells and need to be very careful about what they say , " said katharina goos , a 29-year-old political science student , who converted to judaism two years ago . shedding the mystique in addition to cooking kosher and observing all of the jewish holidays , goos has also gotten involved in the jewish student association in berlin .
the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .
" we can open ourselves up to non-jews and say ' look at us , we 're not bad ' - and then we can enlighten a few people , " she said .
bildunterschrift : the new synagogue in berlin , where the jewish community numbers more than 13,000 the transition from a community that has occupied a special , if somewhat fragile , place in german society to just another religious group is a difficult one to make . but as the generation of witnesses the atrocities against jews leading up to world war ii and to the holocaust passes , young jews like goos see a normalization of their community 's image as the way forward in a country struggling to break free of its past . germany a good place to live " i hope that people understand that judaism is not limited to sadness and that we have a flourishing jewish community in germany nowadays , the fastest-growing community in europe , and we 're a happy people , " said daniel iranyi , 25 .
the legal assistant moved to germany from israel with his parents when he was two .
" i love berlin , " he said .
" i like germany despite all of its weaknesses .
it 's still a good place to live , especially as a jew - even if some would disagree .
i see myself as a european with jewish background , or as a european jew .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .
but a new generation of jews is more fixated on looking outward and changing perceptions . " i want to get rid of this feeling that when it 's about my religion everyone always thinks , ' oh , you 're a jew , ' and then immediately has the feeling that they 're stepping on eggshells and need to be very careful about what they say , " said katharina goos , a 29-year-old political science student , who converted to judaism two years ago . shedding the mystique in addition to cooking kosher and observing all of the jewish holidays , goos has also gotten involved in the jewish student association in berlin .
the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .
" we can open ourselves up to non-jews and say ' look at us , we 're not bad ' - and then we can enlighten a few people , " she said .
bildunterschrift : the new synagogue in berlin , where the jewish community numbers more than 13,000 the transition from a community that has occupied a special , if somewhat fragile , place in german society to just another religious group is a difficult one to make . but as the generation of witnesses the atrocities against jews leading up to world war ii and to the holocaust passes , young jews like goos see a normalization of their community 's image as the way forward in a country struggling to break free of its past . germany a good place to live " i hope that people understand that judaism is not limited to sadness and that we have a flourishing jewish community in germany nowadays , the fastest-growing community in europe , and we 're a happy people , " said daniel iranyi , 25 .
the legal assistant moved to germany from israel with his parents when he was two .
" i love berlin , " he said .
" i like germany despite all of its weaknesses .
it 's still a good place to live , especially as a jew - even if some would disagree .
i see myself as a european with jewish background , or as a european jew .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2005 germany 's love affair with beer cools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a bit less of this going on these days contrary to popular cliche , beer in germany does n't come out of the kitchen faucet .

germans are drinking less of the sudsy stuff and brewers are getting alarmed . for foreigners , the old stereotype about a german social event has a bunch of rather portly germans in lederhosen sitting in a beer garden listening to oompah music , each with a stein full of frothy beer in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , chairman of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- well , few people drink out of the steins anymore - except for tourists , and the occasional politician -lrb- photo -rrb- , at oktoberfest - and more frequently these days where germans are relaxing , you 're almost as likely to see a glass of wine or a cocktail sitting in front of them instead of a beer . that 's the case at fluido , one of berlin 's hip bars in the trendy prenzlauer berg neighborhood , where there are a few glasses of red wine scattered about and a lot of brightly colored cocktails . " i think beer is just so boring and there 's such a variety when it comes to cocktails , " said sousa , a bartender .

beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .
in fact , between 1994 and 2003 , consumption shrank by more than 13 percent , according to brewers .
the trend does n't look like it 's going to turn around dramatically anytime soon , although the fall has levelled off somewhat over the past year . mineral water now beats beer on the popularity scale , part of which can be attributed to a new health consciousness among germans , especially younger ones .

" people just do n't want to be compared with daddy , who at 50 is carrying around a big beer belly with him . " it 's not that beer companies are n't trying to change a fusty image they feel is unfair .

the oetker group , one of germany 's biggest beer producers , announced it was closing it berliner kindl brewery in berlin , after 133 years . the brinkhoff brewery in the western germany city of dortmund faces the same fate .
according to stefan lepin of the raderberger group , a subsidiary of the oetker group , with almost 1,300 breweries , germany 's beer market is simply tapped out .
he said the unwelcome news about brewery closings will likely become more common in the future . " we have an estimated 30 to 40 percent overcapacity , " he said .
" consumption will drop again in the future and we think the consolidation of the market will go ahead . " while many people were upset at the closing of a traditional berlin brewery , not to mention at the loss of jobs , some of the younger in-crowd at fluido seem less concerned .

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .
" once you 've drunk a beer in germany , you can develop a certain love for it , " the chinese student said .
" and weihenstephan is the mecca of beer . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dry spell for german beer dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2005 germany 's love affair with beer cools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a bit less of this going on these days contrary to popular cliche , beer in germany does n't come out of the kitchen faucet .
in fact , it 's going into fewer glasses these days .
germans are drinking less of the sudsy stuff and brewers are getting alarmed . for foreigners , the old stereotype about a german social event has a bunch of rather portly germans in lederhosen sitting in a beer garden listening to oompah music , each with a stein full of frothy beer in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , chairman of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- well , few people drink out of the steins anymore - except for tourists , and the occasional politician -lrb- photo -rrb- , at oktoberfest - and more frequently these days where germans are relaxing , you 're almost as likely to see a glass of wine or a cocktail sitting in front of them instead of a beer . that 's the case at fluido , one of berlin 's hip bars in the trendy prenzlauer berg neighborhood , where there are a few glasses of red wine scattered about and a lot of brightly colored cocktails . " i think beer is just so boring and there 's such a variety when it comes to cocktails , " said sousa , a bartender .
" beer always tastes the same .
to quench your thirst in the beer garden in the summer , it 's nice enough .
but for all the time , i do n't know . " uncool those are words that keep the beer industry up at night .
beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .
in fact , between 1994 and 2003 , consumption shrank by more than 13 percent , according to brewers .
the trend does n't look like it 's going to turn around dramatically anytime soon , although the fall has levelled off somewhat over the past year . mineral water now beats beer on the popularity scale , part of which can be attributed to a new health consciousness among germans , especially younger ones .
they appear to prefer throwing back gatorade at the gym instead of guzzling pints at the corner bar .
slim and trim is in , a beer gut is not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a new concept munich beer garden owners try to reach younger people .
our picture shows a young couple drinking a caipirinha-cocktail out of a 1-litre jug .
" beer is n't considered cool anymore , " said andreas , who had just ordered a mojito cocktail at fluido .
" people just do n't want to be compared with daddy , who at 50 is carrying around a big beer belly with him . " it 's not that beer companies are n't trying to change a fusty image they feel is unfair .
beer companies are looking for a facelift , putting their products in new bottles with new names , eye-catching labels and new advertising strategies . " beer in itself is not fattening , " insisted birte kleppien , spokeswoman of the german brewers ' association .
" it depends on what you eat with it . " according to her , demographic shifts in germany are hurting beer 's fortunes here .
the group of beer drinkers that her industry has its eye on , those between 35 and 45 , is shrinking .
the fastest-growing age group in germany , the elderly , do not drink as much . " and young people like change , like to try something new and do not stick to one brand , one product , like their fathers , " she said . saturated market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ettikett einer flasche der berliner brauerei berliner kindl .
2005 the result has been a rash of brewery closings .
the oetker group , one of germany 's biggest beer producers , announced it was closing it berliner kindl brewery in berlin , after 133 years . the brinkhoff brewery in the western germany city of dortmund faces the same fate .
according to stefan lepin of the raderberger group , a subsidiary of the oetker group , with almost 1,300 breweries , germany 's beer market is simply tapped out .
he said the unwelcome news about brewery closings will likely become more common in the future . " we have an estimated 30 to 40 percent overcapacity , " he said .
" consumption will drop again in the future and we think the consolidation of the market will go ahead . " while many people were upset at the closing of a traditional berlin brewery , not to mention at the loss of jobs , some of the younger in-crowd at fluido seem less concerned .
they are enjoying the broader palette of drink options available these days in germany .
but it was n't always that way . " maybe the germans have simply become a little more cultivated when it comes to drinking , " said michaela , who was having a cosmopolitan with her boyfriend at the bar .
" people put more value on drinking a nice wine or a cocktail , because now we can .
i think 20 years ago we did n't have these types of cocktail bars . " but the industry 's not going down without a fight .
they are determined to lure those customers back who are always in search of the new , the latest , the most unusual .

the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .
they are not only hated at home in england but everywhere in the world among fair minded decent people . - charles reichert , canada it is sad and unfair of british newspapers to attack the new pope , benedict xvi .
i , as a catholic , am deeply distressed because of this . - maria stec , us and poland yes , i think that it was in typical british style that the pope was indeed libeled and slandered .
i think he deserves an apology in just as bold a print .
moreover , i think the british prime minister should stand up and denounce this sort of journalism . - john breaux yes , the british newspapers are not only unfair with their treatment of our new pope , but they are also displaying their normal behavior about anything non-british .
they will probably end up giving a left-handed apology by saying that they " were just joshing . "
their humor even stinks ! - terry cummings the british press was not at all unfair to examine the past of pope benedict .
one 's life is formed by one 's past experiences .
the fact that the new pope served time in the hitler youth as a teenager is significant .
this is not to say one should not be allowed to move beyond one 's past though .
you have to remember the new pope is a mere mortal .
a pope is not capable of granting salvation and can not , therefore , be expected to be perfect .
our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?
and just let him show us what a great successor of the great john paul ii he can be ? - ximena lara , mexico german newspapers should get angry at rupert murdoch and not the british people since he owns and closely rules the editorial stance of all .
even though he is supposed to be a catholic , he is a nasty one . - jj hubbard the sun and mirror headlines are not reflected in the actual coverage .
they give a balanced view of his theological stance as has , for example , the daily telegraph .
they also give a fair account of his position during the nazi period .
actually the headlines are " friendly jocular " in a typically british way .
another paper prefers to describe him as a german shepherd .
another has a cartoon of him shouting from his balcony ordering his swiss guards and staff to get into proper straight lines . - jack rice i think that when one considers what the mirror and sun had to say about the new pope , one must consider the source .
they are tabloid rags who live only to sensationalize to sell papers .
was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?
was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .
he even killed those who were loyal to him for being honest and speaking their minds .
i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .
we can not afford to throw stones and judge people by their past alone . - jennifer hurlock , us i think it is only expected that the secular media would demonize benedict xvi , a non-progressive pope .
traditionalists are no longer welcome in the mainstream media , even if they are the head of a traditional institution , such as the catholic church .
also , the media wants to sell papers . - matthew schoolfield , us it does not surprise me in the least that one of england 's leading news services would publish such sentiment , in light of what they as a small country went through during the war years .
nor do i find it distasteful , for the one single reason : virtually everyone who served in the hitler youth movement and the nazi war criminals who came to the us has denied or played down their roles during the war years , 1930s and leading into the 1940s and onward . - john whitefox , us i do n't like the derogatory language that some of the media -lrb- particularly from the us -rrb- is using to speak of the pope .
let 's give the man the benefit of the doubt .
i 'm sure he 'll end up doing an excellent job . - milena barrios , columbia i was happy to read your report regarding the nazi labels put on pope benedict xvi by the british media .
i live in canada and here we also had some of those comments on prime time tv news by the major broadcasters .
i was offended by the labels and am not german , but a catholic . - rvkulak , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " nazi " attacks on pope anger germans germany 's top-selling newspaper " bild " was furious on thursday at the coverage of the new pope by british newspapers , which had accentuated benedict xvi 's past as a teenager in nazi germany .

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .
" once you 've drunk a beer in germany , you can develop a certain love for it , " the chinese student said .
" and weihenstephan is the mecca of beer . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dry spell for german beer dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2005 germany 's love affair with beer cools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a bit less of this going on these days contrary to popular cliche , beer in germany does n't come out of the kitchen faucet .
in fact , it 's going into fewer glasses these days .
germans are drinking less of the sudsy stuff and brewers are getting alarmed . for foreigners , the old stereotype about a german social event has a bunch of rather portly germans in lederhosen sitting in a beer garden listening to oompah music , each with a stein full of frothy beer in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , chairman of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- well , few people drink out of the steins anymore - except for tourists , and the occasional politician -lrb- photo -rrb- , at oktoberfest - and more frequently these days where germans are relaxing , you 're almost as likely to see a glass of wine or a cocktail sitting in front of them instead of a beer . that 's the case at fluido , one of berlin 's hip bars in the trendy prenzlauer berg neighborhood , where there are a few glasses of red wine scattered about and a lot of brightly colored cocktails . " i think beer is just so boring and there 's such a variety when it comes to cocktails , " said sousa , a bartender .
" beer always tastes the same .
to quench your thirst in the beer garden in the summer , it 's nice enough .
but for all the time , i do n't know . " uncool those are words that keep the beer industry up at night .
beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .
in fact , between 1994 and 2003 , consumption shrank by more than 13 percent , according to brewers .
the trend does n't look like it 's going to turn around dramatically anytime soon , although the fall has levelled off somewhat over the past year . mineral water now beats beer on the popularity scale , part of which can be attributed to a new health consciousness among germans , especially younger ones .
they appear to prefer throwing back gatorade at the gym instead of guzzling pints at the corner bar .
slim and trim is in , a beer gut is not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a new concept munich beer garden owners try to reach younger people .
our picture shows a young couple drinking a caipirinha-cocktail out of a 1-litre jug .
" beer is n't considered cool anymore , " said andreas , who had just ordered a mojito cocktail at fluido .
" people just do n't want to be compared with daddy , who at 50 is carrying around a big beer belly with him . " it 's not that beer companies are n't trying to change a fusty image they feel is unfair .
beer companies are looking for a facelift , putting their products in new bottles with new names , eye-catching labels and new advertising strategies . " beer in itself is not fattening , " insisted birte kleppien , spokeswoman of the german brewers ' association .
" it depends on what you eat with it . " according to her , demographic shifts in germany are hurting beer 's fortunes here .
the group of beer drinkers that her industry has its eye on , those between 35 and 45 , is shrinking .
the fastest-growing age group in germany , the elderly , do not drink as much . " and young people like change , like to try something new and do not stick to one brand , one product , like their fathers , " she said . saturated market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ettikett einer flasche der berliner brauerei berliner kindl .
2005 the result has been a rash of brewery closings .
the oetker group , one of germany 's biggest beer producers , announced it was closing it berliner kindl brewery in berlin , after 133 years . the brinkhoff brewery in the western germany city of dortmund faces the same fate .
according to stefan lepin of the raderberger group , a subsidiary of the oetker group , with almost 1,300 breweries , germany 's beer market is simply tapped out .
he said the unwelcome news about brewery closings will likely become more common in the future . " we have an estimated 30 to 40 percent overcapacity , " he said .
" consumption will drop again in the future and we think the consolidation of the market will go ahead . " while many people were upset at the closing of a traditional berlin brewery , not to mention at the loss of jobs , some of the younger in-crowd at fluido seem less concerned .
they are enjoying the broader palette of drink options available these days in germany .
but it was n't always that way . " maybe the germans have simply become a little more cultivated when it comes to drinking , " said michaela , who was having a cosmopolitan with her boyfriend at the bar .
" people put more value on drinking a nice wine or a cocktail , because now we can .
i think 20 years ago we did n't have these types of cocktail bars . " but the industry 's not going down without a fight .
they are determined to lure those customers back who are always in search of the new , the latest , the most unusual .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.04.2005 schalke suffers while bayern blooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalie frank rost watches his championship dreams fade the opening coin toss was about the only thing schalke won in its 4-1 loss to hertha berlin saturday , brining schalke 's chance at grabbing the german title from bayern munich to a screeching halt . hertha berlin trainer falko götz 's players proved his pre-match prophecy about a decisive win over second place schalke 04 true with a 4-1 victory .
the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .
a mere three points separate munich from a 19th german championship after a 3-1 triumph over ten-man vfl bochum helped felix magath 's side power nine points clear at the summit .
munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .
relegation zone excitement bildunterschrift : freiburg 's keeper richard golz , top , fights for the ball , but his team will still be playing in the second division next season though the top of the table is already clear , there 's still a lot to be decided at the bottom .
it 's clear that freiburg , who have won a miserly three games all season , are on their way to the second division after at 3-1 defeat at arminia bielefeld .
but it 's still unclear which other two teams will join them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 23.04.2005 schalke suffers while bayern blooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke goalie frank rost watches his championship dreams fade the opening coin toss was about the only thing schalke won in its 4-1 loss to hertha berlin saturday , brining schalke 's chance at grabbing the german title from bayern munich to a screeching halt . hertha berlin trainer falko götz 's players proved his pre-match prophecy about a decisive win over second place schalke 04 true with a 4-1 victory .
the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .
a mere three points separate munich from a 19th german championship after a 3-1 triumph over ten-man vfl bochum helped felix magath 's side power nine points clear at the summit .
munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .
but a new generation of jews is more fixated on looking outward and changing perceptions . " i want to get rid of this feeling that when it 's about my religion everyone always thinks , ' oh , you 're a jew , ' and then immediately has the feeling that they 're stepping on eggshells and need to be very careful about what they say , " said katharina goos , a 29-year-old political science student , who converted to judaism two years ago . shedding the mystique in addition to cooking kosher and observing all of the jewish holidays , goos has also gotten involved in the jewish student association in berlin .
the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .
" we can open ourselves up to non-jews and say ' look at us , we 're not bad ' - and then we can enlighten a few people , " she said .
bildunterschrift : the new synagogue in berlin , where the jewish community numbers more than 13,000 the transition from a community that has occupied a special , if somewhat fragile , place in german society to just another religious group is a difficult one to make . but as the generation of witnesses the atrocities against jews leading up to world war ii and to the holocaust passes , young jews like goos see a normalization of their community 's image as the way forward in a country struggling to break free of its past . germany a good place to live " i hope that people understand that judaism is not limited to sadness and that we have a flourishing jewish community in germany nowadays , the fastest-growing community in europe , and we 're a happy people , " said daniel iranyi , 25 .
the legal assistant moved to germany from israel with his parents when he was two .
" i love berlin , " he said .
" i like germany despite all of its weaknesses .
it 's still a good place to live , especially as a jew - even if some would disagree .

but those helping pilgrims find accommodation during their visit said they still had to turn people down . " i keep telling them : ' every place we know of is booked , " ' antonio tedesco of the german pilgrims ' center , told german public broadcaster br .
" and still people decide to come even though they do n't know where they will stay . " christian meyer , who also works for the center , said that he 's started telling people to sleep in their cars outside of town . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georg ratzinger -lrb- right -rrb- with his brother , then cardinal joseph ratzinger .

" it 's nice that families , parishes and organizations calls us and say : ' we still have a room that we can offer you , " ' he said . as up to 100,000 pilgrims are expected to come from germany , italy 's security and first aid officials have taken steps to limit communication problems . " this time we have a lot of volunteers from south tyrolia , because they can speak german and italian , " francesco pintofricaldi , the head of italy 's maltese order aid service , adding that about 1,500 people are coming from the northern italian region .
" they 'll be able to help better when people get lost or ca n't find their bus any more . " nato help security precautions have also been taken : nato will provide awacs surveillance planes to warn against any threat to the ceremony , which is expected to begin at 10 a.m. local time . the airborne early warning and control -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft will be deployed from a base in italy to guard the airspace around the vatican , a nato military spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : roman police motorbikes lined up at st. peters square " italian authorities will determine the specific coverage requirements , " said the supreme headquarters allied forces europe -lrb- shape -rrb- , adding that there is a fleet of 17 awacs planes available . the nato aircraft can provide a clear picture of aircraft movements from high to low altitude to a distance greater than 200 miles -lrb- about 320 kilometers -rrb- , said nato 's military command . thanking the media benedict xvi on saturday meanwhile did his part in making sure the event 's coverage will run smoothly : he met with 4,000 journalists and their families in a 15-minute audience and thanked them for their hard work since the death of john paul ii . " thanks to your hard work , the attention of the entire world has been fixed on the vatican , saint peter 's square and the apostolic palace , " he said in italian .
" i know how much you have worked in recent days , and that it was very hard work , away from your homes and families .
i appreciate the ability and dedication with which you carried out your work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi during his first audience on saturday speaking also in english , french and german - which drew special applause from the german press corps - he hailed what he called an " extraordinary media revolution , " saying : " the possibilities available to us through modern social communications are truly extraordinary . " finally , though , he said " since we are in rome , we 'll go back to italian . " he pledged to continue the " affectionate dialogue " with the media begun in earnest by his telegenic predecessor , saying : " john paul ii was the great artisan of this open dialogue .

the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .
they are not only hated at home in england but everywhere in the world among fair minded decent people . - charles reichert , canada it is sad and unfair of british newspapers to attack the new pope , benedict xvi .
i , as a catholic , am deeply distressed because of this . - maria stec , us and poland yes , i think that it was in typical british style that the pope was indeed libeled and slandered .
i think he deserves an apology in just as bold a print .
moreover , i think the british prime minister should stand up and denounce this sort of journalism . - john breaux yes , the british newspapers are not only unfair with their treatment of our new pope , but they are also displaying their normal behavior about anything non-british .
they will probably end up giving a left-handed apology by saying that they " were just joshing . "
their humor even stinks ! - terry cummings the british press was not at all unfair to examine the past of pope benedict .
one 's life is formed by one 's past experiences .
the fact that the new pope served time in the hitler youth as a teenager is significant .
this is not to say one should not be allowed to move beyond one 's past though .
you have to remember the new pope is a mere mortal .
a pope is not capable of granting salvation and can not , therefore , be expected to be perfect .
our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?
and just let him show us what a great successor of the great john paul ii he can be ? - ximena lara , mexico german newspapers should get angry at rupert murdoch and not the british people since he owns and closely rules the editorial stance of all .
even though he is supposed to be a catholic , he is a nasty one . - jj hubbard the sun and mirror headlines are not reflected in the actual coverage .
they give a balanced view of his theological stance as has , for example , the daily telegraph .
they also give a fair account of his position during the nazi period .
actually the headlines are " friendly jocular " in a typically british way .
another paper prefers to describe him as a german shepherd .
another has a cartoon of him shouting from his balcony ordering his swiss guards and staff to get into proper straight lines . - jack rice i think that when one considers what the mirror and sun had to say about the new pope , one must consider the source .
they are tabloid rags who live only to sensationalize to sell papers .
was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?
was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .
he even killed those who were loyal to him for being honest and speaking their minds .
i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .

the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .

our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?

was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .

anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .

anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .
he even killed those who were loyal to him for being honest and speaking their minds .
i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .
we can not afford to throw stones and judge people by their past alone . - jennifer hurlock , us i think it is only expected that the secular media would demonize benedict xvi , a non-progressive pope .
traditionalists are no longer welcome in the mainstream media , even if they are the head of a traditional institution , such as the catholic church .
also , the media wants to sell papers . - matthew schoolfield , us it does not surprise me in the least that one of england 's leading news services would publish such sentiment , in light of what they as a small country went through during the war years .
nor do i find it distasteful , for the one single reason : virtually everyone who served in the hitler youth movement and the nazi war criminals who came to the us has denied or played down their roles during the war years , 1930s and leading into the 1940s and onward . - john whitefox , us i do n't like the derogatory language that some of the media -lrb- particularly from the us -rrb- is using to speak of the pope .
let 's give the man the benefit of the doubt .
i 'm sure he 'll end up doing an excellent job . - milena barrios , columbia i was happy to read your report regarding the nazi labels put on pope benedict xvi by the british media .
i live in canada and here we also had some of those comments on prime time tv news by the major broadcasters .
i was offended by the labels and am not german , but a catholic . - rvkulak , canada compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " nazi " attacks on pope anger germans germany 's top-selling newspaper " bild " was furious on thursday at the coverage of the new pope by british newspapers , which had accentuated benedict xvi 's past as a teenager in nazi germany .

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .
" once you 've drunk a beer in germany , you can develop a certain love for it , " the chinese student said .
" and weihenstephan is the mecca of beer . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dry spell for german beer dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .
" once you 've drunk a beer in germany , you can develop a certain love for it , " the chinese student said .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .
but a new generation of jews is more fixated on looking outward and changing perceptions . " i want to get rid of this feeling that when it 's about my religion everyone always thinks , ' oh , you 're a jew , ' and then immediately has the feeling that they 're stepping on eggshells and need to be very careful about what they say , " said katharina goos , a 29-year-old political science student , who converted to judaism two years ago . shedding the mystique in addition to cooking kosher and observing all of the jewish holidays , goos has also gotten involved in the jewish student association in berlin .
the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .
" we can open ourselves up to non-jews and say ' look at us , we 're not bad ' - and then we can enlighten a few people , " she said .
bildunterschrift : the new synagogue in berlin , where the jewish community numbers more than 13,000 the transition from a community that has occupied a special , if somewhat fragile , place in german society to just another religious group is a difficult one to make . but as the generation of witnesses the atrocities against jews leading up to world war ii and to the holocaust passes , young jews like goos see a normalization of their community 's image as the way forward in a country struggling to break free of its past . germany a good place to live " i hope that people understand that judaism is not limited to sadness and that we have a flourishing jewish community in germany nowadays , the fastest-growing community in europe , and we 're a happy people , " said daniel iranyi , 25 .
the legal assistant moved to germany from israel with his parents when he was two .
" i love berlin , " he said .
" i like germany despite all of its weaknesses .
it 's still a good place to live , especially as a jew - even if some would disagree .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .

the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .

add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .

german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2005 germany 's love affair with beer cools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a bit less of this going on these days contrary to popular cliche , beer in germany does n't come out of the kitchen faucet .
in fact , it 's going into fewer glasses these days .
germans are drinking less of the sudsy stuff and brewers are getting alarmed . for foreigners , the old stereotype about a german social event has a bunch of rather portly germans in lederhosen sitting in a beer garden listening to oompah music , each with a stein full of frothy beer in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , chairman of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- well , few people drink out of the steins anymore - except for tourists , and the occasional politician -lrb- photo -rrb- , at oktoberfest - and more frequently these days where germans are relaxing , you 're almost as likely to see a glass of wine or a cocktail sitting in front of them instead of a beer . that 's the case at fluido , one of berlin 's hip bars in the trendy prenzlauer berg neighborhood , where there are a few glasses of red wine scattered about and a lot of brightly colored cocktails . " i think beer is just so boring and there 's such a variety when it comes to cocktails , " said sousa , a bartender .
" beer always tastes the same .
to quench your thirst in the beer garden in the summer , it 's nice enough .
but for all the time , i do n't know . " uncool those are words that keep the beer industry up at night .
beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .
in fact , between 1994 and 2003 , consumption shrank by more than 13 percent , according to brewers .
the trend does n't look like it 's going to turn around dramatically anytime soon , although the fall has levelled off somewhat over the past year . mineral water now beats beer on the popularity scale , part of which can be attributed to a new health consciousness among germans , especially younger ones .
they appear to prefer throwing back gatorade at the gym instead of guzzling pints at the corner bar .
slim and trim is in , a beer gut is not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a new concept munich beer garden owners try to reach younger people .
our picture shows a young couple drinking a caipirinha-cocktail out of a 1-litre jug .
" beer is n't considered cool anymore , " said andreas , who had just ordered a mojito cocktail at fluido .
" people just do n't want to be compared with daddy , who at 50 is carrying around a big beer belly with him . " it 's not that beer companies are n't trying to change a fusty image they feel is unfair .
beer companies are looking for a facelift , putting their products in new bottles with new names , eye-catching labels and new advertising strategies . " beer in itself is not fattening , " insisted birte kleppien , spokeswoman of the german brewers ' association .
" it depends on what you eat with it . " according to her , demographic shifts in germany are hurting beer 's fortunes here .
the group of beer drinkers that her industry has its eye on , those between 35 and 45 , is shrinking .
the fastest-growing age group in germany , the elderly , do not drink as much . " and young people like change , like to try something new and do not stick to one brand , one product , like their fathers , " she said . saturated market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ettikett einer flasche der berliner brauerei berliner kindl .
2005 the result has been a rash of brewery closings .
the oetker group , one of germany 's biggest beer producers , announced it was closing it berliner kindl brewery in berlin , after 133 years . the brinkhoff brewery in the western germany city of dortmund faces the same fate .
according to stefan lepin of the raderberger group , a subsidiary of the oetker group , with almost 1,300 breweries , germany 's beer market is simply tapped out .
he said the unwelcome news about brewery closings will likely become more common in the future . " we have an estimated 30 to 40 percent overcapacity , " he said .
" consumption will drop again in the future and we think the consolidation of the market will go ahead . " while many people were upset at the closing of a traditional berlin brewery , not to mention at the loss of jobs , some of the younger in-crowd at fluido seem less concerned .
they are enjoying the broader palette of drink options available these days in germany .
but it was n't always that way . " maybe the germans have simply become a little more cultivated when it comes to drinking , " said michaela , who was having a cosmopolitan with her boyfriend at the bar .
" people put more value on drinking a nice wine or a cocktail , because now we can .
i think 20 years ago we did n't have these types of cocktail bars . " but the industry 's not going down without a fight .
they are determined to lure those customers back who are always in search of the new , the latest , the most unusual .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .
but a new generation of jews is more fixated on looking outward and changing perceptions . " i want to get rid of this feeling that when it 's about my religion everyone always thinks , ' oh , you 're a jew , ' and then immediately has the feeling that they 're stepping on eggshells and need to be very careful about what they say , " said katharina goos , a 29-year-old political science student , who converted to judaism two years ago . shedding the mystique in addition to cooking kosher and observing all of the jewish holidays , goos has also gotten involved in the jewish student association in berlin .
the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .
" we can open ourselves up to non-jews and say ' look at us , we 're not bad ' - and then we can enlighten a few people , " she said .
bildunterschrift : the new synagogue in berlin , where the jewish community numbers more than 13,000 the transition from a community that has occupied a special , if somewhat fragile , place in german society to just another religious group is a difficult one to make . but as the generation of witnesses the atrocities against jews leading up to world war ii and to the holocaust passes , young jews like goos see a normalization of their community 's image as the way forward in a country struggling to break free of its past . germany a good place to live " i hope that people understand that judaism is not limited to sadness and that we have a flourishing jewish community in germany nowadays , the fastest-growing community in europe , and we 're a happy people , " said daniel iranyi , 25 .
the legal assistant moved to germany from israel with his parents when he was two .
" i love berlin , " he said .
" i like germany despite all of its weaknesses .
it 's still a good place to live , especially as a jew - even if some would disagree .

ja , bitte !
german beer : worth a scientific look business -pipe- 23.04.2005 germany 's love affair with beer cools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a bit less of this going on these days contrary to popular cliche , beer in germany does n't come out of the kitchen faucet .
in fact , it 's going into fewer glasses these days .
germans are drinking less of the sudsy stuff and brewers are getting alarmed . for foreigners , the old stereotype about a german social event has a bunch of rather portly germans in lederhosen sitting in a beer garden listening to oompah music , each with a stein full of frothy beer in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber , chairman of the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- well , few people drink out of the steins anymore - except for tourists , and the occasional politician -lrb- photo -rrb- , at oktoberfest - and more frequently these days where germans are relaxing , you 're almost as likely to see a glass of wine or a cocktail sitting in front of them instead of a beer . that 's the case at fluido , one of berlin 's hip bars in the trendy prenzlauer berg neighborhood , where there are a few glasses of red wine scattered about and a lot of brightly colored cocktails . " i think beer is just so boring and there 's such a variety when it comes to cocktails , " said sousa , a bartender .
" beer always tastes the same .
to quench your thirst in the beer garden in the summer , it 's nice enough .
but for all the time , i do n't know . " uncool those are words that keep the beer industry up at night .
beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .
in fact , between 1994 and 2003 , consumption shrank by more than 13 percent , according to brewers .
the trend does n't look like it 's going to turn around dramatically anytime soon , although the fall has levelled off somewhat over the past year . mineral water now beats beer on the popularity scale , part of which can be attributed to a new health consciousness among germans , especially younger ones .
they appear to prefer throwing back gatorade at the gym instead of guzzling pints at the corner bar .
slim and trim is in , a beer gut is not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a new concept munich beer garden owners try to reach younger people .
our picture shows a young couple drinking a caipirinha-cocktail out of a 1-litre jug .
" beer is n't considered cool anymore , " said andreas , who had just ordered a mojito cocktail at fluido .
" people just do n't want to be compared with daddy , who at 50 is carrying around a big beer belly with him . " it 's not that beer companies are n't trying to change a fusty image they feel is unfair .
beer companies are looking for a facelift , putting their products in new bottles with new names , eye-catching labels and new advertising strategies . " beer in itself is not fattening , " insisted birte kleppien , spokeswoman of the german brewers ' association .
" it depends on what you eat with it . " according to her , demographic shifts in germany are hurting beer 's fortunes here .
the group of beer drinkers that her industry has its eye on , those between 35 and 45 , is shrinking .
the fastest-growing age group in germany , the elderly , do not drink as much . " and young people like change , like to try something new and do not stick to one brand , one product , like their fathers , " she said . saturated market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ettikett einer flasche der berliner brauerei berliner kindl .
2005 the result has been a rash of brewery closings .
the oetker group , one of germany 's biggest beer producers , announced it was closing it berliner kindl brewery in berlin , after 133 years . the brinkhoff brewery in the western germany city of dortmund faces the same fate .
according to stefan lepin of the raderberger group , a subsidiary of the oetker group , with almost 1,300 breweries , germany 's beer market is simply tapped out .
he said the unwelcome news about brewery closings will likely become more common in the future . " we have an estimated 30 to 40 percent overcapacity , " he said .
" consumption will drop again in the future and we think the consolidation of the market will go ahead . " while many people were upset at the closing of a traditional berlin brewery , not to mention at the loss of jobs , some of the younger in-crowd at fluido seem less concerned .
they are enjoying the broader palette of drink options available these days in germany .
but it was n't always that way . " maybe the germans have simply become a little more cultivated when it comes to drinking , " said michaela , who was having a cosmopolitan with her boyfriend at the bar .
" people put more value on drinking a nice wine or a cocktail , because now we can .
i think 20 years ago we did n't have these types of cocktail bars . " but the industry 's not going down without a fight .
they are determined to lure those customers back who are always in search of the new , the latest , the most unusual .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .
but a new generation of jews is more fixated on looking outward and changing perceptions . " i want to get rid of this feeling that when it 's about my religion everyone always thinks , ' oh , you 're a jew , ' and then immediately has the feeling that they 're stepping on eggshells and need to be very careful about what they say , " said katharina goos , a 29-year-old political science student , who converted to judaism two years ago . shedding the mystique in addition to cooking kosher and observing all of the jewish holidays , goos has also gotten involved in the jewish student association in berlin .
the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .
" we can open ourselves up to non-jews and say ' look at us , we 're not bad ' - and then we can enlighten a few people , " she said .
bildunterschrift : the new synagogue in berlin , where the jewish community numbers more than 13,000 the transition from a community that has occupied a special , if somewhat fragile , place in german society to just another religious group is a difficult one to make . but as the generation of witnesses the atrocities against jews leading up to world war ii and to the holocaust passes , young jews like goos see a normalization of their community 's image as the way forward in a country struggling to break free of its past . germany a good place to live " i hope that people understand that judaism is not limited to sadness and that we have a flourishing jewish community in germany nowadays , the fastest-growing community in europe , and we 're a happy people , " said daniel iranyi , 25 .
the legal assistant moved to germany from israel with his parents when he was two .
" i love berlin , " he said .
" i like germany despite all of its weaknesses .
it 's still a good place to live , especially as a jew - even if some would disagree .
i see myself as a european with jewish background , or as a european jew .

the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .
munich nearly assured of championship in other german league action , bayern munich have all but mathematically sealed their spot as bundesliga champs , needing just one more win from their remaining four matches this season .
a mere three points separate munich from a 19th german championship after a 3-1 triumph over ten-man vfl bochum helped felix magath 's side power nine points clear at the summit .
munich 's peruvian star claudio pizarro putting the hosts in front after just nine minutes .
dutch international roy makaay struck a goal-bound shot and compatriot van duijnhoven saved brilliantly with his left hand but he was well outside of his penalty area and subsequently red-carded .
after seeing the keeper sent off , the rest of the bochum squad self-destructed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's midfielder michael ballack has plenty to be happy about german international michael ballack doubled munich 's lead after 26 minutes but bochum pulled one back in the 51st minute with a filip tapalovic header .
it was makaay who quashed any fears of a comeback with a ruthless finish on 63 minutes as bayern cruised to victory .
stuttgart edges forward third-placed stuttgart could have leapfrogged schalke into second but played out a scoreless home draw with vfl wolfsburg at the gottlieb-daimler stadium .
reigning german champions werder bremen can also move to within three points of schalke providing they can win at bayer leverkusen on sunday .

beer consumption has been falling steadily in germany for almost a decade now .

according to stefan lepin of the raderberger group , a subsidiary of the oetker group , with almost 1,300 breweries , germany 's beer market is simply tapped out .
he said the unwelcome news about brewery closings will likely become more common in the future . " we have an estimated 30 to 40 percent overcapacity , " he said .

the win brings berlin 's dream of a champions league berth a little closer , while schalke continues to feel third-placed stuttgart bearing down , just a point behind the royal blues .
five weeks ago schalke were three points ahead of bayern at the summit but four defeats in five games now sees them nine points adrift of their arch rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals and an assist , berlin 's marcelinho , left , nearly turned the match into a one-man show berlin 's brazilian international marcelinho continued to impress by scoring two of hertha 's four goals , including one from the penalty spot , and posting an additional assist .
the two goals put marcelinho at the top of the bundesliga scorer table with 17 goals and 13 assists .
few highlights in berlin scoring in the german capital opened in the fifth minute in what would overall prove to be a dreary match .
it was yildiray bastürk who took a pass from marcelinho past schalke defender tomasz waldoch and goalie frank rost , whose left foot was able to change the shot 's trajectory but not its destination .
though ebbe sand scored on a schalke corner kick in the 17th minute after the ball bounced through the berlin defense , it was sand 's teammate christian poulsen who caused the most excitement on the schalke side .
he was sent off in the 21st minute after he collected two yellow cards inside of five minutes .
the match could have ended shortly after poulsen was sent off , as the sold-out crowd in berlin 's olympic stadium were treated to only a handful of exciting scenes .
bildunterschrift : berlin 's nando rafael celebrates his goal that put hertha up 3-1 the crowd did get excited when hertha striker nando rafael chipped a beautiful lob over rost , putting berlin ahead 3-1 and when marcelinho capped the scoring in the 59th minute .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .
but a new generation of jews is more fixated on looking outward and changing perceptions . " i want to get rid of this feeling that when it 's about my religion everyone always thinks , ' oh , you 're a jew , ' and then immediately has the feeling that they 're stepping on eggshells and need to be very careful about what they say , " said katharina goos , a 29-year-old political science student , who converted to judaism two years ago . shedding the mystique in addition to cooking kosher and observing all of the jewish holidays , goos has also gotten involved in the jewish student association in berlin .
the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .
" we can open ourselves up to non-jews and say ' look at us , we 're not bad ' - and then we can enlighten a few people , " she said .
bildunterschrift : the new synagogue in berlin , where the jewish community numbers more than 13,000 the transition from a community that has occupied a special , if somewhat fragile , place in german society to just another religious group is a difficult one to make . but as the generation of witnesses the atrocities against jews leading up to world war ii and to the holocaust passes , young jews like goos see a normalization of their community 's image as the way forward in a country struggling to break free of its past . germany a good place to live " i hope that people understand that judaism is not limited to sadness and that we have a flourishing jewish community in germany nowadays , the fastest-growing community in europe , and we 're a happy people , " said daniel iranyi , 25 .
the legal assistant moved to germany from israel with his parents when he was two .
" i love berlin , " he said .
" i like germany despite all of its weaknesses .
it 's still a good place to live , especially as a jew - even if some would disagree .
i see myself as a european with jewish background , or as a european jew .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 young jews in germany want normality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next generation of jews does n't want to be treated differently with germany 's jewish community growing steadily in recent years , young jews are becoming more active .
their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .
but a new generation of jews is more fixated on looking outward and changing perceptions . " i want to get rid of this feeling that when it 's about my religion everyone always thinks , ' oh , you 're a jew , ' and then immediately has the feeling that they 're stepping on eggshells and need to be very careful about what they say , " said katharina goos , a 29-year-old political science student , who converted to judaism two years ago . shedding the mystique in addition to cooking kosher and observing all of the jewish holidays , goos has also gotten involved in the jewish student association in berlin .
the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .
" we can open ourselves up to non-jews and say ' look at us , we 're not bad ' - and then we can enlighten a few people , " she said .
bildunterschrift : the new synagogue in berlin , where the jewish community numbers more than 13,000 the transition from a community that has occupied a special , if somewhat fragile , place in german society to just another religious group is a difficult one to make . but as the generation of witnesses the atrocities against jews leading up to world war ii and to the holocaust passes , young jews like goos see a normalization of their community 's image as the way forward in a country struggling to break free of its past . germany a good place to live " i hope that people understand that judaism is not limited to sadness and that we have a flourishing jewish community in germany nowadays , the fastest-growing community in europe , and we 're a happy people , " said daniel iranyi , 25 .
the legal assistant moved to germany from israel with his parents when he was two .
" i love berlin , " he said .
" i like germany despite all of its weaknesses .

the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .
they are not only hated at home in england but everywhere in the world among fair minded decent people . - charles reichert , canada it is sad and unfair of british newspapers to attack the new pope , benedict xvi .
i , as a catholic , am deeply distressed because of this . - maria stec , us and poland yes , i think that it was in typical british style that the pope was indeed libeled and slandered .
i think he deserves an apology in just as bold a print .
moreover , i think the british prime minister should stand up and denounce this sort of journalism . - john breaux yes , the british newspapers are not only unfair with their treatment of our new pope , but they are also displaying their normal behavior about anything non-british .
they will probably end up giving a left-handed apology by saying that they " were just joshing . "
their humor even stinks ! - terry cummings the british press was not at all unfair to examine the past of pope benedict .
one 's life is formed by one 's past experiences .
the fact that the new pope served time in the hitler youth as a teenager is significant .

you have to remember the new pope is a mere mortal .
a pope is not capable of granting salvation and can not , therefore , be expected to be perfect .
our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?

was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?
was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .

i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .

on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "

" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .

" i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .

germany 's love affair with beer cools culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.04.2005 german beer : worth a scientific look großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're really just testing beer it only takes four ingredients to make a bottle of german beer : hops , malt , water and yeast .
add anything else and you 'll turn a national drink into a motley punch unworthy of consumption in the country 's beer gardens . whether it 's taken on tap , in a bottle or a multi-liter bucket , beer takes center stage on april 23rd - germany 's day devoted to beer .
on this day in 1516 , bavaria 's then ruler , duke william iv , passed the so-called " purity law . "
while the name seems to imply an age-old method of enforcing teutonic morals , the decree is actually the world 's oldest food-related law and limits beer to just three ingredients : hops , malt and water .
yeast is a more recent addition to the list .
not quite a beer binge in germany , beer has become more than just the national drink .
beer brewing is also a science students from around the world want to be schooled in .
while the eager scholars enjoy the beer tastings , the procedure resembles a scientific process more than oktoberfest bender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside a brewery " it 's a very full-taste , " said hiroshi yamashita , a japanese brewery student at the institute for brewing technology in weihenstephan , a city about 20 kilometers -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- north of munich .
" it 's a very typical german beer , the bitter flavor is stronger than japanese beer . "
employed by the asahi brewery , one of japan 's largest beer producers , yamashita is in a position to know all about japanese beer .
now he wants to find out what it is that has given german beer such a good reputation - something he ca n't do at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german beer enjoys a good reputation around the world " it was my dream to study in weihenstephan , " he said .
" in japan there are university programs to study the making of sake , but not beer brewing . "
though brewing can also be studied at berlin 's university of technology , bavaria 's reputation as the traditional german beer capital draws more people to the weihenstephan institute , part of munich 's university of technology .
" it 's a fact that tradition plays a large role in weihenstephan , " said werner back , a weihenstephan brewing technology professor . " the bavarian state brewery brewed beer here for the first time in 1040 . "
brewing tradition fascinates students it was the almost 1,000 years of brewing tradition that convinced texan ben bailey to struggle through five extra years of german lessons so he could be accepted into weihenstephan 's ranks . " i could go to any brewery in the usa and say that i studied in weihenstephan and they would know what i can do , " he said .
" at the university of california davis you can take a few brewery seminars , but there is no complete program and here everything is concentrated on brewery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever color it comes it , " real " german beer only has four ingredients studying the composition of german beer is becoming more and more popular .
more than 100 of the program 's 250 students started this year , about 15 percent of them coming from abroad .
the program is n't just about sipping foam leading many potential beer connoisseurs to drop out - there are no figures showing whether this is due to the coursework or perpetual hangovers .
while many students go on to ground their own breweries , others also work in the food or pharmaceutical industries .
fei qian , one of the students working his way through the institute 's theoretical and practical portions , has developed a special relationship to germany 's amber potion .
" once you 've drunk a beer in germany , you can develop a certain love for it , " the chinese student said .
" and weihenstephan is the mecca of beer . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dry spell for german beer dr. oetker became germany 's largest beer brewer through acquisitions in 2004 .
now the group known for pizza and pudding plans to shut down the 130-year-old berliner kindl brewery as well as dortmund 's brinkhoff brewery .

the british papers that attacked the pope need to see that they have brought the contempt of the whole world on themselves .
they are not only hated at home in england but everywhere in the world among fair minded decent people . - charles reichert , canada it is sad and unfair of british newspapers to attack the new pope , benedict xvi .
i , as a catholic , am deeply distressed because of this . - maria stec , us and poland yes , i think that it was in typical british style that the pope was indeed libeled and slandered .
i think he deserves an apology in just as bold a print .
moreover , i think the british prime minister should stand up and denounce this sort of journalism . - john breaux yes , the british newspapers are not only unfair with their treatment of our new pope , but they are also displaying their normal behavior about anything non-british .
they will probably end up giving a left-handed apology by saying that they " were just joshing . "
their humor even stinks ! - terry cummings the british press was not at all unfair to examine the past of pope benedict .
one 's life is formed by one 's past experiences .
the fact that the new pope served time in the hitler youth as a teenager is significant .
this is not to say one should not be allowed to move beyond one 's past though .
you have to remember the new pope is a mere mortal .
a pope is not capable of granting salvation and can not , therefore , be expected to be perfect .
our only possible means of salvation can be found in jesus christ . - jeff n. , us it is just so annoying and unbelievable - can all the media just please give the pope a chance ?
it 's just so unfair .
i am tired of everyone trying to find dirt on the pope .
why do n't they let us know more interesting things about all that he has done ?
and just let him show us what a great successor of the great john paul ii he can be ? - ximena lara , mexico german newspapers should get angry at rupert murdoch and not the british people since he owns and closely rules the editorial stance of all .
even though he is supposed to be a catholic , he is a nasty one . - jj hubbard the sun and mirror headlines are not reflected in the actual coverage .
they give a balanced view of his theological stance as has , for example , the daily telegraph .
they also give a fair account of his position during the nazi period .
actually the headlines are " friendly jocular " in a typically british way .
another paper prefers to describe him as a german shepherd .
another has a cartoon of him shouting from his balcony ordering his swiss guards and staff to get into proper straight lines . - jack rice i think that when one considers what the mirror and sun had to say about the new pope , one must consider the source .
they are tabloid rags who live only to sensationalize to sell papers .
was the pope a member of the hitler youth ?
yes , but honestly during that period did anyone have a choice ?
was the new pope forthcoming about his past ?
yes .
i think that this simple act of recognizing and admitting the error made in the past and atoning for it speaks more about the man then his past . - paul watson , canada i think calling the english journalists " idiots " is not proper by the german bild editors .
however , to portray the pope as being a hitler sympathizing person is quite outrageous and shameful .
to suggest that a person at the tender age of 14 could make a political statement of joining a hitler organization is beyond comprehension .
the english newspapers should get their act together and move on . - manfred zapka , us i think it very unfair to dredge up the past of someone who has since proven that he was an unwilling nazi youth .
we all are striving to better ourselves and improve .
anyone with half intelligence can go to the library and read about the era and draw the conclusion that hitler did not give very many people a choice .

i think the issue now is not what was done way back then but how we learn from history and not repeat the tragedies and failures .
we can not afford to throw stones and judge people by their past alone . - jennifer hurlock , us i think it is only expected that the secular media would demonize benedict xvi , a non-progressive pope .

their goal : to be considered a normal part of society . to be a jew in germany in recent history meant belonging to one of the country 's smallest minorities . the community shrunk drastically from its pre-holocaust number of 500,000 to the few thousand that stayed on after the world war ii or came back .
but german reunification , and generous immigration laws that granted citizenship to russian jews , have swelled the community to more than 120,000 nowadays . with the change in numbers has come a massive shift within the jewish community from one that was western european to one in which the dominant language is russian .

the association allows goos , who is careful to include both jews and non-jews in her circle of friends , to take some of the mystique away from being jewish .

the offences were committed during argentina 's " dirty war " - the period of military rule between 1976 and 1983 .
jorge luis magnacco falsified the birth certificate of a baby born to a mother held in the centre , the court said .
the verdict said he had participated in the government 's plan of systematically eliminating left-wing opponents .
" it was n't enough for them to root out those who were considered a risk to the regime 's ideals ... but they also eradicated those who in the future could harbour the same beliefs , " it said .
the adoptive mother and father of the child were also handed prison sentences by the court for adopting the child illegally .
the man , who worked for the air force , was given a seven-and-a-half year sentence and the woman a term of three years and one month .
blindfolded as many as 30,000 people are believed to have been killed or forcibly disappeared during the seven years of military rule , although the official figure is closer to 13,000 .
around 5,000 are believed to have been held at the navy school of mechanics , a torture centre in the capital , buenos aires known as esma .
human rights groups say that at esma female prisoners were forced , sometimes blindfolded , to give birth to their children in dirty cells .
they say that an estimated 400 children were either murdered or given up for adoption illegally .

by paul wade a partner in law firm simpson and marwick " those who advocate reform and strengthening of corporate killing laws - and it is hard to find anyone who does not - presumably have the objectives of reducing the incidence of fatal work-related accidents and , when they do occur , of punishing the " guilty " .
the publication by the home office of the corporate manslaughter bill for england and wales , eight years after the original manifesto commitment , has been hailed as a milestone .
the decision by the scottish executive to consult with a " panel of experts " before considering equivalent scottish legislation has been branded an unnecessary delay .
the english bill is a very watered down version of what was originally proposed .
it is aimed exclusively at " non natural " persons - virtually every form of legal person , except real people .
if implemented , it will have no sanction against individuals - only the organisations for which they work .
no individual will , as a result of these proposals , be censured , fined or sent to prison .
inward investment the original proposal , published by the home office in 2000 , to make directors and senior officers personally responsible and to make them liable to long terms of imprisonment if convicted has been abandoned .
in this respect there is no realistic prospect that any scottish reform will be different - the consequences for inward investment would be too great .
what then of the proposal to make companies and other organisations responsible for corporate killing ?
how will such an offence reduce the incidence of fatal accidents and , when they occur , punish the guilty ?
the english bill provides that the sanction for conviction is an unlimited fine .
companies and many organisations are already subject to the health and safety at work act 1974 and related legislation which imposes upon them vast numbers of statutory duties , breach of which is a criminal offence , whether the breach results in an accident or not .
the penalty for a breach of any of these provisions is ... an unlimited fine .
when passing sentence in hse prosecutions now courts can and do take into account the consequences of the breach , especially where the consequences include a serious injury or fatality .
so , the penalties are to be the same as under existing legislation .
but will the stigma associated with a conviction for corporate killing be a deterrent ?
a conviction for corporate killing might count against a company engaged in a competitive tendering process .
however , the majority of work-related fatal accidents occur as a result of the activities of relatively small organisations .
many such organisations cease to trade after a serious accident .
' shell ' company others can and do change their corporate identity quite regularly and readily in any event for organisational or fiscal reasons .
it will not be difficult -lrb- and there is nothing in the proposals to prevent it -rrb- for a small or even medium sized company , were it faced with the possibility of a corporate killing charge , to re-organise itself so that the organisation which ultimately faces the charge is a " shell " company with no continuing connection with the business or those who were running it , with no money to pay the fine and with a changed name .
for practical purposes a conviction under the proposals contained in the english bill will be avoidable by most small or medium-sized companies .
but what of larger organisations ?
they will not find it so easy to change their corporate identity . "
the proposals contained in the english bill do not even purport to raise standards " paul wade in the case of such organisations the evidence required to be adduced by the prosecution is likely to be complex .
it is going to involve identifying " senior managers " and showing that the way they organised its activities amounted to a " gross " breach of duty .
it is almost inevitable that by the time any such case reaches the court there will have been significant changes in the senior management of the organisation and probably its ownership in terms of shareholders .
the court would then be convicting an organisation which was only in a technical sense the same organisation as committed the crime .
surely the provisions will prevent some fatal accidents occurring by raising standards ?
but in his introduction to the corporate manslaughter bill , the home secretary said : " this is not about new standards .
raise standards " it is not my intention to propose legislation that would increase regulatory burdens , stifle entrepreneurial activity or create a risk averse culture and i am satisfied that these proposals do not . "
the proposals contained in the english bill do not therefore even purport to raise standards .
the proposals will not apply to the overwhelming majority of those culpably responsible for serious accidents -lrb- individuals -rrb- and be avoidable by most of the rest -lrb- small or medium sized companies -rrb- .
so much for the intended consequences , but what of the unintended consequences ?
the organisations susceptible to such a charge - mainly big companies and public authorities - will mainly want to avoid the possibility of conviction should a tragedy occur .
the chances are they will do that , not by raising safety standards but by internal reorganisation , seeking to create paper trails effectively establishing safety responsibilities at low managerial levels to prevent any failures being attributed to " senior managers " .
when a fatal accident occurs and a prosecution is considered , the prosecuting authorities will require to devote significant resources into investigating issues which go far beyond the scope of any current hse prosecution - not just identifying the cause of the accident and the responsibility for it but investigating the internal workings of the accused organisation and attributing the occurrence of the accident to gross breach of duty by ' senior managers ' .
the police , hse and prosecution authorities do not currently have the resources to carry out such investigations without neglecting other work .
the scottish executive are right to hesitate before putting forward any proposals . "

by paul wade a partner in law firm simpson and marwick paul wade believes the scottish executive is right to hesitate those who advocate reform and strengthening of corporate killing laws - and it is hard to find anyone who does not - presumably have the objectives of reducing the incidence of fatal work-related accidents and , when they do occur , of punishing the " guilty " .
the publication by the home office of the corporate manslaughter bill for england and wales , eight years after the original manifesto commitment , has been hailed as a milestone .
the decision by the scottish executive to consult with a " panel of experts " before considering equivalent scottish legislation has been branded an unnecessary delay .
the english bill is a very watered down version of what was originally proposed .
it is aimed exclusively at " non natural " persons - virtually every form of legal person , except real people .
if implemented , it will have no sanction against individuals - only the organisations for which they work .
no individual will , as a result of these proposals , be censured , fined or sent to prison .
inward investment the original proposal , published by the home office in 2000 , to make directors and senior officers personally responsible and to make them liable to long terms of imprisonment if convicted has been abandoned .
in this respect there is no realistic prospect that any scottish reform will be different - the consequences for inward investment would be too great .
what then of the proposal to make companies and other organisations responsible for corporate killing ?
how will such an offence reduce the incidence of fatal accidents and , when they occur , punish the guilty ?
the english bill provides that the sanction for conviction is an unlimited fine .
firms may take steps to ensure that senior managers do not face court companies and many organisations are already subject to the health and safety at work act 1974 and related legislation which imposes upon them vast numbers of statutory duties , breach of which is a criminal offence , whether the breach results in an accident or not .
the penalty for a breach of any of these provisions is ... an unlimited fine .
when passing sentence in hse prosecutions now courts can and do take into account the consequences of the breach , especially where the consequences include a serious injury or fatality .
so , the penalties are to be the same as under existing legislation .
but will the stigma associated with a conviction for corporate killing be a deterrent ?
a conviction for corporate killing might count against a company engaged in a competitive tendering process .
however , the majority of work-related fatal accidents occur as a result of the activities of relatively small organisations .
many such organisations cease to trade after a serious accident .
' shell ' company others can and do change their corporate identity quite regularly and readily in any event for organisational or fiscal reasons .
it will not be difficult -lrb- and there is nothing in the proposals to prevent it -rrb- for a small or even medium sized company , were it faced with the possibility of a corporate killing charge , to re-organise itself so that the organisation which ultimately faces the charge is a " shell " company with no continuing connection with the business or those who were running it , with no money to pay the fine and with a changed name .
for practical purposes a conviction under the proposals contained in the english bill will be avoidable by most small or medium-sized companies .
but what of larger organisations ?
they will not find it so easy to change their corporate identity .
the proposals contained in the english bill do not even purport to raise standards paul wade in the case of such organisations the evidence required to be adduced by the prosecution is likely to be complex .
it is going to involve identifying " senior managers " and showing that the way they organised its activities amounted to a " gross " breach of duty .
it is almost inevitable that by the time any such case reaches the court there will have been significant changes in the senior management of the organisation and probably its ownership in terms of shareholders .
the court would then be convicting an organisation which was only in a technical sense the same organisation as committed the crime .
surely the provisions will prevent some fatal accidents occurring by raising standards ?
but in his introduction to the corporate manslaughter bill , the home secretary said : " this is not about new standards .
raise standards " it is not my intention to propose legislation that would increase regulatory burdens , stifle entrepreneurial activity or create a risk averse culture and i am satisfied that these proposals do not . "
the proposals contained in the english bill do not therefore even purport to raise standards .
the proposals will not apply to the overwhelming majority of those culpably responsible for serious accidents -lrb- individuals -rrb- and be avoidable by most of the rest -lrb- small or medium sized companies -rrb- .
so much for the intended consequences , but what of the unintended consequences ?
the home office first published its proposals in 2000 the organisations susceptible to such a charge - mainly big companies and public authorities - will mainly want to avoid the possibility of conviction should a tragedy occur .
the chances are they will do that , not by raising safety standards but by internal reorganisation , seeking to create paper trails effectively establishing safety responsibilities at low managerial levels to prevent any failures being attributed to " senior managers " .
when a fatal accident occurs and a prosecution is considered , the prosecuting authorities will require to devote significant resources into investigating issues which go far beyond the scope of any current hse prosecution - not just identifying the cause of the accident and the responsibility for it but investigating the internal workings of the accused organisation and attributing the occurrence of the accident to gross breach of duty by ' senior managers ' .
the police , hse and prosecution authorities do not currently have the resources to carry out such investigations without neglecting other work .
the scottish executive are right to hesitate before putting forward any proposals .

he finds the country has undergone some changes since he lived here last .
until i was 18 years old , i had never met a black man or woman .
nor , knowingly at least , a jew nor a muslim .
i was a farm boy born and brought up in lincolnshire - among the whitest of white english counties .
i remember the stir in my primary school when a family of vietnamese refugees was housed in toynton all saints .
we stared and we prodded and we mimicked because these were people with whom we could make no meaningful connection .
they might as well have come from mars .
they were not threatening , they were not aggressive , but to us they were overwhelmingly weird .
for the past 15 years i have been living far away from my homeland - in cairo , jerusalem , washington and brussels .
and while i have been gone i know that things have changed .
new identities even my remote corner of eastern england has been penetrated by the world beyond .
the potato fields where my brother and i spent school holidays grubbing for spuds in exchange for shillings are now trodden by romanians and poles .
the gang masters , who in my childhood hired local women eager for bingo money , now draw from a deep well of immigrant labour .
in boston , the market town where i used to spend my hard-earned cash , you might hear lithuanian , albanian or mandarin during a stroll down the high street .
so the britain i am returning to is a different place , and i am a different man .
in the course of my life as a foreign correspondent i married a woman from iraq .
we have three children who see themselves as british - though they have never lived in britain - but as arab too .
i wonder where my family fits in the currently hot political debate about identity , belonging and britishness ?
are we immigrants ?
if so , does that mean we 're some sort of a problem ?
bridging chasms more than a dozen years ago , when i got married , my parents had to deal with a son who had strayed very far from the usual assumptions about racial continuity .
i suspect first news of my match left them with mixed emotions -lrb- though only the positive ones were transmitted to me -rrb- . "
my children are asking a simple question : ' will we like england ? " '
probably they still worry about the difficulties their grandchildren might face .
nonetheless the memory of my yorkshire grandmother , a woman now in her 90s , swaying to the rhythm of an egyptian dance band at our wedding party suggests the widest cultural chasms can be bridged .
and the truth is , the longer i have lived outside my own overcrowded , argumentative and increasingly fragmented homeland the more i have come to appreciate its ability to accept , to adapt .
slavery legacy for five years i lived in washington dc , capital of the land of the free , but arguably one of the most racially segregated cities on earth .
it is a majority black city .
it has a black mayor .
but spend time in the north-west quadrant of the city where the politicians , the lobbyists and the media folk live , and you 'll see nary a black or brown face .
except for the servants that is . "
it is hard not to conclude that continental europe is often less honest about its race problems than we are in britain " america 's first generation of african immigrants were forced across the atlantic in chains , and slavery 's legacy is a wound that is still very raw , visible right across america 's urban landscape .
my feeling is that britain 's big cities , for all the talk of gang violence and racial tension , are different .
in london , birmingham , manchester there is no absolute separation of the white middle class from the minorities on the other side of the tracks .
decades , centuries , of voluntary migration have created a patchwork where lines are increasingly blurred .
and that surely is an asset we should foster and cherish .
tensions in more recent years , i have been living just across the channel in liberal , self-consciously tolerant northern europe .
but when you look hard at the netherlands , with its growing muslim population , or france where the principles of liberte , egalite and fraternite are being sorely tested by racial and religious tension , it is hard not to conclude that continental europe is often less honest about its race problems , and is more frightened - of islam in particular - than we are in britain .
monkey chants directed at black players died on the lips of even the most bigoted english football supporters years ago ; in spain the grunting goes on .
over the last decade and a half , i have met many people - from slovakia to iraq and to afghanistan - whose dream has been to make a life for themselves and their families in the united kingdom .
most will never make it .
we sackurs , on the other hand , are enormously privileged .
we will cross the channel at our leisure and be welcomed home .
my three children are asking a simple question : " will we like england ? "
after 15 years away , the only truthful answer is : " i do n't know , but i fervently hope we will . "
last week stephen recalled his past assignments and the excitement of a correspondent 's job .

he finds the country has undergone some changes since he lived here last .
stephen is the new presenter of the bbc 's hardtalk programme until i was 18 years old , i had never met a black man or woman .
nor , knowingly at least , a jew nor a muslim .
i was a farm boy born and brought up in lincolnshire - among the whitest of white english counties .
i remember the stir in my primary school when a family of vietnamese refugees was housed in toynton all saints .
we stared and we prodded and we mimicked because these were people with whom we could make no meaningful connection .
they might as well have come from mars .
they were not threatening , they were not aggressive , but to us they were overwhelmingly weird .
for the past 15 years i have been living far away from my homeland - in cairo , jerusalem , washington and brussels .
and while i have been gone i know that things have changed .
new identities even my remote corner of eastern england has been penetrated by the world beyond .
the potato fields where my brother and i spent school holidays grubbing for spuds in exchange for shillings are now trodden by romanians and poles .
the gang masters , who in my childhood hired local women eager for bingo money , now draw from a deep well of immigrant labour .
migrant workers living in britain 's boston have faced intimidation in boston , the market town where i used to spend my hard-earned cash , you might hear lithuanian , albanian or mandarin during a stroll down the high street .
so the britain i am returning to is a different place , and i am a different man .
in the course of my life as a foreign correspondent i married a woman from iraq .
we have three children who see themselves as british - though they have never lived in britain - but as arab too .
i wonder where my family fits in the currently hot political debate about identity , belonging and britishness ?
are we immigrants ?
if so , does that mean we 're some sort of a problem ?
bridging chasms more than a dozen years ago , when i got married , my parents had to deal with a son who had strayed very far from the usual assumptions about racial continuity .
i suspect first news of my match left them with mixed emotions -lrb- though only the positive ones were transmitted to me -rrb- .
my children are asking a simple question : ' will we like england ? '
probably they still worry about the difficulties their grandchildren might face .
nonetheless the memory of my yorkshire grandmother , a woman now in her 90s , swaying to the rhythm of an egyptian dance band at our wedding party suggests the widest cultural chasms can be bridged .
and the truth is , the longer i have lived outside my own overcrowded , argumentative and increasingly fragmented homeland the more i have come to appreciate its ability to accept , to adapt .
slavery legacy for five years i lived in washington dc , capital of the land of the free , but arguably one of the most racially segregated cities on earth .
it is a majority black city .
it has a black mayor .
but spend time in the north-west quadrant of the city where the politicians , the lobbyists and the media folk live , and you 'll see nary a black or brown face .
except for the servants that is .
it is hard not to conclude that continental europe is often less honest about its race problems than we are in britain america 's first generation of african immigrants were forced across the atlantic in chains , and slavery 's legacy is a wound that is still very raw , visible right across america 's urban landscape .
my feeling is that britain 's big cities , for all the talk of gang violence and racial tension , are different .
in london , birmingham , manchester there is no absolute separation of the white middle class from the minorities on the other side of the tracks .
decades , centuries , of voluntary migration have created a patchwork where lines are increasingly blurred .
and that surely is an asset we should foster and cherish .
tensions in more recent years , i have been living just across the channel in liberal , self-consciously tolerant northern europe .
but when you look hard at the netherlands , with its growing muslim population , or france where the principles of liberte , egalite and fraternite are being sorely tested by racial and religious tension , it is hard not to conclude that continental europe is often less honest about its race problems , and is more frightened - of islam in particular - than we are in britain .
monkey chants directed at black players died on the lips of even the most bigoted english football supporters years ago ; in spain the grunting goes on .
over the last decade and a half , i have met many people - from slovakia to iraq and to afghanistan - whose dream has been to make a life for themselves and their families in the united kingdom .
most will never make it .
we sackurs , on the other hand , are enormously privileged .
we will cross the channel at our leisure and be welcomed home .
my three children are asking a simple question : " will we like england ? "
after 15 years away , the only truthful answer is : " i do n't know , but i fervently hope we will . "
last week stephen recalled his past assignments and the excitement of a correspondent 's job .

the world 's media have been swarming all over the vatican since the death of john paul ii .
over the past month , we have seen some extraordinary sights in and around st peter 's square .
we witnessed the vigils for the dying pope , and marvelled at the millions who came to say farewell .
there was the solemn splendour of a papal funeral , and the excitement of the white smoke that greeted the election of his successor .
today , benedict xvi called us in , 4,000 of us , to thank us for our journalistic efforts .
lucky tourists the tension of the past weeks seemed to have evaporated .
no more police cordons and arguments about passes and access .
even the usually stern swiss guards were smiling .
we were ushered into a vast audience hall used by popes to greet pilgrims .
even with so many journalists present , the hall was only half full .
the vatican quietly allowed in groups of startled tourists , to fill up some of the vacant seats behind us .
they could n't believe their luck .
they were expecting a stroll around st peter 's square in the sunshine .
instead they got to see the pope .
" fortuna , fortuna , " said one couple from sicily , in disbelief : " we were so lucky ! "
it was a smart move by the vatican .
pilgrims , being less cynical than hardened journalists , could be relied on to cheer and clap in the right places .
in fact , the papal minders need not have worried .
the journalists were neatly attired for the occasion , with male correspondents wearing suits and ties .
and when the pope walked in , everyone stood and applauded , in many cases with real enthusiasm .
having been shown due respect , benedict xvi seemed prepared to forgive us for all those reports saying how many catholics were alarmed by his election .
' thanks for the coverage ' sitting on a papal throne that looked too big for his small frame , the pope pulled out his gold-rimmed reading glasses and proceeded to address us in italian , english , french and german .
" thanks to all of you , these historically important events have had worldwide coverage , " he said .
" i know how hard you have worked , far away from your homes and families , for long hours and in sometimes difficult conditions . "
the international media made a mental note to pass on the pope 's words to their editors .
i noticed that the pontiff was wearing the red leather slippers that i had seen a few days earlier in the window of the papal tailors .
at the end of the audience , which lasted about 15 minutes , benedict xvi rose to give us his blessing .
then with a friendly wave and the words " grazie , arrivederci ! " he left the stage .
this was not , by any stretch of the imagination , a press conference .
there was no opportunity for the media to ask any questions , polite or otherwise .
some journalists were disappointed that the pope 's remarks contained nothing of substance to give us a clue about the direction his papacy will take .
controlled papacy the style was also a little different from the audience for the press given by john paul ii , back in 1978 .
then , in a media melee , the new pope shook hands with reporters , and responded to their shouted questions .
today 's proceedings were more dignified and everything was firmly under control .
in fact , some people believe control may be the watchword for this papacy .
however , the way some british newspapers have reported the background of the pope - including his enforced membership of the hitler youth - has irritated the media in germany .
" it is so silly , but they do the same at every football match , " said one german tv journalist .
" they use the language of the war when we should be looking forward , not bringing up the past . "
following the media profiles , the new pope has surprised many people with his engaging manner , which is rather at odds with his image as a hard-line conservative .
on sunday , at his inaugural mass , he has the opportunity to win more hearts and minds .
