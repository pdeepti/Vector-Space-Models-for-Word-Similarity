but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.06.2005 a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo thanks god for the music a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop . it 's not often that the tel aviv opera house attracts this kind of audience .
but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ? " or " what do you believe in ? , " frankfurt-based band " glashaus " and dancehall reggae act " gentleman " from cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there 's nothing reactionary about this new brand of contemporary christian rock .
despite their evangelical message , these young musicians are firmly anti the religious establishment .

finance ministers of the g8 are holding a preparatory meeting in london on friday and saturday ahead of next month 's summit in gleneagles , scotland .
at the top of the agenda is debt relief for africa . heading into a two day meeting in london , the finance ministers of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , the world 's top eight industrial countries , find themselves facing one huge , almost unmanageable problem , namely debt relief for africa .
britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown would like to be able to present some kind of concrete result on saturday but there is a lot of ground that must be covered before the world 's poorest continent will be offered any kind of major debt assistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- and george w. bush said debt relief for africa is possible the announcement by us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair on tuesday that they were close to completing a proposal for an elimination of 100 percent of debt for the world 's poorest countries had a condition attached to it for africa 's leaders , namely there must be improvement in governance and corruption must be reduced .
as blair put it , the debt plan was not " a something-for-nothing deal . "
on the weekend , the finance ministers will unlikely sign any concrete deals , despite gordon brown 's determination to produce something .
" we wo n't have any results after the meeting on the weekend , " said one high-ranked german government official .
the g8 countries do all agree on providing more financial assistance for the world 's poorest countries but just how they should do it remains to be debated .
criticism from around the world the meeting of the g8 finance ministers is meant as preparation for the summit in gleneagles , scotland next month but the pressure from the international community to present a plan soon is increasing .
archbishop desmond tutu said on bbc radio that the " west must n't operate from a position of moral superiority . "
he pointed out the business scandals in the us and europe such as enron , worldcom and parmalat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob geldof organized the live aid concerts in london and philadelphia in 1985 irish rock star bob geldof lashed out at western governments , saying the calls to end corruption were a diversionary tactic .
" we do n't die of corruption .
they do because they are too poor to withstand the impact of a thief stealing their money - so it has to stop , " said the organizer of the live8 pop concerts that will take place immediately before the g8 summit .
another long-time aid friend of africa , irish rock star bono , met with eu commission president jose manuel barroso on thursday , and challenged eu leaders to forget national politics and open their wallets to boost development aid for africa .
what wo n't happen just how any final debt relief deal will look like is uncertain .
germany is skeptical of floating bonds on financial markets to increase development aid .
the us and japan oppose the idea .
also no longer on the bargaining table is the sale of international monetary fund gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids has also made development work in africa more difficult finally , the prospect of adding a surcharge to airline tickets to reduce the debt has fallen on deaf ears in the us and japan .
even in europe , the idea is not without controversy .
what the ministers supposedly have agreed upon is a $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.6 billion euros -rrb- package to finance immunizations .
just what else gordon brown will be able to show the world at the end of the two-day meeting with his colleagues remains to be seen . afp / dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair gets african aid pledge from bush us president george bush was to pledge $ 674 million in new aid for africa at a summit on tuesday with british leader tony blair .
but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few hundred people take part in a demonstration against welfare cuts in berlin monday , sept .
20 , 2004 .
and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .
made in germany it would be great if germans did n't have to tighten their belts and accept less generous benefits from the state , but the cold hard truth is that the country has lived above its means for years .
the whole situation is aggravated by the fact that most teutons are n't having enough children these days .
however , what 's key to realize is that these german problems are german made .
in recent months , there has been a tendency to look abroad for the cause of germany 's woes .
low-wage eastern europe and asia have been blamed for companies outsourcing german jobs .
and blood-thirsty yankee capitalists have become the bogeyman threatening germany 's precious social market economy by spreading a dangerous profit-maximization mentality .
do n't get me wrong - i 'm as concerned about the darker side of globalization as much as the next guy .
free trade and international competition should not lead to environmental and living standards of the lowest common denominator .
but reform-phobic , old school socialist recipes offered by the pds / wasg alliance are not the answer .
unfortunately , regardless of whether schröder or the conservative opposition wins the next election , the newly unified left-wingers will likely thrive in the next parliament .
freed from the burden of actually having to address the rather serious issues facing germany , gregor , oskar and friends can rage against either social democratic sell-outs or cutthroat christian democrats . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karl marx 's birthplace gets a makeover the karl marx house in trier has been renovated to include a new multimedia exhibition on the socialist thinker 's life and work .

" who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "

the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .

" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .

" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

their trial in absentia opened last year and has provoked strong emotions in italy .
the men , accused of aggravated homicide , are not even expected to attend the verdict , due on june 22 , officials at the military tribunal said .
but observers say they are unlikely to be extradited or to serve a sentence because of their advanced age . they stand trial over the killing of 560 people in the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema on august 12 , 1944 , a few days after the liberation of the nearby city of florence by british troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting was one of many in the region that occurred as german troops retreated to the so-called " gothic line " of defence that cut across italy from la spezia to the adriatic . buried evidence evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities - mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre - apparently stored in a filing cabinet found in a rome basement . ever since the " cabinet of shame " was found , prosecutors in la spezia have been fighting time to bring suspects to trial . " precise roles " prosecutor marco de paolis told the court in the port city of la spezia that there were " numerous elements " to prove the men , now living in germany , had " precise roles " in one of italy 's worst civilian massacres during world war ii . according to recent studies , the allied forces had initially wanted to try the nazi soldiers after the war , but the plans were shelved in 1947 .
by the late 1940s only a dozen court martial proceedings were closed . some of the few people who survived the massacre , most of whom were young children at the time , were present in the court on thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi war crimes trial opens in italy the trial of three former german ss officers , charged with killing 560 civilians in a 1944 massacre in northern italy , began at a military court in la spezia on tuesday .

" i am satisfied that there is the political will of the richest countries to move forward , " british finance minister gordon brown , who has spearheaded the initiative , said in a televised interview with bbc . " it 's debt interest payments that prevent many poor countries from investing in health and education and i believe we could have the biggest debt write off the world has seen , " he said ahead of the meeting , which is seen as a precursor to next month 's g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown earlier this year , brown launched the so-called " marshall plan for africa " aimed at wiping out multilateral debt for the poorest nations and doubling annual development aid to 100 billion dollars by 2015 . the will is there under the two-pronged plan , britain has set out to convince the world 's wealthiest countries to cancel the 80-billion dollar multilateral debts owed by poor countries to the international monetary fund , the world bank and the african development bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children look on in envy while the older of the three proudly shows a 20 rand bill -lrb- about 5,5 usd -rrb- in front of their house in kanyiso , south africa " there is a will to come to an agreement , " brown said .
the difficulty is trying to find common ground for writing off the debt and funding the loss of debt interest payments by the international institutions . at a meeting earlier this week in washington , british prime minister tony blair and us president george w. bush said they were close to completing their proposal for canceling 100 percent of debt for the world 's poorest countries . according to the new york times on friday , britain and the us have agreed on a system to relieve 18 of the poorest nations , mostly in africa , of combined debt worth 16.7 billion dollars -lrb- 13.66 billion euros -rrb- . germany doubts compromise a definite agreement among all g8 members , however , has not been reached , and according to german government officials , who have rejected a 100 percent debt write-off as unfeasible , the main sticking point is the method of financing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty and famine go hand-in-hand in much of africa unlike the us-british plan , germany , france and japan are expected to back debt relief for just five countries and have pegged the extent of cancellation to specific criteria such as " good government . "
the europeans have also called for a finance proposal based on taxing commercial aviation fuel – a plan the us is reluctant to support . when asked about the possibility of finding a compromise at the two-day london meeting , german deputy finance minister caio koch-weser said he " doubts " whether that would happen . " i doubt it , but i do not exclude it , " he said .
" we are working to bring our positions closer together , the german said in london . under the brown-inspired proposal , which has at least tentative approval from several countries , the imf could sell off a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed .
while the imf has acknowledged the feasibility of the sale , the us has objected , saying that offloading the reserves would destabilize the markets . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 finance ministers under pressure finance ministers of the g8 are holding a preparatory meeting in london on friday and saturday ahead of next month 's summit in gleneagles , scotland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.06.2005 robot cops for german stadiums ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ofro must n't sleep and can smell poisonous gases an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure , so the adage .
but 50 kilograms of high-tech machinery could be employed to protect the world cup next year by hindering potential terrorist attacks . " ofro + detect " is a modern-sounding name .
the device definitely has the imposing look of a military tank - in miniature .
at 1.20 meters -lrb- almost four feet -rrb- , visitors to next year 's world cup in germany will have to be sure not to step on the panzer .
yet with a hefty 50 kilograms -lrb- about 100 pounds -rrb- on top of its tank tracks , spectators would most likely come away with a few stubbed toes should they tread on ofro .
the berlin-based company robowatch technologies hopes that the modern technology they have to offer will find a place in the anti-terror watch during next year 's world cup in germany .
ofro can take over those dangerous , and tedious , duties that most security officers do not want to assume , namely checking for atomic , biological and chemical , or abc , weapons .
ofro can roam the stadiums 12 hours at a time , the whole time its sensors can trace any dangerous weapons of mass destruction that may have been emitted into the stadium .
business manager ulf stremmel thinks that ofro is a " suitable instrument in the war against terror . "
bildunterschrift : you do n't have to smile for this camera camera and gas sensors the use of the robots in almost all areas means almost 100 percent dependability .
ofro is no different .
it does not need any bothersome coffee breaks , is the epitome of concentration and does n't tire .
in the 12 hours of operation time , it can cover 10,000 square meters at a speed of five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- per hour .
the whole time it uses its thermal camera and sensors to detect possible terror hazards , according to the company 's chief developer , jens hanke .
the robot wirelessly transmits all the information that is gathered at a central location .
it also takes air samples and should there be irregularities , it sounds an alarm .
nothing can get in ofro 's way and it can steer through fan crowds all by itself .
waiting for its assignment the robowatch technologies management are still waiting to hear from security officials if ofro will actually be needed .
stremmel said that the robot 's presence could help in preparing countermeasures in the event of an attack .
naturally it can not replace humans fully but it could act as an important element in the area of security .
bildunterschrift : ofro wo n't emit any noxious gases the german interior ministry has yet to say whether they want to buy ofro for 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- or even just rent it for 3,500 euros per month .
one distinct advantage that ofro offers according to hanke is its integrity .
" our robots can be neither intimidated nor bribed , " he said .
but it could take valuable jobs away . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .

and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

he called on medium-sized companies not to miss their chance to secure a slice of the giant pie . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian finance minister p. chidambaram " just see what the koreans have done in the last ten years , " he said .
" if i was you , i 'd ask myself one simple question : if south korea can do it , why ca n't germany ?
if japan can do it , why ca n't germany ?
and today , if chinese companies can enter india , why not germany ? " by the same token , many indian companies have long been seen as global players striving to score a presence here in germany , either because their customers are here or because german technology is good for their image . germans not so rigid in 2004 , metal worker bharat forge from pune took over the 170 year-old metal component manufacturing company , carl dan peddinghaus .
now , under the name cdp bharat forge , he successfully supplies the european automobile industry from his base in germany . similarly , the largest private industrial company in india , reliance , has bought polyester manufacturer trevira , formerly a subsidiary of hoechst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers can see how their indian counterparts work at home it is still quite unusual for german companies to be run by indian management , but subodh sapra , chairman of the indian trevira supervisory board said the germans are more flexible than their reputation suggests . " they realize that as we are the world 's largest producer of polyester today , we can help them , " he said . " i could n't say that every single one of the 2000 employees we have in trevira open-minded , that of course is not true .
but by and large , we were welcomed and they are responding .
and we help them by taking them to india and showing them our operations . " communication success there are undoubtedly differences between the german and indian way of running a company , but on the whole , communication has been much easier than feared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrepreneurial indians are finding a face in germany " language was certainly a concern we had , but we were surprised how many people spoke english , and how many were willing to talk to us , " sapra said .
" maybe not in the best english , but so what ? " manager bernhard steinrücke said that german companies and indian management are a match made in heaven . " the indians are great believers in german technology , reliance and educational standards , " he said .

he called on medium-sized companies not to miss their chance to secure a slice of the giant pie . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian finance minister p. chidambaram " just see what the koreans have done in the last ten years , " he said .
" if i was you , i 'd ask myself one simple question : if south korea can do it , why ca n't germany ?
if japan can do it , why ca n't germany ?
and today , if chinese companies can enter india , why not germany ? " by the same token , many indian companies have long been seen as global players striving to score a presence here in germany , either because their customers are here or because german technology is good for their image . germans not so rigid in 2004 , metal worker bharat forge from pune took over the 170 year-old metal component manufacturing company , carl dan peddinghaus .
now , under the name cdp bharat forge , he successfully supplies the european automobile industry from his base in germany . similarly , the largest private industrial company in india , reliance , has bought polyester manufacturer trevira , formerly a subsidiary of hoechst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers can see how their indian counterparts work at home it is still quite unusual for german companies to be run by indian management , but subodh sapra , chairman of the indian trevira supervisory board said the germans are more flexible than their reputation suggests . " they realize that as we are the world 's largest producer of polyester today , we can help them , " he said . " i could n't say that every single one of the 2000 employees we have in trevira open-minded , that of course is not true .
but by and large , we were welcomed and they are responding .
and we help them by taking them to india and showing them our operations . " communication success there are undoubtedly differences between the german and indian way of running a company , but on the whole , communication has been much easier than feared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrepreneurial indians are finding a face in germany " language was certainly a concern we had , but we were surprised how many people spoke english , and how many were willing to talk to us , " sapra said .
" maybe not in the best english , but so what ? " manager bernhard steinrücke said that german companies and indian management are a match made in heaven . " the indians are great believers in german technology , reliance and educational standards , " he said .
" what we germans are lacking is motivation , or what i call the feel good factor .
the indians have it , they are relentlessly optimistic , which means they can achieve a lot here in our relentlessly pessimistic germany .

the berlin-based company robowatch technologies hopes that the modern technology they have to offer will find a place in the anti-terror watch during next year 's world cup in germany .
ofro can take over those dangerous , and tedious , duties that most security officers do not want to assume , namely checking for atomic , biological and chemical , or abc , weapons .

it also takes air samples and should there be irregularities , it sounds an alarm .
nothing can get in ofro 's way and it can steer through fan crowds all by itself .
waiting for its assignment the robowatch technologies management are still waiting to hear from security officials if ofro will actually be needed .
stremmel said that the robot 's presence could help in preparing countermeasures in the event of an attack .

but 50 kilograms of high-tech machinery could be employed to protect the world cup next year by hindering potential terrorist attacks . " ofro + detect " is a modern-sounding name .
the device definitely has the imposing look of a military tank - in miniature .
at 1.20 meters -lrb- almost four feet -rrb- , visitors to next year 's world cup in germany will have to be sure not to step on the panzer .
yet with a hefty 50 kilograms -lrb- about 100 pounds -rrb- on top of its tank tracks , spectators would most likely come away with a few stubbed toes should they tread on ofro .
the berlin-based company robowatch technologies hopes that the modern technology they have to offer will find a place in the anti-terror watch during next year 's world cup in germany .
ofro can take over those dangerous , and tedious , duties that most security officers do not want to assume , namely checking for atomic , biological and chemical , or abc , weapons .
ofro can roam the stadiums 12 hours at a time , the whole time its sensors can trace any dangerous weapons of mass destruction that may have been emitted into the stadium .
business manager ulf stremmel thinks that ofro is a " suitable instrument in the war against terror . "
bildunterschrift : you do n't have to smile for this camera camera and gas sensors the use of the robots in almost all areas means almost 100 percent dependability .
ofro is no different .
it does not need any bothersome coffee breaks , is the epitome of concentration and does n't tire .
in the 12 hours of operation time , it can cover 10,000 square meters at a speed of five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- per hour .
the whole time it uses its thermal camera and sensors to detect possible terror hazards , according to the company 's chief developer , jens hanke .
the robot wirelessly transmits all the information that is gathered at a central location .
it also takes air samples and should there be irregularities , it sounds an alarm .
nothing can get in ofro 's way and it can steer through fan crowds all by itself .
waiting for its assignment the robowatch technologies management are still waiting to hear from security officials if ofro will actually be needed .
stremmel said that the robot 's presence could help in preparing countermeasures in the event of an attack .
naturally it can not replace humans fully but it could act as an important element in the area of security .
bildunterschrift : ofro wo n't emit any noxious gases the german interior ministry has yet to say whether they want to buy ofro for 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- or even just rent it for 3,500 euros per month .
one distinct advantage that ofro offers according to hanke is its integrity .
" our robots can be neither intimidated nor bribed , " he said .
but it could take valuable jobs away . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made a joint appeal in paris on friday for the process of ratifying the eu constitution to continue despite referendum defeats in france and the netherlands and the suspension of a plebiscite in britain . the leaders of the two countries that have been the traditional motor behind eu integration emphasized the need for europe to pull together and set forth the democratic process it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders meet in paris to discuss the future of the eu constitution and budget talks chirac said member states must unite in the " difficult times " following the french and dutch rejection of the charter .

each eu member state " must make an effort " so that the bloc 's financial problems do not exacerbate the political ones revealed by the resistance to the eu constitution . but blair has refused to give way , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending , including a revision of costly eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers greatly benefit . france and germany 's forceful stance , and britain 's stubbornness to yield sets the scene for a dramatic summit of eu heads of state and government in brussels next thursday and friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made a joint appeal in paris on friday for the process of ratifying the eu constitution to continue despite referendum defeats in france and the netherlands and the suspension of a plebiscite in britain . the leaders of the two countries that have been the traditional motor behind eu integration emphasized the need for europe to pull together and set forth the democratic process it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders meet in paris to discuss the future of the eu constitution and budget talks chirac said member states must unite in the " difficult times " following the french and dutch rejection of the charter .
" we are in agreement in reaffirming how much the european union … needs above all to unite and to reflect , " the french president said . no premature conclusions speaking at a press conference alongside chirac , schröder said it would be " premature " to give up on the constitution , which was designed to make decision-making easier in the enlarged , 25-nation union .
the eu should wait until other countries have voted on the constitution before taking a decision on its future . " it 's too early to draw any preliminary conclusions .
i think we have to first wait for the upcoming referendums in denmark , portugal and luxembourg and other countries , " he told reporters , implying that eu leaders should hold off on taking a decision on the future of the constitution until at least their end-year summit . luxembourg is set to hold a referendum in july , denmark in september and portugal in october . eu crisis widens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac welcomes schröder at the elysee palace in paris , 10 june 2005 .
ahead of next week 's mid-year summit , discussion about the future of the eu threatened to take another downward spin after schröder and chirac joined forces to criticize great britain 's stance on the bloc 's budget .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made a joint appeal in paris on friday for the process of ratifying the eu constitution to continue despite referendum defeats in france and the netherlands and the suspension of a plebiscite in britain . the leaders of the two countries that have been the traditional motor behind eu integration emphasized the need for europe to pull together and set forth the democratic process it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders meet in paris to discuss the future of the eu constitution and budget talks chirac said member states must unite in the " difficult times " following the french and dutch rejection of the charter .
" we are in agreement in reaffirming how much the european union … needs above all to unite and to reflect , " the french president said . no premature conclusions speaking at a press conference alongside chirac , schröder said it would be " premature " to give up on the constitution , which was designed to make decision-making easier in the enlarged , 25-nation union .
the eu should wait until other countries have voted on the constitution before taking a decision on its future . " it 's too early to draw any preliminary conclusions .
i think we have to first wait for the upcoming referendums in denmark , portugal and luxembourg and other countries , " he told reporters , implying that eu leaders should hold off on taking a decision on the future of the constitution until at least their end-year summit . luxembourg is set to hold a referendum in july , denmark in september and portugal in october . eu crisis widens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac welcomes schröder at the elysee palace in paris , 10 june 2005 .
ahead of next week 's mid-year summit , discussion about the future of the eu threatened to take another downward spin after schröder and chirac joined forces to criticize great britain 's stance on the bloc 's budget .
the two leaders announced on friday they wanted britain to give up a hard-won five-billion-euro -lrb- six-billion-dollar -rrb- annual rebate it gets from the eu budget – something british prime minister tony blair has bluntly ruled out . " above all our british friends must recognize how things have changed and the need for greater equity in the financial charges that each country bears , " chirac said addressing plans to reorganize the bloc 's budget for 2007-2013 at next week 's summit . chirac said the eu rebate britain won in 1984 after tough negotiations with then-prime minister margaret thatcher was outdated .
each eu member state " must make an effort " so that the bloc 's financial problems do not exacerbate the political ones revealed by the resistance to the eu constitution . but blair has refused to give way , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending , including a revision of costly eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers greatly benefit . france and germany 's forceful stance , and britain 's stubbornness to yield sets the scene for a dramatic summit of eu heads of state and government in brussels next thursday and friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few hundred people take part in a demonstration against welfare cuts in berlin monday , sept .
20 , 2004 .
and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .
made in germany it would be great if germans did n't have to tighten their belts and accept less generous benefits from the state , but the cold hard truth is that the country has lived above its means for years .
the whole situation is aggravated by the fact that most teutons are n't having enough children these days .
however , what 's key to realize is that these german problems are german made .
in recent months , there has been a tendency to look abroad for the cause of germany 's woes .
low-wage eastern europe and asia have been blamed for companies outsourcing german jobs .
and blood-thirsty yankee capitalists have become the bogeyman threatening germany 's precious social market economy by spreading a dangerous profit-maximization mentality .
do n't get me wrong - i 'm as concerned about the darker side of globalization as much as the next guy .
free trade and international competition should not lead to environmental and living standards of the lowest common denominator .
but reform-phobic , old school socialist recipes offered by the pds / wasg alliance are not the answer .
unfortunately , regardless of whether schröder or the conservative opposition wins the next election , the newly unified left-wingers will likely thrive in the next parliament .
freed from the burden of actually having to address the rather serious issues facing germany , gregor , oskar and friends can rage against either social democratic sell-outs or cutthroat christian democrats . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karl marx 's birthplace gets a makeover the karl marx house in trier has been renovated to include a new multimedia exhibition on the socialist thinker 's life and work .

oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .

finance ministers of the g8 are holding a preparatory meeting in london on friday and saturday ahead of next month 's summit in gleneagles , scotland .
at the top of the agenda is debt relief for africa . heading into a two day meeting in london , the finance ministers of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , the world 's top eight industrial countries , find themselves facing one huge , almost unmanageable problem , namely debt relief for africa .
britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown would like to be able to present some kind of concrete result on saturday but there is a lot of ground that must be covered before the world 's poorest continent will be offered any kind of major debt assistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- and george w. bush said debt relief for africa is possible the announcement by us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair on tuesday that they were close to completing a proposal for an elimination of 100 percent of debt for the world 's poorest countries had a condition attached to it for africa 's leaders , namely there must be improvement in governance and corruption must be reduced .
as blair put it , the debt plan was not " a something-for-nothing deal . "
on the weekend , the finance ministers will unlikely sign any concrete deals , despite gordon brown 's determination to produce something .
" we wo n't have any results after the meeting on the weekend , " said one high-ranked german government official .
the g8 countries do all agree on providing more financial assistance for the world 's poorest countries but just how they should do it remains to be debated .
criticism from around the world the meeting of the g8 finance ministers is meant as preparation for the summit in gleneagles , scotland next month but the pressure from the international community to present a plan soon is increasing .
archbishop desmond tutu said on bbc radio that the " west must n't operate from a position of moral superiority . "
he pointed out the business scandals in the us and europe such as enron , worldcom and parmalat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob geldof organized the live aid concerts in london and philadelphia in 1985 irish rock star bob geldof lashed out at western governments , saying the calls to end corruption were a diversionary tactic .
" we do n't die of corruption .
they do because they are too poor to withstand the impact of a thief stealing their money - so it has to stop , " said the organizer of the live8 pop concerts that will take place immediately before the g8 summit .
another long-time aid friend of africa , irish rock star bono , met with eu commission president jose manuel barroso on thursday , and challenged eu leaders to forget national politics and open their wallets to boost development aid for africa .
what wo n't happen just how any final debt relief deal will look like is uncertain .
germany is skeptical of floating bonds on financial markets to increase development aid .
the us and japan oppose the idea .
also no longer on the bargaining table is the sale of international monetary fund gold reserves .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few hundred people take part in a demonstration against welfare cuts in berlin monday , sept .
20 , 2004 .
and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .
made in germany it would be great if germans did n't have to tighten their belts and accept less generous benefits from the state , but the cold hard truth is that the country has lived above its means for years .
the whole situation is aggravated by the fact that most teutons are n't having enough children these days .
however , what 's key to realize is that these german problems are german made .
in recent months , there has been a tendency to look abroad for the cause of germany 's woes .
low-wage eastern europe and asia have been blamed for companies outsourcing german jobs .
and blood-thirsty yankee capitalists have become the bogeyman threatening germany 's precious social market economy by spreading a dangerous profit-maximization mentality .
do n't get me wrong - i 'm as concerned about the darker side of globalization as much as the next guy .
free trade and international competition should not lead to environmental and living standards of the lowest common denominator .
but reform-phobic , old school socialist recipes offered by the pds / wasg alliance are not the answer .
unfortunately , regardless of whether schröder or the conservative opposition wins the next election , the newly unified left-wingers will likely thrive in the next parliament .
freed from the burden of actually having to address the rather serious issues facing germany , gregor , oskar and friends can rage against either social democratic sell-outs or cutthroat christian democrats . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karl marx 's birthplace gets a makeover the karl marx house in trier has been renovated to include a new multimedia exhibition on the socialist thinker 's life and work .

the robot wirelessly transmits all the information that is gathered at a central location .
it also takes air samples and should there be irregularities , it sounds an alarm .
nothing can get in ofro 's way and it can steer through fan crowds all by itself .
waiting for its assignment the robowatch technologies management are still waiting to hear from security officials if ofro will actually be needed .

" who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "

the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .

" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .

he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .

but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ? " or " what do you believe in ? , " frankfurt-based band " glashaus " and dancehall reggae act " gentleman " from cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there 's nothing reactionary about this new brand of contemporary christian rock .
despite their evangelical message , these young musicians are firmly anti the religious establishment .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.06.2005 a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo thanks god for the music a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop . it 's not often that the tel aviv opera house attracts this kind of audience .
but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ? " or " what do you believe in ? , " frankfurt-based band " glashaus " and dancehall reggae act " gentleman " from cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there 's nothing reactionary about this new brand of contemporary christian rock .
despite their evangelical message , these young musicians are firmly anti the religious establishment .

this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ? " or " what do you believe in ? , " frankfurt-based band " glashaus " and dancehall reggae act " gentleman " from cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there 's nothing reactionary about this new brand of contemporary christian rock .
despite their evangelical message , these young musicians are firmly anti the religious establishment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.06.2005 a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo thanks god for the music a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop . it 's not often that the tel aviv opera house attracts this kind of audience .
but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ? " or " what do you believe in ? , " frankfurt-based band " glashaus " and dancehall reggae act " gentleman " from cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there 's nothing reactionary about this new brand of contemporary christian rock .
despite their evangelical message , these young musicians are firmly anti the religious establishment .

he called on medium-sized companies not to miss their chance to secure a slice of the giant pie . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian finance minister p. chidambaram " just see what the koreans have done in the last ten years , " he said .
" if i was you , i 'd ask myself one simple question : if south korea can do it , why ca n't germany ?
if japan can do it , why ca n't germany ?
and today , if chinese companies can enter india , why not germany ? " by the same token , many indian companies have long been seen as global players striving to score a presence here in germany , either because their customers are here or because german technology is good for their image . germans not so rigid in 2004 , metal worker bharat forge from pune took over the 170 year-old metal component manufacturing company , carl dan peddinghaus .
now , under the name cdp bharat forge , he successfully supplies the european automobile industry from his base in germany . similarly , the largest private industrial company in india , reliance , has bought polyester manufacturer trevira , formerly a subsidiary of hoechst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers can see how their indian counterparts work at home it is still quite unusual for german companies to be run by indian management , but subodh sapra , chairman of the indian trevira supervisory board said the germans are more flexible than their reputation suggests . " they realize that as we are the world 's largest producer of polyester today , we can help them , " he said .

the difficulty is trying to find common ground for writing off the debt and funding the loss of debt interest payments by the international institutions . at a meeting earlier this week in washington , british prime minister tony blair and us president george w. bush said they were close to completing their proposal for canceling 100 percent of debt for the world 's poorest countries . according to the new york times on friday , britain and the us have agreed on a system to relieve 18 of the poorest nations , mostly in africa , of combined debt worth 16.7 billion dollars -lrb- 13.66 billion euros -rrb- . germany doubts compromise a definite agreement among all g8 members , however , has not been reached , and according to german government officials , who have rejected a 100 percent debt write-off as unfeasible , the main sticking point is the method of financing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty and famine go hand-in-hand in much of africa unlike the us-british plan , germany , france and japan are expected to back debt relief for just five countries and have pegged the extent of cancellation to specific criteria such as " good government . "
the europeans have also called for a finance proposal based on taxing commercial aviation fuel – a plan the us is reluctant to support . when asked about the possibility of finding a compromise at the two-day london meeting , german deputy finance minister caio koch-weser said he " doubts " whether that would happen . " i doubt it , but i do not exclude it , " he said .
" we are working to bring our positions closer together , the german said in london . under the brown-inspired proposal , which has at least tentative approval from several countries , the imf could sell off a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed .
while the imf has acknowledged the feasibility of the sale , the us has objected , saying that offloading the reserves would destabilize the markets . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 finance ministers under pressure finance ministers of the g8 are holding a preparatory meeting in london on friday and saturday ahead of next month 's summit in gleneagles , scotland .

at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made a joint appeal in paris on friday for the process of ratifying the eu constitution to continue despite referendum defeats in france and the netherlands and the suspension of a plebiscite in britain . the leaders of the two countries that have been the traditional motor behind eu integration emphasized the need for europe to pull together and set forth the democratic process it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders meet in paris to discuss the future of the eu constitution and budget talks chirac said member states must unite in the " difficult times " following the french and dutch rejection of the charter .
" we are in agreement in reaffirming how much the european union … needs above all to unite and to reflect , " the french president said . no premature conclusions speaking at a press conference alongside chirac , schröder said it would be " premature " to give up on the constitution , which was designed to make decision-making easier in the enlarged , 25-nation union .
the eu should wait until other countries have voted on the constitution before taking a decision on its future . " it 's too early to draw any preliminary conclusions .

ahead of next week 's mid-year summit , discussion about the future of the eu threatened to take another downward spin after schröder and chirac joined forces to criticize great britain 's stance on the bloc 's budget .
the two leaders announced on friday they wanted britain to give up a hard-won five-billion-euro -lrb- six-billion-dollar -rrb- annual rebate it gets from the eu budget – something british prime minister tony blair has bluntly ruled out . " above all our british friends must recognize how things have changed and the need for greater equity in the financial charges that each country bears , " chirac said addressing plans to reorganize the bloc 's budget for 2007-2013 at next week 's summit . chirac said the eu rebate britain won in 1984 after tough negotiations with then-prime minister margaret thatcher was outdated .
each eu member state " must make an effort " so that the bloc 's financial problems do not exacerbate the political ones revealed by the resistance to the eu constitution . but blair has refused to give way , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending , including a revision of costly eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers greatly benefit . france and germany 's forceful stance , and britain 's stubbornness to yield sets the scene for a dramatic summit of eu heads of state and government in brussels next thursday and friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .

the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .

the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2005 nazi massacre trial reopens old wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily -lrb- center -rrb- honored the victims in 2004 a prosecutor on thursday demanded life imprisonment for 10 former nazi german soldiers , now in their 80s , who are on trial for the wartime nazi massacre of 560 civilians in an italian mountain village . marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life , in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . none of the defendants were present in the courtroom .
their trial in absentia opened last year and has provoked strong emotions in italy .
the men , accused of aggravated homicide , are not even expected to attend the verdict , due on june 22 , officials at the military tribunal said .

he called on medium-sized companies not to miss their chance to secure a slice of the giant pie . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian finance minister p. chidambaram " just see what the koreans have done in the last ten years , " he said .
" if i was you , i 'd ask myself one simple question : if south korea can do it , why ca n't germany ?
if japan can do it , why ca n't germany ?
and today , if chinese companies can enter india , why not germany ? " by the same token , many indian companies have long been seen as global players striving to score a presence here in germany , either because their customers are here or because german technology is good for their image . germans not so rigid in 2004 , metal worker bharat forge from pune took over the 170 year-old metal component manufacturing company , carl dan peddinghaus .
now , under the name cdp bharat forge , he successfully supplies the european automobile industry from his base in germany . similarly , the largest private industrial company in india , reliance , has bought polyester manufacturer trevira , formerly a subsidiary of hoechst . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german workers can see how their indian counterparts work at home it is still quite unusual for german companies to be run by indian management , but subodh sapra , chairman of the indian trevira supervisory board said the germans are more flexible than their reputation suggests . " they realize that as we are the world 's largest producer of polyester today , we can help them , " he said . " i could n't say that every single one of the 2000 employees we have in trevira open-minded , that of course is not true .
but by and large , we were welcomed and they are responding .
and we help them by taking them to india and showing them our operations . " communication success there are undoubtedly differences between the german and indian way of running a company , but on the whole , communication has been much easier than feared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entrepreneurial indians are finding a face in germany " language was certainly a concern we had , but we were surprised how many people spoke english , and how many were willing to talk to us , " sapra said .
" maybe not in the best english , but so what ? " manager bernhard steinrücke said that german companies and indian management are a match made in heaven . " the indians are great believers in german technology , reliance and educational standards , " he said .
" what we germans are lacking is motivation , or what i call the feel good factor .
the indians have it , they are relentlessly optimistic , which means they can achieve a lot here in our relentlessly pessimistic germany .

the berlin-based company robowatch technologies hopes that the modern technology they have to offer will find a place in the anti-terror watch during next year 's world cup in germany .
ofro can take over those dangerous , and tedious , duties that most security officers do not want to assume , namely checking for atomic , biological and chemical , or abc , weapons .

it also takes air samples and should there be irregularities , it sounds an alarm .
nothing can get in ofro 's way and it can steer through fan crowds all by itself .
waiting for its assignment the robowatch technologies management are still waiting to hear from security officials if ofro will actually be needed .
stremmel said that the robot 's presence could help in preparing countermeasures in the event of an attack .

but 50 kilograms of high-tech machinery could be employed to protect the world cup next year by hindering potential terrorist attacks . " ofro + detect " is a modern-sounding name .
the device definitely has the imposing look of a military tank - in miniature .
at 1.20 meters -lrb- almost four feet -rrb- , visitors to next year 's world cup in germany will have to be sure not to step on the panzer .
yet with a hefty 50 kilograms -lrb- about 100 pounds -rrb- on top of its tank tracks , spectators would most likely come away with a few stubbed toes should they tread on ofro .
the berlin-based company robowatch technologies hopes that the modern technology they have to offer will find a place in the anti-terror watch during next year 's world cup in germany .
ofro can take over those dangerous , and tedious , duties that most security officers do not want to assume , namely checking for atomic , biological and chemical , or abc , weapons .
ofro can roam the stadiums 12 hours at a time , the whole time its sensors can trace any dangerous weapons of mass destruction that may have been emitted into the stadium .
business manager ulf stremmel thinks that ofro is a " suitable instrument in the war against terror . "
bildunterschrift : you do n't have to smile for this camera camera and gas sensors the use of the robots in almost all areas means almost 100 percent dependability .
ofro is no different .
it does not need any bothersome coffee breaks , is the epitome of concentration and does n't tire .
in the 12 hours of operation time , it can cover 10,000 square meters at a speed of five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- per hour .
the whole time it uses its thermal camera and sensors to detect possible terror hazards , according to the company 's chief developer , jens hanke .
the robot wirelessly transmits all the information that is gathered at a central location .
it also takes air samples and should there be irregularities , it sounds an alarm .
nothing can get in ofro 's way and it can steer through fan crowds all by itself .
waiting for its assignment the robowatch technologies management are still waiting to hear from security officials if ofro will actually be needed .
stremmel said that the robot 's presence could help in preparing countermeasures in the event of an attack .
naturally it can not replace humans fully but it could act as an important element in the area of security .
bildunterschrift : ofro wo n't emit any noxious gases the german interior ministry has yet to say whether they want to buy ofro for 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- or even just rent it for 3,500 euros per month .
one distinct advantage that ofro offers according to hanke is its integrity .
" our robots can be neither intimidated nor bribed , " he said .
but it could take valuable jobs away . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

finance ministers of the g8 are holding a preparatory meeting in london on friday and saturday ahead of next month 's summit in gleneagles , scotland .
at the top of the agenda is debt relief for africa . heading into a two day meeting in london , the finance ministers of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , the world 's top eight industrial countries , find themselves facing one huge , almost unmanageable problem , namely debt relief for africa .
britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown would like to be able to present some kind of concrete result on saturday but there is a lot of ground that must be covered before the world 's poorest continent will be offered any kind of major debt assistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- and george w. bush said debt relief for africa is possible the announcement by us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair on tuesday that they were close to completing a proposal for an elimination of 100 percent of debt for the world 's poorest countries had a condition attached to it for africa 's leaders , namely there must be improvement in governance and corruption must be reduced .
as blair put it , the debt plan was not " a something-for-nothing deal . "
on the weekend , the finance ministers will unlikely sign any concrete deals , despite gordon brown 's determination to produce something .
" we wo n't have any results after the meeting on the weekend , " said one high-ranked german government official .
the g8 countries do all agree on providing more financial assistance for the world 's poorest countries but just how they should do it remains to be debated .
criticism from around the world the meeting of the g8 finance ministers is meant as preparation for the summit in gleneagles , scotland next month but the pressure from the international community to present a plan soon is increasing .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .

and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .

whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few hundred people take part in a demonstration against welfare cuts in berlin monday , sept .
20 , 2004 .
and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .
made in germany it would be great if germans did n't have to tighten their belts and accept less generous benefits from the state , but the cold hard truth is that the country has lived above its means for years .
the whole situation is aggravated by the fact that most teutons are n't having enough children these days .
however , what 's key to realize is that these german problems are german made .
in recent months , there has been a tendency to look abroad for the cause of germany 's woes .
low-wage eastern europe and asia have been blamed for companies outsourcing german jobs .
and blood-thirsty yankee capitalists have become the bogeyman threatening germany 's precious social market economy by spreading a dangerous profit-maximization mentality .
do n't get me wrong - i 'm as concerned about the darker side of globalization as much as the next guy .
free trade and international competition should not lead to environmental and living standards of the lowest common denominator .
but reform-phobic , old school socialist recipes offered by the pds / wasg alliance are not the answer .
unfortunately , regardless of whether schröder or the conservative opposition wins the next election , the newly unified left-wingers will likely thrive in the next parliament .
freed from the burden of actually having to address the rather serious issues facing germany , gregor , oskar and friends can rage against either social democratic sell-outs or cutthroat christian democrats . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karl marx 's birthplace gets a makeover the karl marx house in trier has been renovated to include a new multimedia exhibition on the socialist thinker 's life and work .
it also offers a critical view of his influence on global ideologies and politics .
-lrb- june 9 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

but observers say they are unlikely to be extradited or to serve a sentence because of their advanced age . they stand trial over the killing of 560 people in the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema on august 12 , 1944 , a few days after the liberation of the nearby city of florence by british troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting was one of many in the region that occurred as german troops retreated to the so-called " gothic line " of defence that cut across italy from la spezia to the adriatic . buried evidence evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities - mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre - apparently stored in a filing cabinet found in a rome basement . ever since the " cabinet of shame " was found , prosecutors in la spezia have been fighting time to bring suspects to trial . " precise roles " prosecutor marco de paolis told the court in the port city of la spezia that there were " numerous elements " to prove the men , now living in germany , had " precise roles " in one of italy 's worst civilian massacres during world war ii . according to recent studies , the allied forces had initially wanted to try the nazi soldiers after the war , but the plans were shelved in 1947 .
by the late 1940s only a dozen court martial proceedings were closed . some of the few people who survived the massacre , most of whom were young children at the time , were present in the court on thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi war crimes trial opens in italy the trial of three former german ss officers , charged with killing 560 civilians in a 1944 massacre in northern italy , began at a military court in la spezia on tuesday .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

one host city already has an answer as to where all those extra transactions will take place . one of the seedier spin-offs of the soccer world cup that will take place in germany in 2006 is expected to be a boom in the local sex trade .
and that 's raising a host of concerns and considerations .
moral issues aside , order-loving city officials in dortmund have at least addressed the logistics of the pending flurry of entrepreneurial activity . after all , prostitutes will need places to service their clients .
and dortmund officials are determined that those places should ideally be removed from public streets , parks and residential areas . not surprisingly , the solution has been imported from germany 's liberal northern neighbor , the netherlands , in the form of a series of drive-in wooden " sex huts . " " in dortmund , we have an official red light district on the outskirts , but there is a problem .
there is not enough space for everyone to park , " a city official said . dortmund plans to arrange the huts in an area complete with condom vending machines and snack bars .
the huts have also been introduced in cologne , another world cup venue . " men have to get used to them of course , but a high percentage accept them because they can protect their anonymity , " the official said . experts estimate that as many as 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany to offer their services to soccer fans during the tournament . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brothel owner sells german parliament flag red , black and gold will no longer grace the entrance to a brothel in saxony-anhalt now that a deep-pocketed patriot has won the internet auction for the flag which once flew over the parliament building .

but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .

at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made a joint appeal in paris on friday for the process of ratifying the eu constitution to continue despite referendum defeats in france and the netherlands and the suspension of a plebiscite in britain . the leaders of the two countries that have been the traditional motor behind eu integration emphasized the need for europe to pull together and set forth the democratic process it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders meet in paris to discuss the future of the eu constitution and budget talks chirac said member states must unite in the " difficult times " following the french and dutch rejection of the charter .
" we are in agreement in reaffirming how much the european union … needs above all to unite and to reflect , " the french president said . no premature conclusions speaking at a press conference alongside chirac , schröder said it would be " premature " to give up on the constitution , which was designed to make decision-making easier in the enlarged , 25-nation union .
the eu should wait until other countries have voted on the constitution before taking a decision on its future . " it 's too early to draw any preliminary conclusions .
i think we have to first wait for the upcoming referendums in denmark , portugal and luxembourg and other countries , " he told reporters , implying that eu leaders should hold off on taking a decision on the future of the constitution until at least their end-year summit . luxembourg is set to hold a referendum in july , denmark in september and portugal in october . eu crisis widens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac welcomes schröder at the elysee palace in paris , 10 june 2005 .
ahead of next week 's mid-year summit , discussion about the future of the eu threatened to take another downward spin after schröder and chirac joined forces to criticize great britain 's stance on the bloc 's budget .
the two leaders announced on friday they wanted britain to give up a hard-won five-billion-euro -lrb- six-billion-dollar -rrb- annual rebate it gets from the eu budget – something british prime minister tony blair has bluntly ruled out . " above all our british friends must recognize how things have changed and the need for greater equity in the financial charges that each country bears , " chirac said addressing plans to reorganize the bloc 's budget for 2007-2013 at next week 's summit . chirac said the eu rebate britain won in 1984 after tough negotiations with then-prime minister margaret thatcher was outdated .
each eu member state " must make an effort " so that the bloc 's financial problems do not exacerbate the political ones revealed by the resistance to the eu constitution . but blair has refused to give way , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending , including a revision of costly eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers greatly benefit . france and germany 's forceful stance , and britain 's stubbornness to yield sets the scene for a dramatic summit of eu heads of state and government in brussels next thursday and friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .
-lrb- june 8 , 2005 -rrb- germany , britain clash over eu budget gerhard schröder has said germany is willing to compromise on the eu budget , but britain is sticking to its guns , claiming it will use a veto if need be to retain its discounted payments .

" i am satisfied that there is the political will of the richest countries to move forward , " british finance minister gordon brown , who has spearheaded the initiative , said in a televised interview with bbc . " it 's debt interest payments that prevent many poor countries from investing in health and education and i believe we could have the biggest debt write off the world has seen , " he said ahead of the meeting , which is seen as a precursor to next month 's g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown earlier this year , brown launched the so-called " marshall plan for africa " aimed at wiping out multilateral debt for the poorest nations and doubling annual development aid to 100 billion dollars by 2015 . the will is there under the two-pronged plan , britain has set out to convince the world 's wealthiest countries to cancel the 80-billion dollar multilateral debts owed by poor countries to the international monetary fund , the world bank and the african development bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children look on in envy while the older of the three proudly shows a 20 rand bill -lrb- about 5,5 usd -rrb- in front of their house in kanyiso , south africa " there is a will to come to an agreement , " brown said .
the difficulty is trying to find common ground for writing off the debt and funding the loss of debt interest payments by the international institutions . at a meeting earlier this week in washington , british prime minister tony blair and us president george w. bush said they were close to completing their proposal for canceling 100 percent of debt for the world 's poorest countries . according to the new york times on friday , britain and the us have agreed on a system to relieve 18 of the poorest nations , mostly in africa , of combined debt worth 16.7 billion dollars -lrb- 13.66 billion euros -rrb- . germany doubts compromise a definite agreement among all g8 members , however , has not been reached , and according to german government officials , who have rejected a 100 percent debt write-off as unfeasible , the main sticking point is the method of financing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty and famine go hand-in-hand in much of africa unlike the us-british plan , germany , france and japan are expected to back debt relief for just five countries and have pegged the extent of cancellation to specific criteria such as " good government . "
the europeans have also called for a finance proposal based on taxing commercial aviation fuel – a plan the us is reluctant to support . when asked about the possibility of finding a compromise at the two-day london meeting , german deputy finance minister caio koch-weser said he " doubts " whether that would happen . " i doubt it , but i do not exclude it , " he said .
" we are working to bring our positions closer together , the german said in london . under the brown-inspired proposal , which has at least tentative approval from several countries , the imf could sell off a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed .
while the imf has acknowledged the feasibility of the sale , the us has objected , saying that offloading the reserves would destabilize the markets . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 finance ministers under pressure finance ministers of the g8 are holding a preparatory meeting in london on friday and saturday ahead of next month 's summit in gleneagles , scotland .

but 50 kilograms of high-tech machinery could be employed to protect the world cup next year by hindering potential terrorist attacks . " ofro + detect " is a modern-sounding name .
the device definitely has the imposing look of a military tank - in miniature .
at 1.20 meters -lrb- almost four feet -rrb- , visitors to next year 's world cup in germany will have to be sure not to step on the panzer .
yet with a hefty 50 kilograms -lrb- about 100 pounds -rrb- on top of its tank tracks , spectators would most likely come away with a few stubbed toes should they tread on ofro .
the berlin-based company robowatch technologies hopes that the modern technology they have to offer will find a place in the anti-terror watch during next year 's world cup in germany .
ofro can take over those dangerous , and tedious , duties that most security officers do not want to assume , namely checking for atomic , biological and chemical , or abc , weapons .
ofro can roam the stadiums 12 hours at a time , the whole time its sensors can trace any dangerous weapons of mass destruction that may have been emitted into the stadium .
business manager ulf stremmel thinks that ofro is a " suitable instrument in the war against terror . "
bildunterschrift : you do n't have to smile for this camera camera and gas sensors the use of the robots in almost all areas means almost 100 percent dependability .
ofro is no different .
it does not need any bothersome coffee breaks , is the epitome of concentration and does n't tire .
in the 12 hours of operation time , it can cover 10,000 square meters at a speed of five kilometers -lrb- 3.1 miles -rrb- per hour .
the whole time it uses its thermal camera and sensors to detect possible terror hazards , according to the company 's chief developer , jens hanke .
the robot wirelessly transmits all the information that is gathered at a central location .
it also takes air samples and should there be irregularities , it sounds an alarm .
nothing can get in ofro 's way and it can steer through fan crowds all by itself .
waiting for its assignment the robowatch technologies management are still waiting to hear from security officials if ofro will actually be needed .
stremmel said that the robot 's presence could help in preparing countermeasures in the event of an attack .
naturally it can not replace humans fully but it could act as an important element in the area of security .
bildunterschrift : ofro wo n't emit any noxious gases the german interior ministry has yet to say whether they want to buy ofro for 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- or even just rent it for 3,500 euros per month .
one distinct advantage that ofro offers according to hanke is its integrity .
" our robots can be neither intimidated nor bribed , " he said .
but it could take valuable jobs away . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

finance ministers of the g8 are holding a preparatory meeting in london on friday and saturday ahead of next month 's summit in gleneagles , scotland .
at the top of the agenda is debt relief for africa . heading into a two day meeting in london , the finance ministers of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- , the world 's top eight industrial countries , find themselves facing one huge , almost unmanageable problem , namely debt relief for africa .
britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown would like to be able to present some kind of concrete result on saturday but there is a lot of ground that must be covered before the world 's poorest continent will be offered any kind of major debt assistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- and george w. bush said debt relief for africa is possible the announcement by us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair on tuesday that they were close to completing a proposal for an elimination of 100 percent of debt for the world 's poorest countries had a condition attached to it for africa 's leaders , namely there must be improvement in governance and corruption must be reduced .
as blair put it , the debt plan was not " a something-for-nothing deal . "
on the weekend , the finance ministers will unlikely sign any concrete deals , despite gordon brown 's determination to produce something .
" we wo n't have any results after the meeting on the weekend , " said one high-ranked german government official .
the g8 countries do all agree on providing more financial assistance for the world 's poorest countries but just how they should do it remains to be debated .
criticism from around the world the meeting of the g8 finance ministers is meant as preparation for the summit in gleneagles , scotland next month but the pressure from the international community to present a plan soon is increasing .
archbishop desmond tutu said on bbc radio that the " west must n't operate from a position of moral superiority . "
he pointed out the business scandals in the us and europe such as enron , worldcom and parmalat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob geldof organized the live aid concerts in london and philadelphia in 1985 irish rock star bob geldof lashed out at western governments , saying the calls to end corruption were a diversionary tactic .
" we do n't die of corruption .
they do because they are too poor to withstand the impact of a thief stealing their money - so it has to stop , " said the organizer of the live8 pop concerts that will take place immediately before the g8 summit .
another long-time aid friend of africa , irish rock star bono , met with eu commission president jose manuel barroso on thursday , and challenged eu leaders to forget national politics and open their wallets to boost development aid for africa .
what wo n't happen just how any final debt relief deal will look like is uncertain .
germany is skeptical of floating bonds on financial markets to increase development aid .
the us and japan oppose the idea .
also no longer on the bargaining table is the sale of international monetary fund gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids has also made development work in africa more difficult finally , the prospect of adding a surcharge to airline tickets to reduce the debt has fallen on deaf ears in the us and japan .
even in europe , the idea is not without controversy .
what the ministers supposedly have agreed upon is a $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.6 billion euros -rrb- package to finance immunizations .
just what else gordon brown will be able to show the world at the end of the two-day meeting with his colleagues remains to be seen . afp / dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair gets african aid pledge from bush us president george bush was to pledge $ 674 million in new aid for africa at a summit on tuesday with british leader tony blair .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few hundred people take part in a demonstration against welfare cuts in berlin monday , sept .
20 , 2004 .
and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .
made in germany it would be great if germans did n't have to tighten their belts and accept less generous benefits from the state , but the cold hard truth is that the country has lived above its means for years .
the whole situation is aggravated by the fact that most teutons are n't having enough children these days .
however , what 's key to realize is that these german problems are german made .
in recent months , there has been a tendency to look abroad for the cause of germany 's woes .
low-wage eastern europe and asia have been blamed for companies outsourcing german jobs .
and blood-thirsty yankee capitalists have become the bogeyman threatening germany 's precious social market economy by spreading a dangerous profit-maximization mentality .
do n't get me wrong - i 'm as concerned about the darker side of globalization as much as the next guy .
free trade and international competition should not lead to environmental and living standards of the lowest common denominator .
but reform-phobic , old school socialist recipes offered by the pds / wasg alliance are not the answer .
unfortunately , regardless of whether schröder or the conservative opposition wins the next election , the newly unified left-wingers will likely thrive in the next parliament .
freed from the burden of actually having to address the rather serious issues facing germany , gregor , oskar and friends can rage against either social democratic sell-outs or cutthroat christian democrats . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karl marx 's birthplace gets a makeover the karl marx house in trier has been renovated to include a new multimedia exhibition on the socialist thinker 's life and work .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 10.06.2005 the pope and gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spaniards celebrated the legalization of gay marriage in april pope benedict xvi recently spoke out against gay marriage , calling it a “ trivialization of the human body . ”
germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .

but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ? " or " what do you believe in ? , " frankfurt-based band " glashaus " and dancehall reggae act " gentleman " from cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there 's nothing reactionary about this new brand of contemporary christian rock .
despite their evangelical message , these young musicians are firmly anti the religious establishment .

" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ? " or " what do you believe in ? , " frankfurt-based band " glashaus " and dancehall reggae act " gentleman " from cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there 's nothing reactionary about this new brand of contemporary christian rock .
despite their evangelical message , these young musicians are firmly anti the religious establishment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2005 g8 focuses on debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world 's poorest countries are burdened by mounting debt top finance officials of the group of eight industrialized nations kicked off a meeting in london friday to try to clinch agreement on unprecedented debt relief for the world 's poorest countries . britain , which is hosting the talks as rotating chair of the g8 , has set alleviation of poverty in the world 's poorest countries as one of its main political goals this year and has lobbied hard to convince finance chiefs in canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia to agree to a major debt relief package . " i am satisfied that there is the political will of the richest countries to move forward , " british finance minister gordon brown , who has spearheaded the initiative , said in a televised interview with bbc . " it 's debt interest payments that prevent many poor countries from investing in health and education and i believe we could have the biggest debt write off the world has seen , " he said ahead of the meeting , which is seen as a precursor to next month 's g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown earlier this year , brown launched the so-called " marshall plan for africa " aimed at wiping out multilateral debt for the poorest nations and doubling annual development aid to 100 billion dollars by 2015 . the will is there under the two-pronged plan , britain has set out to convince the world 's wealthiest countries to cancel the 80-billion dollar multilateral debts owed by poor countries to the international monetary fund , the world bank and the african development bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two children look on in envy while the older of the three proudly shows a 20 rand bill -lrb- about 5,5 usd -rrb- in front of their house in kanyiso , south africa " there is a will to come to an agreement , " brown said .
the difficulty is trying to find common ground for writing off the debt and funding the loss of debt interest payments by the international institutions . at a meeting earlier this week in washington , british prime minister tony blair and us president george w. bush said they were close to completing their proposal for canceling 100 percent of debt for the world 's poorest countries . according to the new york times on friday , britain and the us have agreed on a system to relieve 18 of the poorest nations , mostly in africa , of combined debt worth 16.7 billion dollars -lrb- 13.66 billion euros -rrb- . germany doubts compromise a definite agreement among all g8 members , however , has not been reached , and according to german government officials , who have rejected a 100 percent debt write-off as unfeasible , the main sticking point is the method of financing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty and famine go hand-in-hand in much of africa unlike the us-british plan , germany , france and japan are expected to back debt relief for just five countries and have pegged the extent of cancellation to specific criteria such as " good government . "
the europeans have also called for a finance proposal based on taxing commercial aviation fuel – a plan the us is reluctant to support . when asked about the possibility of finding a compromise at the two-day london meeting , german deputy finance minister caio koch-weser said he " doubts " whether that would happen . " i doubt it , but i do not exclude it , " he said .
" we are working to bring our positions closer together , the german said in london . under the brown-inspired proposal , which has at least tentative approval from several countries , the imf could sell off a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed .
while the imf has acknowledged the feasibility of the sale , the us has objected , saying that offloading the reserves would destabilize the markets . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 finance ministers under pressure finance ministers of the g8 are holding a preparatory meeting in london on friday and saturday ahead of next month 's summit in gleneagles , scotland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.06.2005 a german hip hopper 's hallelujah in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavier naidoo thanks god for the music a high-octane performance by messianic pop star xavier naidoo and his band die söhne mannheims in tel aviv served as a rousing testament to the rise of religion in german pop . it 's not often that the tel aviv opera house attracts this kind of audience .
but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ? " or " what do you believe in ? , " frankfurt-based band " glashaus " and dancehall reggae act " gentleman " from cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there 's nothing reactionary about this new brand of contemporary christian rock .
despite their evangelical message , these young musicians are firmly anti the religious establishment .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made a joint appeal in paris on friday for the process of ratifying the eu constitution to continue despite referendum defeats in france and the netherlands and the suspension of a plebiscite in britain . the leaders of the two countries that have been the traditional motor behind eu integration emphasized the need for europe to pull together and set forth the democratic process it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders meet in paris to discuss the future of the eu constitution and budget talks chirac said member states must unite in the " difficult times " following the french and dutch rejection of the charter .

the two leaders announced on friday they wanted britain to give up a hard-won five-billion-euro -lrb- six-billion-dollar -rrb- annual rebate it gets from the eu budget – something british prime minister tony blair has bluntly ruled out .

each eu member state " must make an effort " so that the bloc 's financial problems do not exacerbate the political ones revealed by the resistance to the eu constitution . but blair has refused to give way , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending , including a revision of costly eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers greatly benefit . france and germany 's forceful stance , and britain 's stubbornness to yield sets the scene for a dramatic summit of eu heads of state and government in brussels next thursday and friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few hundred people take part in a demonstration against welfare cuts in berlin monday , sept .
20 , 2004 .
and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .
made in germany it would be great if germans did n't have to tighten their belts and accept less generous benefits from the state , but the cold hard truth is that the country has lived above its means for years .
the whole situation is aggravated by the fact that most teutons are n't having enough children these days .
however , what 's key to realize is that these german problems are german made .
in recent months , there has been a tendency to look abroad for the cause of germany 's woes .
low-wage eastern europe and asia have been blamed for companies outsourcing german jobs .
and blood-thirsty yankee capitalists have become the bogeyman threatening germany 's precious social market economy by spreading a dangerous profit-maximization mentality .
do n't get me wrong - i 'm as concerned about the darker side of globalization as much as the next guy .
free trade and international competition should not lead to environmental and living standards of the lowest common denominator .
but reform-phobic , old school socialist recipes offered by the pds / wasg alliance are not the answer .
unfortunately , regardless of whether schröder or the conservative opposition wins the next election , the newly unified left-wingers will likely thrive in the next parliament .
freed from the burden of actually having to address the rather serious issues facing germany , gregor , oskar and friends can rage against either social democratic sell-outs or cutthroat christian democrats . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karl marx 's birthplace gets a makeover the karl marx house in trier has been renovated to include a new multimedia exhibition on the socialist thinker 's life and work .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .

old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few hundred people take part in a demonstration against welfare cuts in berlin monday , sept .
20 , 2004 .
and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .
made in germany it would be great if germans did n't have to tighten their belts and accept less generous benefits from the state , but the cold hard truth is that the country has lived above its means for years .
the whole situation is aggravated by the fact that most teutons are n't having enough children these days .
however , what 's key to realize is that these german problems are german made .
in recent months , there has been a tendency to look abroad for the cause of germany 's woes .
low-wage eastern europe and asia have been blamed for companies outsourcing german jobs .
and blood-thirsty yankee capitalists have become the bogeyman threatening germany 's precious social market economy by spreading a dangerous profit-maximization mentality .
do n't get me wrong - i 'm as concerned about the darker side of globalization as much as the next guy .
free trade and international competition should not lead to environmental and living standards of the lowest common denominator .
but reform-phobic , old school socialist recipes offered by the pds / wasg alliance are not the answer .
unfortunately , regardless of whether schröder or the conservative opposition wins the next election , the newly unified left-wingers will likely thrive in the next parliament .
freed from the burden of actually having to address the rather serious issues facing germany , gregor , oskar and friends can rage against either social democratic sell-outs or cutthroat christian democrats . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karl marx 's birthplace gets a makeover the karl marx house in trier has been renovated to include a new multimedia exhibition on the socialist thinker 's life and work .
it also offers a critical view of his influence on global ideologies and politics .
-lrb- june 9 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .
-lrb- may 26 , 2005 -rrb- the year of the locust a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism .

their trial in absentia opened last year and has provoked strong emotions in italy .
the men , accused of aggravated homicide , are not even expected to attend the verdict , due on june 22 , officials at the military tribunal said .
but observers say they are unlikely to be extradited or to serve a sentence because of their advanced age . they stand trial over the killing of 560 people in the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema on august 12 , 1944 , a few days after the liberation of the nearby city of florence by british troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting was one of many in the region that occurred as german troops retreated to the so-called " gothic line " of defence that cut across italy from la spezia to the adriatic . buried evidence evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities - mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre - apparently stored in a filing cabinet found in a rome basement . ever since the " cabinet of shame " was found , prosecutors in la spezia have been fighting time to bring suspects to trial . " precise roles " prosecutor marco de paolis told the court in the port city of la spezia that there were " numerous elements " to prove the men , now living in germany , had " precise roles " in one of italy 's worst civilian massacres during world war ii . according to recent studies , the allied forces had initially wanted to try the nazi soldiers after the war , but the plans were shelved in 1947 .

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made a joint appeal in paris on friday for the process of ratifying the eu constitution to continue despite referendum defeats in france and the netherlands and the suspension of a plebiscite in britain . the leaders of the two countries that have been the traditional motor behind eu integration emphasized the need for europe to pull together and set forth the democratic process it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders meet in paris to discuss the future of the eu constitution and budget talks chirac said member states must unite in the " difficult times " following the french and dutch rejection of the charter .
" we are in agreement in reaffirming how much the european union … needs above all to unite and to reflect , " the french president said . no premature conclusions speaking at a press conference alongside chirac , schröder said it would be " premature " to give up on the constitution , which was designed to make decision-making easier in the enlarged , 25-nation union .
the eu should wait until other countries have voted on the constitution before taking a decision on its future . " it 's too early to draw any preliminary conclusions .
i think we have to first wait for the upcoming referendums in denmark , portugal and luxembourg and other countries , " he told reporters , implying that eu leaders should hold off on taking a decision on the future of the constitution until at least their end-year summit . luxembourg is set to hold a referendum in july , denmark in september and portugal in october . eu crisis widens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac welcomes schröder at the elysee palace in paris , 10 june 2005 .
ahead of next week 's mid-year summit , discussion about the future of the eu threatened to take another downward spin after schröder and chirac joined forces to criticize great britain 's stance on the bloc 's budget .
the two leaders announced on friday they wanted britain to give up a hard-won five-billion-euro -lrb- six-billion-dollar -rrb- annual rebate it gets from the eu budget – something british prime minister tony blair has bluntly ruled out . " above all our british friends must recognize how things have changed and the need for greater equity in the financial charges that each country bears , " chirac said addressing plans to reorganize the bloc 's budget for 2007-2013 at next week 's summit . chirac said the eu rebate britain won in 1984 after tough negotiations with then-prime minister margaret thatcher was outdated .
each eu member state " must make an effort " so that the bloc 's financial problems do not exacerbate the political ones revealed by the resistance to the eu constitution . but blair has refused to give way , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending , including a revision of costly eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers greatly benefit . france and germany 's forceful stance , and britain 's stubbornness to yield sets the scene for a dramatic summit of eu heads of state and government in brussels next thursday and friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

at the same time , a clash threatens to split the bloc over the upcoming budget debate . french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made a joint appeal in paris on friday for the process of ratifying the eu constitution to continue despite referendum defeats in france and the netherlands and the suspension of a plebiscite in britain . the leaders of the two countries that have been the traditional motor behind eu integration emphasized the need for europe to pull together and set forth the democratic process it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and german leaders meet in paris to discuss the future of the eu constitution and budget talks chirac said member states must unite in the " difficult times " following the french and dutch rejection of the charter .

the eu should wait until other countries have voted on the constitution before taking a decision on its future . " it 's too early to draw any preliminary conclusions .

the two leaders announced on friday they wanted britain to give up a hard-won five-billion-euro -lrb- six-billion-dollar -rrb- annual rebate it gets from the eu budget – something british prime minister tony blair has bluntly ruled out .

each eu member state " must make an effort " so that the bloc 's financial problems do not exacerbate the political ones revealed by the resistance to the eu constitution . but blair has refused to give way , calling instead for a " fundamental review " of eu spending , including a revision of costly eu agricultural subsidies from which french farmers greatly benefit . france and germany 's forceful stance , and britain 's stubbornness to yield sets the scene for a dramatic summit of eu heads of state and government in brussels next thursday and friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer discusses eu future in us on what could be his farewell trip to the united states as germany 's foreign minister , joschka fischer discussed turkish membership in the eu and the eu role in the world in the aftermath of the consitutional crisis .

the mexicans , who arrive in germany on the back of an 18-match unbeaten record , will be without star striker blanco who pulled out of the squad one day after leading his club america to the domestic title at the end of may , saying he was tired .
another five players are the subject of a request by their club guadalajara to be released from the confed cup to play in the libertadores cup , the south american equivalent of the champions league , which clashes with the tournament in germany .
mexico 's coach ricardo la volpe has been criticized for his handling of the situation with his detractors saying that he accepted blanco 's decision to withdraw from the squad but wants the guadalajara contingent to stay .
la volpe has hit back : " the mistake that all the journalists and the president of chivas -lrb- jorge vergara -rrb- have made is that i did n't give any special permission to cuauhtemoc blanco , " he said .
" he was on the list , he said he was tired and i replaced him with someone else , i did n't give any special permission for anyone . "

but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ?

but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ?

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

germans criticized him for that and dw-world readers seem split on the matter . i am a believer myself and no church is going to dictate to me that i must now suddenly be anything else but gay , because i was born that .
i feel that anyone should have the right to be what they truly are and here in south africa we at least have a constitution that guarantees that .
why can the world not allow consenting adults to live their lives the way they are - provided that it does not harm anyone and does not involve children ? - pieter niemand , south africa i totally agree with pope benedict xvi on gay marriage , and for that matter , pope john paul ii , and every other pope since peter .
there is no moral or theological justification for the marriage of two people of the same sex .
it is an anathema .
homosexuality is sin , just as fornication and other extra-marital sex is sinful .
marriage , by definition , is the joining of a male and a female . - micha el murphy i believe that the catholic church is still in the middle ages .
the world has changed and the church needs to change to align itself with what is going on in the world .
i think gays should be allowed some sort of blessing / civil ceremony , if people 's reactions to a marriage are so strong .
they should be allowed to adopt children .
they just want what we all want , life , love and togetherness in trust and love . - lee ann g. , us any couple who want to marry should be allowed to marry , regardless of sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , religious and spiritual beliefs / practices , culture , etc . - nicole raisin stern , us i fully agree with the position of the catholic church in the question of gay marriage .
however , i do n't agree with the position of the catholic church regarding homosexual orientation .
the catholic church believes that homosexual orientation is not a sin , i believe that homosexual orientation is a sin .
but i also believe that homosexuals deserve to be respected in their way of life - that is that they should not endure unjust discriminations , and i do n't believe that banning gay marriage is an unjust discrimination . - esteban rodriguez , costa rica bildunterschrift : while pope benedict xvi celebrated his installation mass in st. peter 's square at the vatican , sunday , april 24 , 2005 . the more i hear of this pope , the more i am considering becoming a catholic . - chuck reichert i definitely disagree with the pope 's views on same-sex marriages and homosexuality .
the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

the pope should focus on the real problems in the world and the real problems in the catholic church .
i feel like the church using homosexuals as a red herring to distract us from issues such as the child sexual abuse scandals in the united states .
the vatican immediately silences anyone who disagrees with the pope 's stance on homosexuality and other social issues .
the vatican should discuss homosexuality and same-sex marriages rather than silence and bully those who disagree with them .
also , if the catholic church truly believes that homosexuals should not be discriminated against , then maybe they should teach tolerance and stop trying to block the brazilian un resolution that is meant to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination . - yasser al-saadi , canada pope benedict is as wrong on this issue as his predecessors were in sanctioning slavery for a great many centuries .
i am a catholic but on this issue the church needs to understand that the passages in scriptures traditionally interpreted as condemning homosexuality are based on a pre-modern understanding of heterosexuality as the status of all people . - thomas murphy as a psychologist and philosopher , it is obvious for me that the right to marry will do a lot of good for many gay men and women , and therefore for the well being of modern societies .
the words of benedict show that no serious reflection has occurred among vatican theologians , who have been repeating the same thing for decades . - pierre pelletier as a non-catholic christian i totally support the position of pope benedict on the issue of gay marriage .
i do not care what non-christian religions do , but acceptance of gay marriage in the church is an intolerable evil .
it is no less an evil than the acceptance of adultery , bestiality or any other sexual sin .
god has set boundaries for us christians and we have a responsibility to remain within those boundaries .
this issue is absolutely not about mercy . - charles reichert , canada i wrote a letter , in october 2000 , to cardinal joseph ratzinger , then head of the congregation of the doctrine and faith , previously named the office of the inquisition , showing that a careful reading of the official roman catholic catechism could support gay and lesbian marriage .
section 2349 of the catechism quotes st. ambrose , the bishop that converted st. augustine : " there are three forms of the virtue of chastity : the first is that of spouses , the second that of widows , and the third that of virgins .
we do not praise any one of them to the exclusion of the others . this is what makes for the richness of the discipline of the church . "
infertile married couples are allowed " conjugal chastity " if the roman church permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry , they would be under the same rule . - lisa rodke send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize pope 's views on gays the german green party and a major gay rights group have criticized a speech by pope benedict xvi in which he said gay marriage was “ based on a trivialization of the human body . ”

in their three tournaments since the cup took on the confederations format , australia have reached the final once -lrb- where they were turned over 6-0 by a majestic brazil -rrb- and have come away with their dignity intact on the other two occasions . it 's a shame for the socceroos that their successes in the oceania group have yet to be transferred to the world cup stage .
the oceania representative must always face a play-off with an asian team for a place at the finals and australia often find this to be a game too far when it is their turn , not new zealand 's , to represent the group . despite this , with a team made up of stars who play their soccer all over the world in the top leagues , australia will once again bring color and commitment to germany and the confederations cup . -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2005 nazi massacre trial reopens old wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily -lrb- center -rrb- honored the victims in 2004 a prosecutor on thursday demanded life imprisonment for 10 former nazi german soldiers , now in their 80s , who are on trial for the wartime nazi massacre of 560 civilians in an italian mountain village . marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life , in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . none of the defendants were present in the courtroom .
their trial in absentia opened last year and has provoked strong emotions in italy .
the men , accused of aggravated homicide , are not even expected to attend the verdict , due on june 22 , officials at the military tribunal said .
but observers say they are unlikely to be extradited or to serve a sentence because of their advanced age . they stand trial over the killing of 560 people in the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema on august 12 , 1944 , a few days after the liberation of the nearby city of florence by british troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting was one of many in the region that occurred as german troops retreated to the so-called " gothic line " of defence that cut across italy from la spezia to the adriatic . buried evidence evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities - mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre - apparently stored in a filing cabinet found in a rome basement . ever since the " cabinet of shame " was found , prosecutors in la spezia have been fighting time to bring suspects to trial . " precise roles " prosecutor marco de paolis told the court in the port city of la spezia that there were " numerous elements " to prove the men , now living in germany , had " precise roles " in one of italy 's worst civilian massacres during world war ii . according to recent studies , the allied forces had initially wanted to try the nazi soldiers after the war , but the plans were shelved in 1947 .
by the late 1940s only a dozen court martial proceedings were closed . some of the few people who survived the massacre , most of whom were young children at the time , were present in the court on thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi war crimes trial opens in italy the trial of three former german ss officers , charged with killing 560 civilians in a 1944 massacre in northern italy , began at a military court in la spezia on tuesday .

their trial in absentia opened last year and has provoked strong emotions in italy .
the men , accused of aggravated homicide , are not even expected to attend the verdict , due on june 22 , officials at the military tribunal said .
but observers say they are unlikely to be extradited or to serve a sentence because of their advanced age . they stand trial over the killing of 560 people in the tuscan village of sant 'anna di stazzema on august 12 , 1944 , a few days after the liberation of the nearby city of florence by british troops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting was one of many in the region that occurred as german troops retreated to the so-called " gothic line " of defence that cut across italy from la spezia to the adriatic . buried evidence evidence about the massacre remained buried for nearly half a century , a victim of successive rome governments ' reluctance to pursue former nazis for wartime atrocities - mainly to avoid diplomatic repercussions with west germany in the post-war period . many believe successive post-war governments wanted to avoid hunting nazis for war crimes because they would also have to delve uncomfortably into the excesses of fascist dictator benito mussolini , particularly his treatment of italian jews . the case came to light only in 1994 after prosecutors stumbled across witness statements given to allied soldiers investigating the massacre - apparently stored in a filing cabinet found in a rome basement . ever since the " cabinet of shame " was found , prosecutors in la spezia have been fighting time to bring suspects to trial . " precise roles " prosecutor marco de paolis told the court in the port city of la spezia that there were " numerous elements " to prove the men , now living in germany , had " precise roles " in one of italy 's worst civilian massacres during world war ii . according to recent studies , the allied forces had initially wanted to try the nazi soldiers after the war , but the plans were shelved in 1947 .
by the late 1940s only a dozen court martial proceedings were closed . some of the few people who survived the massacre , most of whom were young children at the time , were present in the court on thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi war crimes trial opens in italy the trial of three former german ss officers , charged with killing 560 civilians in a 1944 massacre in northern italy , began at a military court in la spezia on tuesday .

the berlin-based company robowatch technologies hopes that the modern technology they have to offer will find a place in the anti-terror watch during next year 's world cup in germany .
ofro can take over those dangerous , and tedious , duties that most security officers do not want to assume , namely checking for atomic , biological and chemical , or abc , weapons .
ofro can roam the stadiums 12 hours at a time , the whole time its sensors can trace any dangerous weapons of mass destruction that may have been emitted into the stadium .

the robot wirelessly transmits all the information that is gathered at a central location .
it also takes air samples and should there be irregularities , it sounds an alarm .
nothing can get in ofro 's way and it can steer through fan crowds all by itself .
waiting for its assignment the robowatch technologies management are still waiting to hear from security officials if ofro will actually be needed .
stremmel said that the robot 's presence could help in preparing countermeasures in the event of an attack .
naturally it can not replace humans fully but it could act as an important element in the area of security .
bildunterschrift : ofro wo n't emit any noxious gases the german interior ministry has yet to say whether they want to buy ofro for 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- or even just rent it for 3,500 euros per month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.06.2005 nazi massacre trial reopens old wounds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily -lrb- center -rrb- honored the victims in 2004 a prosecutor on thursday demanded life imprisonment for 10 former nazi german soldiers , now in their 80s , who are on trial for the wartime nazi massacre of 560 civilians in an italian mountain village . marco de paolis called for the military court in the northwestern italian port city of la spezia to jail the 10 for life , in a hearing followed emotionally by survivors . none of the defendants were present in the courtroom .
their trial in absentia opened last year and has provoked strong emotions in italy .
the men , accused of aggravated homicide , are not even expected to attend the verdict , due on june 22 , officials at the military tribunal said .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .

but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .

the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .
made in germany it would be great if germans did n't have to tighten their belts and accept less generous benefits from the state , but the cold hard truth is that the country has lived above its means for years .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .

but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .

the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .

while the new alliance of two leftist parties for germany 's early general election this fall might make the campaign more colorful , it certainly wo n't help the country , says dw-world 's marc young . perhaps one should n't really expect anything less from the birthplace of karl marx .
whereas in most other western democracies old school socialists are relegated to furthest fringes of political life , in germany they are on the verge of a renaissance .
old prejudices and big egos were put on the back burner as two far-left groups - one based in eastern and the other in western germany joined forces for planned parliamentary elections in september .
the cooperation was announced early friday morning .
the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- and the election alternative for social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- have been hard at work hammering out the details of their prospective alliance .
the social democrats ' former party chairman , oskar lafontaine , who gave up his spd party membership less than two weeks ago , has now said he will be available to run as a candidate for the new leftist coalition .
according to election analysts , this means the new left wing coalition could stand a realistic chance of passing the 5 percent threshold required to enter the bundestag .
the pds , which was born out of the ashes of the east german communist party , has never been able to establish a foothold in the west .
the nascent wasg , made up of disgruntled western social democrats and trade unionists , completes the geography nicely .
hand-in-hand at the vanguard of this socialist movement will be two prominent politicians representing both halves of the once divided nation : lafontaine - and gregor gysi .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi with the telegenic gysi rejoining active politics , the pds already stood a good shot of getting back into the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , after failing to make the grade in 2002 .
but it 's oskar lafontaine who could make the alliance a serious pan-german political force .
jeopardizing reform i suppose one could choose to see this as another important step along the long and tortuous path of german reunification .
however , i 'm somewhat more distracted by what the united lefty lot will mean for the country 's willingness to continue on the rather more important path of economic reform .
plagued by high unemployment and sluggish growth , the last thing germany needs now is a gaggle of unreformed leftist hardliners rallying opposition to overhaul the country 's bloated and untenable welfare state .

20 , 2004 .
and make no mistake , that 's what this outfit will be all about .
the wasg was formed out of direct opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder 's so-called agenda 2010 - a rather modest package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms .
for its part , the pds has always been so far from power and responsibility at the federal level that the party platform has long been largely reality-free .
made in germany it would be great if germans did n't have to tighten their belts and accept less generous benefits from the state , but the cold hard truth is that the country has lived above its means for years .
the whole situation is aggravated by the fact that most teutons are n't having enough children these days .
however , what 's key to realize is that these german problems are german made .
in recent months , there has been a tendency to look abroad for the cause of germany 's woes .
low-wage eastern europe and asia have been blamed for companies outsourcing german jobs .
and blood-thirsty yankee capitalists have become the bogeyman threatening germany 's precious social market economy by spreading a dangerous profit-maximization mentality .
do n't get me wrong - i 'm as concerned about the darker side of globalization as much as the next guy .
free trade and international competition should not lead to environmental and living standards of the lowest common denominator .
but reform-phobic , old school socialist recipes offered by the pds / wasg alliance are not the answer .
unfortunately , regardless of whether schröder or the conservative opposition wins the next election , the newly unified left-wingers will likely thrive in the next parliament .
freed from the burden of actually having to address the rather serious issues facing germany , gregor , oskar and friends can rage against either social democratic sell-outs or cutthroat christian democrats . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de karl marx 's birthplace gets a makeover the karl marx house in trier has been renovated to include a new multimedia exhibition on the socialist thinker 's life and work .
it also offers a critical view of his influence on global ideologies and politics .
-lrb- june 9 , 2005 -rrb- a threat from the left for schröder ?
oskar lafontaine , ex-chairman of germany 's social democrats , has left the party to support a possible new left-wing alliance to challenge chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left government in the upcoming election .

britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown would like to be able to present some kind of concrete result on saturday but there is a lot of ground that must be covered before the world 's poorest continent will be offered any kind of major debt assistance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- and george w. bush said debt relief for africa is possible the announcement by us president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair on tuesday that they were close to completing a proposal for an elimination of 100 percent of debt for the world 's poorest countries had a condition attached to it for africa 's leaders , namely there must be improvement in governance and corruption must be reduced .
as blair put it , the debt plan was not " a something-for-nothing deal . "
on the weekend , the finance ministers will unlikely sign any concrete deals , despite gordon brown 's determination to produce something .
" we wo n't have any results after the meeting on the weekend , " said one high-ranked german government official .
the g8 countries do all agree on providing more financial assistance for the world 's poorest countries but just how they should do it remains to be debated .
criticism from around the world the meeting of the g8 finance ministers is meant as preparation for the summit in gleneagles , scotland next month but the pressure from the international community to present a plan soon is increasing .
archbishop desmond tutu said on bbc radio that the " west must n't operate from a position of moral superiority . "
he pointed out the business scandals in the us and europe such as enron , worldcom and parmalat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bob geldof organized the live aid concerts in london and philadelphia in 1985 irish rock star bob geldof lashed out at western governments , saying the calls to end corruption were a diversionary tactic .
" we do n't die of corruption .
they do because they are too poor to withstand the impact of a thief stealing their money - so it has to stop , " said the organizer of the live8 pop concerts that will take place immediately before the g8 summit .
another long-time aid friend of africa , irish rock star bono , met with eu commission president jose manuel barroso on thursday , and challenged eu leaders to forget national politics and open their wallets to boost development aid for africa .
what wo n't happen just how any final debt relief deal will look like is uncertain .
germany is skeptical of floating bonds on financial markets to increase development aid .
the us and japan oppose the idea .
also no longer on the bargaining table is the sale of international monetary fund gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids has also made development work in africa more difficult finally , the prospect of adding a surcharge to airline tickets to reduce the debt has fallen on deaf ears in the us and japan .
even in europe , the idea is not without controversy .
what the ministers supposedly have agreed upon is a $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.6 billion euros -rrb- package to finance immunizations .
just what else gordon brown will be able to show the world at the end of the two-day meeting with his colleagues remains to be seen . afp / dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair gets african aid pledge from bush us president george bush was to pledge $ 674 million in new aid for africa at a summit on tuesday with british leader tony blair .
but washington will not back a key part of blair 's plan to ease african poverty .
-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- eu agrees air travel tax to fund aid eu finance ministers meeting in luxembourg on saturday agreed in principle to levy a tax on airplane tickets to fund extra development aid .
the tax would be voluntary or obligatory depending on the country .
-lrb- may 14 , 2005 -rrb- eu to boost development aid the european union has agreed to increase public spending on development aid by 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- over the next five years , reinforcing europe 's role as a leading donor to poorer countries .

" they realize that as we are the world 's largest producer of polyester today , we can help them , " he said . " i could n't say that every single one of the 2000 employees we have in trevira open-minded , that of course is not true .
but by and large , we were welcomed and they are responding .
and we help them by taking them to india and showing them our operations .

" maybe not in the best english , but so what ? " manager bernhard steinrücke said that german companies and indian management are a match made in heaven . " the indians are great believers in german technology , reliance and educational standards , " he said .
" what we germans are lacking is motivation , or what i call the feel good factor .

but when german band " die söhne mannheims " took to the stage this week as part of the 2005 celebrations marking forty years of israeli-german diplomatic relations , the grandiose building reverberated with the enthusiastic shouts of thousands of young fans who 've probably never even heard of verdi . " who 's from tel aviv ? " yelled frontman xavier naidoo in english .
half the audience 's hands went up .
he gave it another go .
" who 's from germany ? "
this time , there were cheers from every corner .
the crowd was made up primarily of israeli kids who have lived in germany , and young german jews who have emigrated to israel .
and they all loved the show . make some " noiz " obviously , a concert by one of germany 's most popular bands is a rare occurrence in israel , but the fact that the band feels a deep affinity with the country is even more unusual .
the band even named their debut album , which was released in 2000 and sold over one million copies , " zion , " following it up with another named " noiz " - zion spelt backwards . " our faith means a lot to us , " said band member michael herberger .
" and it 's a great honor to appear in the holy land .
as devout christians , we have a very close bond with israel . " the band kicked off the show with a revamped version of the ancient hebrew prayer " adon olam , " which brought down the house .
singing in hebrew was obviously an inspired move . " it was n't so difficult , " naidoo was quoted in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" hebrew is n't so different to german - a lot of the vowels sounds are similar . " not many performers would have braved a trip to israel given the volatile political situation .
but naidoo is n't just any old pop star . " i was n't scared , " said naidoo , whose roots are south african and indian .
" i was before i got here , because i 'm influenced by all the media images .
but i have friends who live here , so i saw how they deal with it all - and basically they live the same way we do , just with a different consciousness . " religious rock bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a right-on approach that 's typical of naidoo .
he might be one of germany 's best-selling recording artists , but you 're more likely to catch him brushing up on bible studies than trashing hotel rooms .
he even likes his christian name to be pronounced to rhyme with " savior . " his success means he gets to rub shoulders with the likes of kylie minogue and enrique iglesias , but naidoo is still something of an anomaly in the glossy world of bubblegum pop .
even though hits such as " ich kenne nichts , " -lrb- i know nothing -rrb- , co-written with wutang clan frontman rza , ensure he 's a regular fixture at the top of the german charts , he 's always eschewed the standard trappings of the successful pop star . but what really sets his blend of r & b-influenced soul apart from other radio-friendly rock offerings is that it 's steeped in christian fervor - a far less common phenomenon in germany 's music industry than in the us , where no self-respecting hip hopper would dream of accepting an award without profusely thanking god . naidoo 's music is shot through with a missionary zeal that 's impossible to overlook , with lyrics that draw heavily on fiery old testament imagery .
moreover , he refuses to succumb to record company pressure and write in english - a stance that put him in the vanguard of the recent movement calling for a radio quota for german musicians . a new social and religious conscience bildunterschrift : although he 's best-known for his solo career , his bands " die söhne mannheims " as well as " brother 's keepers " also command a loyal following , and have put their high profile to good use with regular appearances in anti-fascist campaigns .
these musical collectives are cultural melting pots , with members proud of their various ethnic jamaican , zimbabwean and ethiopian roots , to name but a few .
their musical style is equally diverse , merging rap , soul and r & b - and sung , of course , in german . their success has helped spawn a new generation of artistes who wear their faith on their sleeve , including the cherubic looking pop star ben -lrb- whose first big hit was called " engel , " or " " angel " -rrb- , one of this year 's candidates for the german knock-out round of the eurovision song contest , " beatbetrieb , " whose entry was called " woran glaubst du ? " or " what do you believe in ? , " frankfurt-based band " glashaus " and dancehall reggae act " gentleman " from cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there 's nothing reactionary about this new brand of contemporary christian rock .
despite their evangelical message , these young musicians are firmly anti the religious establishment .

towards the end of 2004 , the most hawkish forecasters were contemplating a fall in prices of up to 7 % this year .
almost half way through the year , however , there have been few signs of prices falling off a cliff , with data showing instead a market largely in stagnation .
stable interest rates , steady economic growth and underlying confidence in future prospects are expected to limit any price falls , experts say .
modest adjustment the most recent market information has given encouragement to those who forecast a modest adjustment in house prices after the runaway growth of the past few years .
the halifax said this week that the market had been largely flat to date this year , with prices falling just 0.1 % over the past five months .
nationwide , on the other hand , saw prices rise 0.5 % on a three month basis to may , averaging a 0.2 % uplift in each of the past three months .
there is evidence that prices are falling , but it is happening much more slowly than we were expecting ed stansfield , capital economics experts ' forecasts for 2005 there is no doubt the property market has cooled off considerably from the feverish state it was in during 2002 , 2003 and the first half of 2004 .
the number of properties being sold is 30 % lower than this time last year .
buyer enquiries are largely flat while the number of new mortgage approvals is about 40,000 below its 2004 peak .
the annual rate of house price inflation - above 20 % for much of 2004 - is now running at a fraction of last year 's levels .
according to the halifax , annual inflation is now at its lowest in four years , prices rising just 5.7 % in the year to may , while the nationwide says the market is slower than at any time since 1996 .
' too gloomy ' nevertheless , a fall in the pace of growth has so far not translated into a precipitous drop in prices .
some experts believe prices will continue to rise in 2005 , albeit by a much smaller amount than before , while those most pessimistic eight months ago are having to reconsider their positions .
" there is evidence that prices are falling , but it is happening much more slowly than we were expecting , " says ed stansfield , property economist at capital economics .
last year , capital economics put its neck on the block , claiming that house prices were overvalued by about 20 % and could fall by as much as 7 % in 2005 .
mr stansfield says the market is clearly undergoing a correction but agrees that predictions of a ' crash ' look far-fetched so far .
" that 7 % figure is beginning to look far too gloomy , with a 2-3 % fall more likely . "
rates hope economists point out that current conditions have little in common with those of the early 1990s , the time of the last housing crash .
a record number of people are in work , the economy remains healthy while interest rates , despite having risen significantly over the past year , are still at low levels compared with much of the past 30 years .
housing facts the average price of a house - according to the halifax - was £ 162,411 in may house sales last month were 30 % lower than in 2004 mortgage approvals rose in each of the past three months first-time buyers are at a 20-year low consumers may be tightening their belts - with dire consequences for many retailers - but experts believe that confidence is gradually seeping back to the market on the hope that interest rates may have peaked .
" we are beginning to see a small increase in activity again , " says tom vosa , chief economist at yorkshire bank .
" there was an expectation that the monetary policy committee -lrb- of the bank of england -rrb- had unfinished business with interest rates and that we might see further rises .
" since february , that expectation has come off . "
first-time buyers the slowdown in the market has coincided with what is generally the busiest time of the year for house sales .
as summer turns to autumn , the market could come under more pressure , particularly if sellers are not willing to lower their price expectations and nervous buyers - worried about overstretching themselves - seek to drive a hard bargain .
stagnating prices will be of little comfort to many first-time buyers not seeing properties becoming much more affordable .
although prices are falling as a multiple of average earnings , the average cost of a house is more than five times that of an average salary .
households are more vulnerable to rising interest rates than in a long while richard jeffrey , bridgewell securities bank keeps rates at 4.75 % " without demand waning i can not see property prices going to crash and it does n't seem that demand is waning , " says helen adams , of firstrungnow , a property website aimed at first-time buyers .
" people are going to have to look at more innovative ownership schemes and financing options to buy their first home . "
dose of reality house prices have risen in each of the past nine years .
should they fall in 2005 , as is possible , it will be a shock to people accustomed to their investments gaining in value .
many homeowners will also be keeping their fingers firmly crossed that the rate of borrowing does not rise any further .
" there is no doubt households are more vulnerable to rising interest rates than in a long while due to the high level of indebtedness , " says richard jeffrey , head of research at bridgewell securities .
increased activity in the housing market allied to rising inflationary pressures could yet put more upwards pressure on rates , mr jeffrey warns .
" the higher interest rates go the less likely the housing market will remain completely unaffected .
" i do n't think that is on the cards this year but it is possible at some stage next year that the market will come under pressure again . "

although prices are falling as a multiple of average earnings , the average cost of a house is more than five times that of an average salary .
households are more vulnerable to rising interest rates than in a long while richard jeffrey , bridgewell securities bank keeps rates at 4.75 % " without demand waning i can not see property prices going to crash and it does n't seem that demand is waning , " says helen adams , of firstrungnow , a property website aimed at first-time buyers .
" people are going to have to look at more innovative ownership schemes and financing options to buy their first home . "
dose of reality house prices have risen in each of the past nine years .
should they fall in 2005 , as is possible , it will be a shock to people accustomed to their investments gaining in value .
many homeowners will also be keeping their fingers firmly crossed that the rate of borrowing does not rise any further .
" there is no doubt households are more vulnerable to rising interest rates than in a long while due to the high level of indebtedness , " says richard jeffrey , head of research at bridgewell securities .
increased activity in the housing market allied to rising inflationary pressures could yet put more upwards pressure on rates , mr jeffrey warns .
" the higher interest rates go the less likely the housing market will remain completely unaffected .
" i do n't think that is on the cards this year but it is possible at some stage next year that the market will come under pressure again . "

more than 100 dentists from countryside areas will use a conference in powys to explore how to deal with intimidating patients and the pressures of the job .
the conference at gregynog will recognise that dentistry can be stressful for both staff and patients , said organiser charles vaughan-jones .
the british dental association said violence was an increasing problem . "
we are recognising that - surprise , surprise - it 's not just patients who get anxious , but everyone " dr charles vaughan-jones dr vaughan-jones said professionals dealing with the public such as police and paramedics faced everything from assault to low-level aggression , and dentists in rural areas were no exception .
" this year 's conference is about the anxieties and feelings of the dental team and the patients and what your legal rights are if this tips into aggression , " he said .
" we are recognising that - surprise , surprise - it 's not just patients who get anxious , but everyone . "
fears and phobias event speakers will include hypnotherapists anthony asquith and andrew cain , of london-based fear free dentistry , who use techniques to deal with fears and phobias .
the conference is not , however , scheduled to discuss the shortage of dentists - and particularly in rural areas - which has been frequently in the headlines .
dr vaughan-jones said the aim was instead to discuss day-to-day concerns of the profession .
a shortage of nhs dentists in rural wales in particular has forced some patients to travel far for treatment .
hundreds of people have also queued in some towns for hours to secure a place on nhs dentists ' lists .
the welsh assembly government has also announced an extra £ 5m to help keep dentists in the nhs .
safety concerns the british dental association said it took the issue of violence very seriously .
" dentists and their staff have the right to a working environment free of intimidation where they can treat patients without concerns about their safety , " said a spokesman .
the conference is hosted by the welsh rural postgraduate unit , a partnership between the institute of rural health and cardiff university 's school of postgraduate medical and dental education .
other speakers include antony townsend , chief executive of the general dental council , and pam swain , chief executive of the british association of dental nurses .

" i think it 's very appropriate .
we 're friends , he 's gotten his award here , and it 's kind of fun to get it from a friend .

actors from the original star wars film paid tribute to the director " i 'm not ready yet ... wait until i 'm over 60 .
then i 'll do it , " he told the afi 's board of trustees .
" as soon as i turned 60 , they called me . "
aside from the star wars series , mr lucas wrote and produced the indiana jones films and his visual effects company , industrial light and magic , has helped revolutionise special effects .
he said he was " starting a new career " , referring to his decision to return to his roots and produce smaller , more experimental films .
' personal ' " so it 's kind of the perfect time , probably as good as it 's going to get in terms of being successful . "
mr lucas is currently working on the fourth indiana jones film with mr spielberg .
" i think it 's very appropriate .
we 're friends , he 's gotten his award here , and it 's kind of fun to get it from a friend .
it makes it more of a personal kind of award . "
the afi 's highest award was established in 1973 and last year 's winner was actress meryl streep .

kent police said they can not prosecute the owner of the dog that attacked 11-year-old dean hicks because the animal was on private property .
dean , from dunkirk drive , chatham , had a gaping wound in his side after the attack in a friend 's garden .
" if you keep a staffordshire bull terrier you have to keep that dog under restraint , " said his mother gillian .
" if you have got a dog that is going to run out of the house and attack a child you need to be capable of controlling that dog .
" it is dangerous - it should n't be allowed , " said mrs hicks .
dean needed hospital treatment and time off school while the wound healed .
he remembers the incident clearly .
dean was left with a gaping wound in his stomach " the dog was on my shoulders and as i managed to get it off it took a chunk out of my side , " he said .
if dean had been attacked on the street , the dangerous dogs act of 1991 would apply .
a criminal prosecution would be possible against the owner which might result in an order to destroy the dog .
as the attack was in a private garden , the dogs act of 1871 applies and it is a civil matter .
in this case , the owner of the dog had it destroyed voluntarily .
" we have paid £ 55 to have the dog put down and cremated , " said penelope archer , the owner 's sister .
" it was all very hard for my sister .
she is distraught over this . "

kent police said they can not prosecute the owner of the dog that attacked 11-year-old dean hicks because the animal was on private property .
dean , from dunkirk drive , chatham , had a gaping wound in his side after the attack in a friend 's garden .
" if you keep a staffordshire bull terrier you have to keep that dog under restraint , " said his mother gillian .
" if you have got a dog that is going to run out of the house and attack a child you need to be capable of controlling that dog .
" it is dangerous - it should n't be allowed , " said mrs hicks .
dean needed hospital treatment and time off school while the wound healed .
he remembers the incident clearly .
dean was left with a gaping wound in his stomach " the dog was on my shoulders and as i managed to get it off it took a chunk out of my side , " he said .
if dean had been attacked on the street , the dangerous dogs act of 1991 would apply .
a criminal prosecution would be possible against the owner which might result in an order to destroy the dog .
as the attack was in a private garden , the dogs act of 1871 applies and it is a civil matter .
in this case , the owner of the dog had it destroyed voluntarily .
" we have paid £ 55 to have the dog put down and cremated , " said penelope archer , the owner 's sister .
" it was all very hard for my sister .

here , student naomi yeshuv , who lives in the israeli city of tel aviv , talks about a night out with her friends .
tel aviv 's nightclubs have been a target for suicide bombers i 'm 18-years-old , and i 'm here in tel aviv living and learning and having fun .
tonight we 're going to a club - a nice club - called the move .
it 's beside the sea and you can see the ships and all the little boats .
it 's really nice , it 's lovely , and you can see the stars .
tel aviv for young people is great because she 's alive in the night .
sometimes i am scared of the bombs , and the people that come to the area with knives .
these days we have a lot of incidents with knives and death .
but i decide for myself because i need to get on with my life .
peace i am scared of the bombs , but i do n't really think that a person or a palestinian man could put a bomb in a club , because there 's a whole load of people watching every step that you take .
but knives and fights are everywhere .
and i am scared .
it 's a bit scary to go out at night when you do n't know if you 'll make it home or not .
if we 're having fun and palestinians are crying in the night then i do n't know what we 're living for i think the conflict between the israelis and palestinians is really stupid .
people need peace , not do bad things to each other .
i think that we only need to live with each other and have a good party with each other .
but each side has problems that we need to solve - we hate them and they hate us , and no-one is the good person in the end .
but we need to solve this thing .
i hope that palestinians my age are having fun like us .
if it is only us who are having fun then i do n't know why we 're having this war .
we need to have peace on both sides .
if we 're having fun and they 're crying in the night then i do n't know what we 're living for .

here , student naomi yeshuv , who lives in the israeli city of tel aviv , talks about a night out with her friends .
tel aviv 's nightclubs have been a target for suicide bombers i 'm 18-years-old , and i 'm here in tel aviv living and learning and having fun .
tonight we 're going to a club - a nice club - called the move .
it 's beside the sea and you can see the ships and all the little boats .
it 's really nice , it 's lovely , and you can see the stars .
tel aviv for young people is great because she 's alive in the night .
sometimes i am scared of the bombs , and the people that come to the area with knives .
these days we have a lot of incidents with knives and death .
but i decide for myself because i need to get on with my life .
peace i am scared of the bombs , but i do n't really think that a person or a palestinian man could put a bomb in a club , because there 's a whole load of people watching every step that you take .
but knives and fights are everywhere .
and i am scared .
it 's a bit scary to go out at night when you do n't know if you 'll make it home or not .
if we 're having fun and palestinians are crying in the night then i do n't know what we 're living for i think the conflict between the israelis and palestinians is really stupid .
people need peace , not do bad things to each other .
i think that we only need to live with each other and have a good party with each other .
but each side has problems that we need to solve - we hate them and they hate us , and no-one is the good person in the end .
but we need to solve this thing .
i hope that palestinians my age are having fun like us .
if it is only us who are having fun then i do n't know why we 're having this war .
we need to have peace on both sides .
if we 're having fun and they 're crying in the night then i do n't know what we 're living for .

the report by halifax home insurance also found the uk is more neighbourly than it was five years ago .
scotland scored 100 points out of a maximum 121 on the so-called neighbourliness barometer , which marked regions on 11 categories .
the lowest score was recorded in the north east of england , which clocked 41 points , and london came second to last with only 46 points .
vicky emmott , senior research manager at halifax home insurance , said : " we looked at factors such as strength of friendship with neighbours , the extent to which we would seek advice from neighbours , the sense of safety and security within neighbourhoods and a variety of other measures . "
what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them " peter marsh social issues research centre " we then rated each region based on the responses and from this were able to create a map of british neighbourliness which represents a fascinating insight into community relations in britain today . "
the research also reveals nearly 13.1 million people would count neighbours as close friends , with 42 % socialising with them regularly .
more than half of those surveyed -lrb- 53 % -rrb- admitted their neighbours were their lifeline if they found themselves locked out without a key .
peter marsh of the social issues research centre , who analysed the results of the study , said : " this research shows that britain remains a neighbourly country , despite gloomy prognoses to the contrary .
good friends " what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them .
" our cities , towns and lifestyles may have changed quite markedly over the past century , or even the past decade , but our need to be part of a community remains . "
for people of retirement age , neighbours tended to also be good friends with whom they socialise .
younger people , on the other hand , tended to distinguish between neighbours and their main circle of friends .
they socialised much less frequently with people in the immediate vicinity , according to the report , which questioned 1,000 adults about their relationships with their neighbours .
your comments " sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe " duncan , stockholm , sweden my father was scottish , and i am a british citizen .
my wife is from brazil , we have two young children , we live in stockholm sweden and i am planning for us to move from here , because sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe .
we have almost no social contact , and employment is next to impossible for foreigners here .
i am eager to learn as much as possible about conditions in britain before returning .
i have been expatriate for most of my life , so i am grateful for any information concerning life and work in various parts of britain .
duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden my neighbour fixed my car for me when i was out at work yesterday .
the coolant pipes were leaking and needed replaced .
he built me a full new system using copper pipes that he had bent and welded into shape .
had it fitted in my car for me by the time i got home .
must have taken him hours .
then all he would take was the £ 10 to cover the parts he used and the transmission fluid he went and bought .
top bloke !
david , falkirk , scotland i was brought up in the north of scotland and spent 10 years in edinburgh before moving to london .
people in the north of scotland and edinburgh tended to be very clicky although not necessarily unfriendly .
here people accept you as you are and are generally happy to make conversation that does n't centre around your family background .
fiona , london we are moving from edinburgh to glasgow next year due to career changes .
i have to say that the neighbours we have , are stand-offish in the extreme !
we had both couples over -lrb- with their kids -rrb- last summer and spent a lot of money on a delicious spread .
we have only just been invited back by one couple this weekend - but the other lot walk past with their noses in the air or only look if they are forced to .
me and my husband have been told that glasgow neighbours are amongst the friendliest in the world - they ca n't be any worse than what we have got at the moment !
georgina , edinburgh i am pleased to hear that " sense of community " is still important in the world .
as a canadian i look forward to visiting " neighbourly scotland " in the near future .
ps canadians are friendly too !
denise lauinger , vancouver , canada when i lived in glasgow , scotland , we had the best neighbours you could ask for and we still keep in touch after 38 years .
i lived in toronto , canada , for 24 years and my neighbours were polite and considerate , but not close .
i have now lived in memphis for 15 years and i find that they really have southern hospitality , our neighbours are terrific .
ken baigrie , memphis , united states " my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom " michael robertson , aberdeen i live in flats in aberdeen .
i 'm a student so spend a lot of time in the flat working , however , the only time i hear my neighbours is them leaving to go to work in the morning and returning at night , no one really talks to each other .
however , my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom .
michael robertson , aberdeen it seems there is an urban v. suburban / rural divide on neighbourliness .
i did n't know my neighbours in los angeles until the northridge earthquake of 1994 .
it is probably the hustle and bustle , more transient nature of urban life nowadays , and the " do n't get involved and do n't talk to strangers " mentality , that reduces neighbourliness .
in the 7 years i lived in manhattan , i found that neighbourliness began with me .
when i moved into my flat , the fellow tenants in on the floor of my apartment building there all knew and liked each other .
for a couple of years we joked about having a " neighbourhood association " for our floor alone .
but , now after 7 years we mostly all live elsewhere .
is that sad or just the transient nature of urban life in places like london , new york , los angeles and probably other major cities around the world ?
dan , santa monica , california , usa friendly neighbours london ?
you must be joking !
my 5 year old nephew fell off his bike and was lying on the floor crying his eyes out , the guy who lives down the road walked past him !
kam , london my job took me from edinburgh to london 5 years ago where i have found a huge contrast in neighbourliness .
london has to be the only place in the world where you can stand on a train platform with 500 other people and still hear a pin drop .
nobody speaks to each other and making eye contact is simply not done .
this is the problem with a transient community , nobody thinks they 'll be here long-term so they do n't make the effort .
the suburban areas -lrb- richmond , kingston etc -rrb- are better but still nowhere close to edinburgh .
sarah , richmond , london i think londoners are getting a bit of a raw deal here .
i lived in london -lrb- north and south of the river -rrb- for many years , and always had nice friendly neighbours !
annia , uk my neighbour recently cut my fence in half with a chainsaw , and throws cigarette ends and half eaten food and other rubbish into my garden .
does anyone in scotland fancy a house swap ?
david , yorkshire i 've lived in my rented flat for seven months now , and i do n't even know what most of my neighbours look like .
mark , carshalton , surrey local social contacts generally come through children or household members being at home all day .
living alone and working full time my social circle is built through common interests rather than physical proximity .
peter , bucks , uk i was brilliant friends with all my neighbours and we never had any trouble with boisterous parties or loud music because all the neighbours were invited .
elstow in bedfordshire is one of the friendliest , prettiest and most community minded places in england .
i wish i had n't had to leave .
at least i 'm still in touch with three or four households still and count them as some of my closest friends .
angela , wgc , herts " i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london " john graham , london i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london , all my neighbours are great and good friends , always speak and say hi and its a friendly area overall , and we have a council that appreciates us and works for us not against us john graham , london a few years ago i fainted on the street in scotland , having tried to run up a hill too fast after giving blood .
coming round , i was dimly aware of cars stopping and people gathering round to see if i was ok .
someone recognised me and three women grabbed a limb each to bundle me into a car and take me home .
they delivered me to my family -lrb- still very woozy -rrb- and off they went .
if i fainted in the road here in surrey , no one would stop in case i was drunk or trying a ruse to rob them - and if they did stop , it would be to kick me or steal my handbag !
kh , surrey - formerly east lothian , scotland i recently moved to wigan from scotland .
i have found it extremely unfriendly and unwelcoming , people tend to put their heads down when they pass rather look at you .
the neighbours barely notice you are alive and i doubt they would even recognise me as being a neighbour .
the neighbourhood i used to live in , in the north of scotland was brilliant , everyone was warm , helpful always popping round for coffee and a chat .
i could rely on them for anything i would regard the majority of my x-neighbours as close friends who still keep in contact with me now .
pamela , wigan , lancs most of our neighbours in our glasgow tenement are perfectly considerate , decent people who are glad to help each other out .
however , it only takes one bad apple to spoil things .
in our case , our downstairs ' neighbours ' have spent well over two years trying to convert an office into two flats .
during this time , we have been subjected to every kind of disruption imaginable , particularly noise and dust , and the odd bit of damage to our own property .
the prolonged disruption has pretty much wrecked my health - there ca n't be too many people who go to work to relax .
as far as un-neighbourly behaviour goes , i 've never encountered anything remotely like it , and i 've spent most of my life as a tenement-dweller ...
ag , glasgow , scotland i have lived in a block of flats in north london for about 10 months now and i have only met 2 of my neighbours !
it would seem hardly anyone talks to anyone else , i only met one of my neighbours when he came up to tell us to make less noise .
my parents on the other hand live just outside north-west london and they have a really nice community feel , the whole street do things together on a regular basis .
as , london , uk i 've lived in south east london all my life , and moved further south 13 years ago , the people that are still living here from i have arrived are lovely people who you can count on if needed but the new younger people who are moving in are unfriendly to the point of ignoring our good mornings !
making me miss the people who have moved away even more .
tracie d , south east london a few years ago i decided to retire to falkirk in scotland close to where i was born .
i was shocked by the bigotry i encountered and was delighted to be offered employment back in england where i now live happily and have no intention of repeating the experience .
andrew marshall , farnham i disagree about young people being unsociable .
i am 21 and visit neighbours who range from 19-65 and we always have a good laugh no matter the age .
bad times and good times are shared alike .
house parties tend to end up being street parties and if you need a shoulder to cry on there 's no shortage .
they 're as good as family and i would n't change that for anything .
gillian , falkirk , scotland until recently a quiet area , neighbourly but unobtrusively so , everyone ready to look out for and help each other without interfering .
however , as much new housing is being stuffed into the area we are trying to be optimistic that this will continue .
jude b , sarisbury green , fareham , england i think this is accurate enough - in edinburgh a sizable population live in ' tenement style ' flats , with a communal stair-well .
of the people i know who also live in tenements , nearly all keep a key with a neighbour .
people also look out for each other , for instance in the case of security , if someone were to break in then all neighbours are roughly equally at risk .
i would also agree that people -lrb- younger people -rrb- tend not to socialise with neighbours , although it 's fairly common for neighbours in the stairwell to invite you if they are holding a party , out of courtesy , and in the hope that they will be more lenient if it gets noisy .
i 've certainly done it myself and had other people do it to me .
michael talker , edinburgh , uk it is in rural and coastal towns , where tourism is key , that you will find a lot of rude and ignorant neighbours .
many of them are " townies " who have bought holiday homes , either using them at weekends , or renting them out .
people just turn up for their holiday , not considering the fact that we live next door .
they do n't care about noise , where they park , or being courteous .
they can walk away from the place and leave us to pick up the pieces from having nights of disturbed sleep , from being the recipients of nasty comments and from dreading the thought of who is going to turn up next .
no , i should not have to accept it just because of where i live .
by the way , the rest of my neighbours are fine .
richard , highcliffe , dorset i have been living in hamilton , scotland for the last year having moved here from redhill , surrey .
although scots are very friendly people as i have experienced during my time here , but the neighbourhood where i live is n't as friendly as a scottish neighbourhood should be .
the most you get to hear from anyone around here is a hiya and that 's it .
they do n't even care to exchange proper greetings .
all the neighbours around here are so cold and distant .
they do n't live up to the standard of the friendly scottish people i have normally found on the streets .
mrs khan , lanark , lanarkshire we live in a quiet little road and have an excellent sense of community here .
i would not want to live anywhere else and having london 's biggest park on your doorstep is wonderful .
paul middleton , kingston-upon-thames uk fourteen years ago we had just moved to cornwall and my wife had to go into hospital , parents of other children in my daughter 's class arranged for my son to be looked after in the morning , both children to be looked after when school finished .
i did not know these people , my wife had had " time of day " chats with them .
their neighbourly attitude , kindness and consideration will stay with me always .
this was just a single example of the neighbours who were exceptionally kind and supportive during our 12 year stay in cornwall .
ian greenhill , northampton , england i live in a fairly busy road in windsor , where most of the residents work full time so do n't see each other too much .
despite this there , is a sense of community and just a simple " good morning " seems to promote the feeling of belonging .
i know that most of us would gladly step in , if any of our neighbours needed our help , whether it be to water their plants or to sign for an expected delivery .
the british often receive bad press for their cool demeanour but i would say that in my experience , the majority of the people in this country are very decent folk with a good sense of neighbourliness !
helen , windsor , uk very neighbourly area .
on a walk up to the village main street many people will say hello as they pass .
shop staff are friendly and like a chat .
the four houses in close proximity to my home all take their share at house-sitting when someone is on holiday .
on bin day , if someone is at home during the day , they will bring in the other neighbours ' bins and will also take in deliveries for if you know you 're not going to be around to get them .
all in all it 's a great little place to live .
helen ternent , dalry , north ayrshire , scotland very good neighbours .
could n't wish for better .
janet smith , inverness , scotland my father was scottish , and i am a british citizen .
my wife is from brazil , we have two young children , and i am planning to move from here , because sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe .
we have almost no social contact , and employment is next to impossible for foreigners here .
i am eager to learn as much as possible about conditions in britain before returning .
duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden " you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are " sandy mutch , dundee having lived all over scotland , the friendliest places i 've stayed in is dundee - and that 's why i 'm not moving .
in the three houses i 've had in dundee , i 've benefited form all sorts of kindness and regard .
i 've been being taken out for a welcome pint , lent all sorts of gardening tools , gotten help with my car when it needed fixing and , when my mum who 's 82 comes to stay , the neighbours pop in and take her a cake or a magazine while i 'm at work .
but it 's often just a cheery ' hello ' or ' how are you doing ' that makes me feel like this is home .
i have to say , i think you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are and i like to think i look out for them and i 'm there for them when they need me .
sandy mutch , dundee i have lived in a number of urban and rural areas during my life .
but never , ever , have i encountered a people so neighbourly and friendly as here in islay .
perhaps the whisky helps ?
prof apm coxon , port ellen -lrb- islay -rrb- scotland our neighbours are brilliant .
we lend each other tools , take in parcels for each other , mow each others lawns etc .
if i am away , i will give my keys to my neighbours to pop in and out of the house to feed the cats .
we look out for each other !
paul , wales when i lived in north wales i knew all my neighbours by name , we would all have a drink together of an evening and chat over the fence or wave across the street .
if someone needed a hand then everyone else would pitch in and help out .
since moving to leicestershire , i have no idea who my neighbours are , although the older folks seem willing to have a chat ; the younger people do n't want to know you .

duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden my neighbour fixed my car for me when i was out at work yesterday .
the coolant pipes were leaking and needed replaced .
he built me a full new system using copper pipes that he had bent and welded into shape .
had it fitted in my car for me by the time i got home .
must have taken him hours .
then all he would take was the £ 10 to cover the parts he used and the transmission fluid he went and bought .
top bloke !
david , falkirk , scotland i was brought up in the north of scotland and spent 10 years in edinburgh before moving to london .
people in the north of scotland and edinburgh tended to be very clicky although not necessarily unfriendly .
here people accept you as you are and are generally happy to make conversation that does n't centre around your family background .
fiona , london we are moving from edinburgh to glasgow next year due to career changes .
i have to say that the neighbours we have , are stand-offish in the extreme !
we had both couples over -lrb- with their kids -rrb- last summer and spent a lot of money on a delicious spread .
we have only just been invited back by one couple this weekend - but the other lot walk past with their noses in the air or only look if they are forced to .
me and my husband have been told that glasgow neighbours are amongst the friendliest in the world - they ca n't be any worse than what we have got at the moment !
georgina , edinburgh i am pleased to hear that " sense of community " is still important in the world .
as a canadian i look forward to visiting " neighbourly scotland " in the near future .
ps canadians are friendly too !
denise lauinger , vancouver , canada when i lived in glasgow , scotland , we had the best neighbours you could ask for and we still keep in touch after 38 years .
i lived in toronto , canada , for 24 years and my neighbours were polite and considerate , but not close .
i have now lived in memphis for 15 years and i find that they really have southern hospitality , our neighbours are terrific .
ken baigrie , memphis , united states my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom michael robertson , aberdeen i live in flats in aberdeen .
i 'm a student so spend a lot of time in the flat working , however , the only time i hear my neighbours is them leaving to go to work in the morning and returning at night , no one really talks to each other .
however , my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom .
michael robertson , aberdeen it seems there is an urban v. suburban / rural divide on neighbourliness .
i did n't know my neighbours in los angeles until the northridge earthquake of 1994 .
it is probably the hustle and bustle , more transient nature of urban life nowadays , and the " do n't get involved and do n't talk to strangers " mentality , that reduces neighbourliness .
in the 7 years i lived in manhattan , i found that neighbourliness began with me .
when i moved into my flat , the fellow tenants in on the floor of my apartment building there all knew and liked each other .
for a couple of years we joked about having a " neighbourhood association " for our floor alone .
but , now after 7 years we mostly all live elsewhere .
is that sad or just the transient nature of urban life in places like london , new york , los angeles and probably other major cities around the world ?
dan , santa monica , california , usa friendly neighbours london ?
you must be joking !
my 5 year old nephew fell off his bike and was lying on the floor crying his eyes out , the guy who lives down the road walked past him !
kam , london my job took me from edinburgh to london 5 years ago where i have found a huge contrast in neighbourliness .
london has to be the only place in the world where you can stand on a train platform with 500 other people and still hear a pin drop .
nobody speaks to each other and making eye contact is simply not done .
this is the problem with a transient community , nobody thinks they 'll be here long-term so they do n't make the effort .
the suburban areas -lrb- richmond , kingston etc -rrb- are better but still nowhere close to edinburgh .
sarah , richmond , london i think londoners are getting a bit of a raw deal here .
i lived in london -lrb- north and south of the river -rrb- for many years , and always had nice friendly neighbours !
annia , uk my neighbour recently cut my fence in half with a chainsaw , and throws cigarette ends and half eaten food and other rubbish into my garden .
does anyone in scotland fancy a house swap ?
david , yorkshire i 've lived in my rented flat for seven months now , and i do n't even know what most of my neighbours look like .
mark , carshalton , surrey local social contacts generally come through children or household members being at home all day .
living alone and working full time my social circle is built through common interests rather than physical proximity .
peter , bucks , uk i was brilliant friends with all my neighbours and we never had any trouble with boisterous parties or loud music because all the neighbours were invited .
elstow in bedfordshire is one of the friendliest , prettiest and most community minded places in england .
i wish i had n't had to leave .
at least i 'm still in touch with three or four households still and count them as some of my closest friends .
angela , wgc , herts i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london john graham , london i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london , all my neighbours are great and good friends , always speak and say hi and its a friendly area overall , and we have a council that appreciates us and works for us not against us john graham , london a few years ago i fainted on the street in scotland , having tried to run up a hill too fast after giving blood .
coming round , i was dimly aware of cars stopping and people gathering round to see if i was ok .
someone recognised me and three women grabbed a limb each to bundle me into a car and take me home .
they delivered me to my family -lrb- still very woozy -rrb- and off they went .
if i fainted in the road here in surrey , no one would stop in case i was drunk or trying a ruse to rob them - and if they did stop , it would be to kick me or steal my handbag !
kh , surrey - formerly east lothian , scotland i recently moved to wigan from scotland .
i have found it extremely unfriendly and unwelcoming , people tend to put their heads down when they pass rather look at you .
the neighbours barely notice you are alive and i doubt they would even recognise me as being a neighbour .
the neighbourhood i used to live in , in the north of scotland was brilliant , everyone was warm , helpful always popping round for coffee and a chat .
i could rely on them for anything i would regard the majority of my x-neighbours as close friends who still keep in contact with me now .
pamela , wigan , lancs most of our neighbours in our glasgow tenement are perfectly considerate , decent people who are glad to help each other out .
however , it only takes one bad apple to spoil things .
in our case , our downstairs ' neighbours ' have spent well over two years trying to convert an office into two flats .
during this time , we have been subjected to every kind of disruption imaginable , particularly noise and dust , and the odd bit of damage to our own property .
the prolonged disruption has pretty much wrecked my health - there ca n't be too many people who go to work to relax .
as far as un-neighbourly behaviour goes , i 've never encountered anything remotely like it , and i 've spent most of my life as a tenement-dweller ...
ag , glasgow , scotland i have lived in a block of flats in north london for about 10 months now and i have only met 2 of my neighbours !
it would seem hardly anyone talks to anyone else , i only met one of my neighbours when he came up to tell us to make less noise .
my parents on the other hand live just outside north-west london and they have a really nice community feel , the whole street do things together on a regular basis .
as , london , uk i 've lived in south east london all my life , and moved further south 13 years ago , the people that are still living here from i have arrived are lovely people who you can count on if needed but the new younger people who are moving in are unfriendly to the point of ignoring our good mornings !
making me miss the people who have moved away even more .
tracie d , south east london a few years ago i decided to retire to falkirk in scotland close to where i was born .
i was shocked by the bigotry i encountered and was delighted to be offered employment back in england where i now live happily and have no intention of repeating the experience .
andrew marshall , farnham i disagree about young people being unsociable .
i am 21 and visit neighbours who range from 19-65 and we always have a good laugh no matter the age .
bad times and good times are shared alike .
house parties tend to end up being street parties and if you need a shoulder to cry on there 's no shortage .
they 're as good as family and i would n't change that for anything .
gillian , falkirk , scotland until recently a quiet area , neighbourly but unobtrusively so , everyone ready to look out for and help each other without interfering .
however , as much new housing is being stuffed into the area we are trying to be optimistic that this will continue .
jude b , sarisbury green , fareham , england i think this is accurate enough - in edinburgh a sizable population live in ' tenement style ' flats , with a communal stair-well .
of the people i know who also live in tenements , nearly all keep a key with a neighbour .
people also look out for each other , for instance in the case of security , if someone were to break in then all neighbours are roughly equally at risk .
i would also agree that people -lrb- younger people -rrb- tend not to socialise with neighbours , although it 's fairly common for neighbours in the stairwell to invite you if they are holding a party , out of courtesy , and in the hope that they will be more lenient if it gets noisy .
i 've certainly done it myself and had other people do it to me .
michael talker , edinburgh , uk it is in rural and coastal towns , where tourism is key , that you will find a lot of rude and ignorant neighbours .
many of them are " townies " who have bought holiday homes , either using them at weekends , or renting them out .
people just turn up for their holiday , not considering the fact that we live next door .
they do n't care about noise , where they park , or being courteous .
they can walk away from the place and leave us to pick up the pieces from having nights of disturbed sleep , from being the recipients of nasty comments and from dreading the thought of who is going to turn up next .
no , i should not have to accept it just because of where i live .
by the way , the rest of my neighbours are fine .
richard , highcliffe , dorset i have been living in hamilton , scotland for the last year having moved here from redhill , surrey .
although scots are very friendly people as i have experienced during my time here , but the neighbourhood where i live is n't as friendly as a scottish neighbourhood should be .
the most you get to hear from anyone around here is a hiya and that 's it .
they do n't even care to exchange proper greetings .
all the neighbours around here are so cold and distant .
they do n't live up to the standard of the friendly scottish people i have normally found on the streets .
mrs khan , lanark , lanarkshire we live in a quiet little road and have an excellent sense of community here .
i would not want to live anywhere else and having london 's biggest park on your doorstep is wonderful .
paul middleton , kingston-upon-thames uk fourteen years ago we had just moved to cornwall and my wife had to go into hospital , parents of other children in my daughter 's class arranged for my son to be looked after in the morning , both children to be looked after when school finished .
i did not know these people , my wife had had " time of day " chats with them .
their neighbourly attitude , kindness and consideration will stay with me always .
this was just a single example of the neighbours who were exceptionally kind and supportive during our 12 year stay in cornwall .
ian greenhill , northampton , england i live in a fairly busy road in windsor , where most of the residents work full time so do n't see each other too much .
despite this there , is a sense of community and just a simple " good morning " seems to promote the feeling of belonging .
i know that most of us would gladly step in , if any of our neighbours needed our help , whether it be to water their plants or to sign for an expected delivery .
the british often receive bad press for their cool demeanour but i would say that in my experience , the majority of the people in this country are very decent folk with a good sense of neighbourliness !
helen , windsor , uk very neighbourly area .
on a walk up to the village main street many people will say hello as they pass .
shop staff are friendly and like a chat .
the four houses in close proximity to my home all take their share at house-sitting when someone is on holiday .
on bin day , if someone is at home during the day , they will bring in the other neighbours ' bins and will also take in deliveries for if you know you 're not going to be around to get them .
all in all it 's a great little place to live .
helen ternent , dalry , north ayrshire , scotland very good neighbours .
could n't wish for better .
janet smith , inverness , scotland my father was scottish , and i am a british citizen .
my wife is from brazil , we have two young children , and i am planning to move from here , because sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe .
we have almost no social contact , and employment is next to impossible for foreigners here .
i am eager to learn as much as possible about conditions in britain before returning .
duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are sandy mutch , dundee having lived all over scotland , the friendliest places i 've stayed in is dundee - and that 's why i 'm not moving .
in the three houses i 've had in dundee , i 've benefited form all sorts of kindness and regard .
i 've been being taken out for a welcome pint , lent all sorts of gardening tools , gotten help with my car when it needed fixing and , when my mum who 's 82 comes to stay , the neighbours pop in and take her a cake or a magazine while i 'm at work .
but it 's often just a cheery ' hello ' or ' how are you doing ' that makes me feel like this is home .
i have to say , i think you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are and i like to think i look out for them and i 'm there for them when they need me .
sandy mutch , dundee i have lived in a number of urban and rural areas during my life .
but never , ever , have i encountered a people so neighbourly and friendly as here in islay .
perhaps the whisky helps ?
prof apm coxon , port ellen -lrb- islay -rrb- scotland our neighbours are brilliant .
we lend each other tools , take in parcels for each other , mow each others lawns etc .
if i am away , i will give my keys to my neighbours to pop in and out of the house to feed the cats .
we look out for each other !
paul , wales when i lived in north wales i knew all my neighbours by name , we would all have a drink together of an evening and chat over the fence or wave across the street .
if someone needed a hand then everyone else would pitch in and help out .
since moving to leicestershire , i have no idea who my neighbours are , although the older folks seem willing to have a chat ; the younger people do n't want to know you .

the report by halifax home insurance also found the uk is more neighbourly than it was five years ago .
scotland scored 100 points out of a maximum 121 on the so-called neighbourliness barometer , which marked regions on 11 categories .
the lowest score was recorded in the north east of england , which clocked 41 points , and london came second to last with only 46 points .
vicky emmott , senior research manager at halifax home insurance , said : " we looked at factors such as strength of friendship with neighbours , the extent to which we would seek advice from neighbours , the sense of safety and security within neighbourhoods and a variety of other measures .
what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them peter marsh social issues research centre " we then rated each region based on the responses and from this were able to create a map of british neighbourliness which represents a fascinating insight into community relations in britain today . "
the research also reveals nearly 13.1 million people would count neighbours as close friends , with 42 % socialising with them regularly .
more than half of those surveyed -lrb- 53 % -rrb- admitted their neighbours were their lifeline if they found themselves locked out without a key .
peter marsh of the social issues research centre , who analysed the results of the study , said : " this research shows that britain remains a neighbourly country , despite gloomy prognoses to the contrary .
good friends " what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them .
" our cities , towns and lifestyles may have changed quite markedly over the past century , or even the past decade , but our need to be part of a community remains . "
for people of retirement age , neighbours tended to also be good friends with whom they socialise .
younger people , on the other hand , tended to distinguish between neighbours and their main circle of friends .
they socialised much less frequently with people in the immediate vicinity , according to the report , which questioned 1,000 adults about their relationships with their neighbours .

on bin day , if someone is at home during the day , they will bring in the other neighbours ' bins and will also take in deliveries for if you know you 're not going to be around to get them .
all in all it 's a great little place to live .
helen ternent , dalry , north ayrshire , scotland very good neighbours .
could n't wish for better .
janet smith , inverness , scotland my father was scottish , and i am a british citizen .
my wife is from brazil , we have two young children , and i am planning to move from here , because sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe .
we have almost no social contact , and employment is next to impossible for foreigners here .
i am eager to learn as much as possible about conditions in britain before returning .
duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are sandy mutch , dundee having lived all over scotland , the friendliest places i 've stayed in is dundee - and that 's why i 'm not moving .
in the three houses i 've had in dundee , i 've benefited form all sorts of kindness and regard .
i 've been being taken out for a welcome pint , lent all sorts of gardening tools , gotten help with my car when it needed fixing and , when my mum who 's 82 comes to stay , the neighbours pop in and take her a cake or a magazine while i 'm at work .
but it 's often just a cheery ' hello ' or ' how are you doing ' that makes me feel like this is home .
i have to say , i think you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are and i like to think i look out for them and i 'm there for them when they need me .
sandy mutch , dundee i have lived in a number of urban and rural areas during my life .
but never , ever , have i encountered a people so neighbourly and friendly as here in islay .
perhaps the whisky helps ?
prof apm coxon , port ellen -lrb- islay -rrb- scotland our neighbours are brilliant .
we lend each other tools , take in parcels for each other , mow each others lawns etc .
if i am away , i will give my keys to my neighbours to pop in and out of the house to feed the cats .
we look out for each other !
paul , wales when i lived in north wales i knew all my neighbours by name , we would all have a drink together of an evening and chat over the fence or wave across the street .
if someone needed a hand then everyone else would pitch in and help out .
since moving to leicestershire , i have no idea who my neighbours are , although the older folks seem willing to have a chat ; the younger people do n't want to know you .

the report by halifax home insurance also found the uk is more neighbourly than it was five years ago .
scotland scored 100 points out of a maximum 121 on the so-called neighbourliness barometer , which marked regions on 11 categories .
the lowest score was recorded in the north east of england , which clocked 41 points , and london came second to last with only 46 points .
vicky emmott , senior research manager at halifax home insurance , said : " we looked at factors such as strength of friendship with neighbours , the extent to which we would seek advice from neighbours , the sense of safety and security within neighbourhoods and a variety of other measures .
what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them peter marsh social issues research centre " we then rated each region based on the responses and from this were able to create a map of british neighbourliness which represents a fascinating insight into community relations in britain today . "
the research also reveals nearly 13.1 million people would count neighbours as close friends , with 42 % socialising with them regularly .
more than half of those surveyed -lrb- 53 % -rrb- admitted their neighbours were their lifeline if they found themselves locked out without a key .
peter marsh of the social issues research centre , who analysed the results of the study , said : " this research shows that britain remains a neighbourly country , despite gloomy prognoses to the contrary .
good friends " what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them .
" our cities , towns and lifestyles may have changed quite markedly over the past century , or even the past decade , but our need to be part of a community remains . "
for people of retirement age , neighbours tended to also be good friends with whom they socialise .
younger people , on the other hand , tended to distinguish between neighbours and their main circle of friends .
they socialised much less frequently with people in the immediate vicinity , according to the report , which questioned 1,000 adults about their relationships with their neighbours .

top bloke !
david , falkirk , scotland i was brought up in the north of scotland and spent 10 years in edinburgh before moving to london .
people in the north of scotland and edinburgh tended to be very clicky although not necessarily unfriendly .
here people accept you as you are and are generally happy to make conversation that does n't centre around your family background .
fiona , london we are moving from edinburgh to glasgow next year due to career changes .
i have to say that the neighbours we have , are stand-offish in the extreme !
we had both couples over -lrb- with their kids -rrb- last summer and spent a lot of money on a delicious spread .
we have only just been invited back by one couple this weekend - but the other lot walk past with their noses in the air or only look if they are forced to .
me and my husband have been told that glasgow neighbours are amongst the friendliest in the world - they ca n't be any worse than what we have got at the moment !
georgina , edinburgh i am pleased to hear that " sense of community " is still important in the world .
as a canadian i look forward to visiting " neighbourly scotland " in the near future .
ps canadians are friendly too !
denise lauinger , vancouver , canada when i lived in glasgow , scotland , we had the best neighbours you could ask for and we still keep in touch after 38 years .
i lived in toronto , canada , for 24 years and my neighbours were polite and considerate , but not close .
i have now lived in memphis for 15 years and i find that they really have southern hospitality , our neighbours are terrific .
ken baigrie , memphis , united states my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom michael robertson , aberdeen i live in flats in aberdeen .
i 'm a student so spend a lot of time in the flat working , however , the only time i hear my neighbours is them leaving to go to work in the morning and returning at night , no one really talks to each other .
however , my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom .
michael robertson , aberdeen it seems there is an urban v. suburban / rural divide on neighbourliness .
i did n't know my neighbours in los angeles until the northridge earthquake of 1994 .
it is probably the hustle and bustle , more transient nature of urban life nowadays , and the " do n't get involved and do n't talk to strangers " mentality , that reduces neighbourliness .
in the 7 years i lived in manhattan , i found that neighbourliness began with me .
when i moved into my flat , the fellow tenants in on the floor of my apartment building there all knew and liked each other .
for a couple of years we joked about having a " neighbourhood association " for our floor alone .
but , now after 7 years we mostly all live elsewhere .
is that sad or just the transient nature of urban life in places like london , new york , los angeles and probably other major cities around the world ?
dan , santa monica , california , usa friendly neighbours london ?
you must be joking !
my 5 year old nephew fell off his bike and was lying on the floor crying his eyes out , the guy who lives down the road walked past him !
kam , london my job took me from edinburgh to london 5 years ago where i have found a huge contrast in neighbourliness .
london has to be the only place in the world where you can stand on a train platform with 500 other people and still hear a pin drop .
nobody speaks to each other and making eye contact is simply not done .
this is the problem with a transient community , nobody thinks they 'll be here long-term so they do n't make the effort .
the suburban areas -lrb- richmond , kingston etc -rrb- are better but still nowhere close to edinburgh .
sarah , richmond , london i think londoners are getting a bit of a raw deal here .
i lived in london -lrb- north and south of the river -rrb- for many years , and always had nice friendly neighbours !
annia , uk my neighbour recently cut my fence in half with a chainsaw , and throws cigarette ends and half eaten food and other rubbish into my garden .
does anyone in scotland fancy a house swap ?
david , yorkshire i 've lived in my rented flat for seven months now , and i do n't even know what most of my neighbours look like .
mark , carshalton , surrey local social contacts generally come through children or household members being at home all day .
living alone and working full time my social circle is built through common interests rather than physical proximity .
peter , bucks , uk i was brilliant friends with all my neighbours and we never had any trouble with boisterous parties or loud music because all the neighbours were invited .
elstow in bedfordshire is one of the friendliest , prettiest and most community minded places in england .
i wish i had n't had to leave .
at least i 'm still in touch with three or four households still and count them as some of my closest friends .
angela , wgc , herts i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london john graham , london i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london , all my neighbours are great and good friends , always speak and say hi and its a friendly area overall , and we have a council that appreciates us and works for us not against us john graham , london a few years ago i fainted on the street in scotland , having tried to run up a hill too fast after giving blood .
coming round , i was dimly aware of cars stopping and people gathering round to see if i was ok .
someone recognised me and three women grabbed a limb each to bundle me into a car and take me home .
they delivered me to my family -lrb- still very woozy -rrb- and off they went .
if i fainted in the road here in surrey , no one would stop in case i was drunk or trying a ruse to rob them - and if they did stop , it would be to kick me or steal my handbag !
kh , surrey - formerly east lothian , scotland i recently moved to wigan from scotland .
i have found it extremely unfriendly and unwelcoming , people tend to put their heads down when they pass rather look at you .
the neighbours barely notice you are alive and i doubt they would even recognise me as being a neighbour .
the neighbourhood i used to live in , in the north of scotland was brilliant , everyone was warm , helpful always popping round for coffee and a chat .
i could rely on them for anything i would regard the majority of my x-neighbours as close friends who still keep in contact with me now .
pamela , wigan , lancs most of our neighbours in our glasgow tenement are perfectly considerate , decent people who are glad to help each other out .
however , it only takes one bad apple to spoil things .
in our case , our downstairs ' neighbours ' have spent well over two years trying to convert an office into two flats .
during this time , we have been subjected to every kind of disruption imaginable , particularly noise and dust , and the odd bit of damage to our own property .
the prolonged disruption has pretty much wrecked my health - there ca n't be too many people who go to work to relax .
as far as un-neighbourly behaviour goes , i 've never encountered anything remotely like it , and i 've spent most of my life as a tenement-dweller ...
ag , glasgow , scotland i have lived in a block of flats in north london for about 10 months now and i have only met 2 of my neighbours !
it would seem hardly anyone talks to anyone else , i only met one of my neighbours when he came up to tell us to make less noise .
my parents on the other hand live just outside north-west london and they have a really nice community feel , the whole street do things together on a regular basis .
as , london , uk i 've lived in south east london all my life , and moved further south 13 years ago , the people that are still living here from i have arrived are lovely people who you can count on if needed but the new younger people who are moving in are unfriendly to the point of ignoring our good mornings !
making me miss the people who have moved away even more .
tracie d , south east london a few years ago i decided to retire to falkirk in scotland close to where i was born .
i was shocked by the bigotry i encountered and was delighted to be offered employment back in england where i now live happily and have no intention of repeating the experience .
andrew marshall , farnham i disagree about young people being unsociable .
i am 21 and visit neighbours who range from 19-65 and we always have a good laugh no matter the age .
bad times and good times are shared alike .
house parties tend to end up being street parties and if you need a shoulder to cry on there 's no shortage .
they 're as good as family and i would n't change that for anything .
gillian , falkirk , scotland until recently a quiet area , neighbourly but unobtrusively so , everyone ready to look out for and help each other without interfering .
however , as much new housing is being stuffed into the area we are trying to be optimistic that this will continue .
jude b , sarisbury green , fareham , england i think this is accurate enough - in edinburgh a sizable population live in ' tenement style ' flats , with a communal stair-well .
of the people i know who also live in tenements , nearly all keep a key with a neighbour .
people also look out for each other , for instance in the case of security , if someone were to break in then all neighbours are roughly equally at risk .
i would also agree that people -lrb- younger people -rrb- tend not to socialise with neighbours , although it 's fairly common for neighbours in the stairwell to invite you if they are holding a party , out of courtesy , and in the hope that they will be more lenient if it gets noisy .
i 've certainly done it myself and had other people do it to me .
michael talker , edinburgh , uk it is in rural and coastal towns , where tourism is key , that you will find a lot of rude and ignorant neighbours .
many of them are " townies " who have bought holiday homes , either using them at weekends , or renting them out .
people just turn up for their holiday , not considering the fact that we live next door .
they do n't care about noise , where they park , or being courteous .
they can walk away from the place and leave us to pick up the pieces from having nights of disturbed sleep , from being the recipients of nasty comments and from dreading the thought of who is going to turn up next .
no , i should not have to accept it just because of where i live .
by the way , the rest of my neighbours are fine .
richard , highcliffe , dorset i have been living in hamilton , scotland for the last year having moved here from redhill , surrey .
although scots are very friendly people as i have experienced during my time here , but the neighbourhood where i live is n't as friendly as a scottish neighbourhood should be .
the most you get to hear from anyone around here is a hiya and that 's it .
they do n't even care to exchange proper greetings .
all the neighbours around here are so cold and distant .
they do n't live up to the standard of the friendly scottish people i have normally found on the streets .
mrs khan , lanark , lanarkshire we live in a quiet little road and have an excellent sense of community here .
i would not want to live anywhere else and having london 's biggest park on your doorstep is wonderful .
paul middleton , kingston-upon-thames uk fourteen years ago we had just moved to cornwall and my wife had to go into hospital , parents of other children in my daughter 's class arranged for my son to be looked after in the morning , both children to be looked after when school finished .
i did not know these people , my wife had had " time of day " chats with them .
their neighbourly attitude , kindness and consideration will stay with me always .
this was just a single example of the neighbours who were exceptionally kind and supportive during our 12 year stay in cornwall .
ian greenhill , northampton , england i live in a fairly busy road in windsor , where most of the residents work full time so do n't see each other too much .
despite this there , is a sense of community and just a simple " good morning " seems to promote the feeling of belonging .
i know that most of us would gladly step in , if any of our neighbours needed our help , whether it be to water their plants or to sign for an expected delivery .
the british often receive bad press for their cool demeanour but i would say that in my experience , the majority of the people in this country are very decent folk with a good sense of neighbourliness !
helen , windsor , uk very neighbourly area .
on a walk up to the village main street many people will say hello as they pass .
shop staff are friendly and like a chat .
the four houses in close proximity to my home all take their share at house-sitting when someone is on holiday .
on bin day , if someone is at home during the day , they will bring in the other neighbours ' bins and will also take in deliveries for if you know you 're not going to be around to get them .
all in all it 's a great little place to live .
helen ternent , dalry , north ayrshire , scotland very good neighbours .
could n't wish for better .
janet smith , inverness , scotland my father was scottish , and i am a british citizen .

angela , wgc , herts i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london john graham , london i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london , all my neighbours are great and good friends , always speak and say hi and its a friendly area overall , and we have a council that appreciates us and works for us not against us john graham , london a few years ago i fainted on the street in scotland , having tried to run up a hill too fast after giving blood .
coming round , i was dimly aware of cars stopping and people gathering round to see if i was ok .
someone recognised me and three women grabbed a limb each to bundle me into a car and take me home .
they delivered me to my family -lrb- still very woozy -rrb- and off they went .
if i fainted in the road here in surrey , no one would stop in case i was drunk or trying a ruse to rob them - and if they did stop , it would be to kick me or steal my handbag !
kh , surrey - formerly east lothian , scotland i recently moved to wigan from scotland .
i have found it extremely unfriendly and unwelcoming , people tend to put their heads down when they pass rather look at you .
the neighbours barely notice you are alive and i doubt they would even recognise me as being a neighbour .
the neighbourhood i used to live in , in the north of scotland was brilliant , everyone was warm , helpful always popping round for coffee and a chat .
i could rely on them for anything i would regard the majority of my x-neighbours as close friends who still keep in contact with me now .
pamela , wigan , lancs most of our neighbours in our glasgow tenement are perfectly considerate , decent people who are glad to help each other out .
however , it only takes one bad apple to spoil things .
in our case , our downstairs ' neighbours ' have spent well over two years trying to convert an office into two flats .
during this time , we have been subjected to every kind of disruption imaginable , particularly noise and dust , and the odd bit of damage to our own property .
the prolonged disruption has pretty much wrecked my health - there ca n't be too many people who go to work to relax .
as far as un-neighbourly behaviour goes , i 've never encountered anything remotely like it , and i 've spent most of my life as a tenement-dweller ...
ag , glasgow , scotland i have lived in a block of flats in north london for about 10 months now and i have only met 2 of my neighbours !
it would seem hardly anyone talks to anyone else , i only met one of my neighbours when he came up to tell us to make less noise .
my parents on the other hand live just outside north-west london and they have a really nice community feel , the whole street do things together on a regular basis .
as , london , uk i 've lived in south east london all my life , and moved further south 13 years ago , the people that are still living here from i have arrived are lovely people who you can count on if needed but the new younger people who are moving in are unfriendly to the point of ignoring our good mornings !
making me miss the people who have moved away even more .
tracie d , south east london a few years ago i decided to retire to falkirk in scotland close to where i was born .
i was shocked by the bigotry i encountered and was delighted to be offered employment back in england where i now live happily and have no intention of repeating the experience .
andrew marshall , farnham i disagree about young people being unsociable .
i am 21 and visit neighbours who range from 19-65 and we always have a good laugh no matter the age .
bad times and good times are shared alike .
house parties tend to end up being street parties and if you need a shoulder to cry on there 's no shortage .
they 're as good as family and i would n't change that for anything .
gillian , falkirk , scotland until recently a quiet area , neighbourly but unobtrusively so , everyone ready to look out for and help each other without interfering .
however , as much new housing is being stuffed into the area we are trying to be optimistic that this will continue .
jude b , sarisbury green , fareham , england i think this is accurate enough - in edinburgh a sizable population live in ' tenement style ' flats , with a communal stair-well .
of the people i know who also live in tenements , nearly all keep a key with a neighbour .
people also look out for each other , for instance in the case of security , if someone were to break in then all neighbours are roughly equally at risk .
i would also agree that people -lrb- younger people -rrb- tend not to socialise with neighbours , although it 's fairly common for neighbours in the stairwell to invite you if they are holding a party , out of courtesy , and in the hope that they will be more lenient if it gets noisy .
i 've certainly done it myself and had other people do it to me .
michael talker , edinburgh , uk it is in rural and coastal towns , where tourism is key , that you will find a lot of rude and ignorant neighbours .
many of them are " townies " who have bought holiday homes , either using them at weekends , or renting them out .
people just turn up for their holiday , not considering the fact that we live next door .
they do n't care about noise , where they park , or being courteous .
they can walk away from the place and leave us to pick up the pieces from having nights of disturbed sleep , from being the recipients of nasty comments and from dreading the thought of who is going to turn up next .
no , i should not have to accept it just because of where i live .
by the way , the rest of my neighbours are fine .
richard , highcliffe , dorset i have been living in hamilton , scotland for the last year having moved here from redhill , surrey .
although scots are very friendly people as i have experienced during my time here , but the neighbourhood where i live is n't as friendly as a scottish neighbourhood should be .
the most you get to hear from anyone around here is a hiya and that 's it .
they do n't even care to exchange proper greetings .
all the neighbours around here are so cold and distant .
they do n't live up to the standard of the friendly scottish people i have normally found on the streets .
mrs khan , lanark , lanarkshire we live in a quiet little road and have an excellent sense of community here .
i would not want to live anywhere else and having london 's biggest park on your doorstep is wonderful .
paul middleton , kingston-upon-thames uk fourteen years ago we had just moved to cornwall and my wife had to go into hospital , parents of other children in my daughter 's class arranged for my son to be looked after in the morning , both children to be looked after when school finished .
i did not know these people , my wife had had " time of day " chats with them .
their neighbourly attitude , kindness and consideration will stay with me always .
this was just a single example of the neighbours who were exceptionally kind and supportive during our 12 year stay in cornwall .
ian greenhill , northampton , england i live in a fairly busy road in windsor , where most of the residents work full time so do n't see each other too much .
despite this there , is a sense of community and just a simple " good morning " seems to promote the feeling of belonging .
i know that most of us would gladly step in , if any of our neighbours needed our help , whether it be to water their plants or to sign for an expected delivery .
the british often receive bad press for their cool demeanour but i would say that in my experience , the majority of the people in this country are very decent folk with a good sense of neighbourliness !
helen , windsor , uk very neighbourly area .
on a walk up to the village main street many people will say hello as they pass .
shop staff are friendly and like a chat .
the four houses in close proximity to my home all take their share at house-sitting when someone is on holiday .
on bin day , if someone is at home during the day , they will bring in the other neighbours ' bins and will also take in deliveries for if you know you 're not going to be around to get them .
all in all it 's a great little place to live .
helen ternent , dalry , north ayrshire , scotland very good neighbours .
could n't wish for better .
janet smith , inverness , scotland my father was scottish , and i am a british citizen .
my wife is from brazil , we have two young children , and i am planning to move from here , because sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe .
we have almost no social contact , and employment is next to impossible for foreigners here .
i am eager to learn as much as possible about conditions in britain before returning .
duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are sandy mutch , dundee having lived all over scotland , the friendliest places i 've stayed in is dundee - and that 's why i 'm not moving .
in the three houses i 've had in dundee , i 've benefited form all sorts of kindness and regard .
i 've been being taken out for a welcome pint , lent all sorts of gardening tools , gotten help with my car when it needed fixing and , when my mum who 's 82 comes to stay , the neighbours pop in and take her a cake or a magazine while i 'm at work .
but it 's often just a cheery ' hello ' or ' how are you doing ' that makes me feel like this is home .
i have to say , i think you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are and i like to think i look out for them and i 'm there for them when they need me .
sandy mutch , dundee i have lived in a number of urban and rural areas during my life .
but never , ever , have i encountered a people so neighbourly and friendly as here in islay .
perhaps the whisky helps ?
prof apm coxon , port ellen -lrb- islay -rrb- scotland our neighbours are brilliant .
we lend each other tools , take in parcels for each other , mow each others lawns etc .
if i am away , i will give my keys to my neighbours to pop in and out of the house to feed the cats .
we look out for each other !
paul , wales when i lived in north wales i knew all my neighbours by name , we would all have a drink together of an evening and chat over the fence or wave across the street .
if someone needed a hand then everyone else would pitch in and help out .
since moving to leicestershire , i have no idea who my neighbours are , although the older folks seem willing to have a chat ; the younger people do n't want to know you .

the report by halifax home insurance also found the uk is more neighbourly than it was five years ago .
scotland scored 100 points out of a maximum 121 on the so-called neighbourliness barometer , which marked regions on 11 categories .
the lowest score was recorded in the north east of england , which clocked 41 points , and london came second to last with only 46 points .
vicky emmott , senior research manager at halifax home insurance , said : " we looked at factors such as strength of friendship with neighbours , the extent to which we would seek advice from neighbours , the sense of safety and security within neighbourhoods and a variety of other measures .
what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them peter marsh social issues research centre " we then rated each region based on the responses and from this were able to create a map of british neighbourliness which represents a fascinating insight into community relations in britain today . "
the research also reveals nearly 13.1 million people would count neighbours as close friends , with 42 % socialising with them regularly .
more than half of those surveyed -lrb- 53 % -rrb- admitted their neighbours were their lifeline if they found themselves locked out without a key .
peter marsh of the social issues research centre , who analysed the results of the study , said : " this research shows that britain remains a neighbourly country , despite gloomy prognoses to the contrary .
good friends " what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them .
" our cities , towns and lifestyles may have changed quite markedly over the past century , or even the past decade , but our need to be part of a community remains . "
for people of retirement age , neighbours tended to also be good friends with whom they socialise .
younger people , on the other hand , tended to distinguish between neighbours and their main circle of friends .
they socialised much less frequently with people in the immediate vicinity , according to the report , which questioned 1,000 adults about their relationships with their neighbours .

i have been expatriate for most of my life , so i am grateful for any information concerning life and work in various parts of britain .
duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden my neighbour fixed my car for me when i was out at work yesterday .
the coolant pipes were leaking and needed replaced .
he built me a full new system using copper pipes that he had bent and welded into shape .
had it fitted in my car for me by the time i got home .
must have taken him hours .
then all he would take was the £ 10 to cover the parts he used and the transmission fluid he went and bought .
top bloke !
david , falkirk , scotland i was brought up in the north of scotland and spent 10 years in edinburgh before moving to london .
people in the north of scotland and edinburgh tended to be very clicky although not necessarily unfriendly .
here people accept you as you are and are generally happy to make conversation that does n't centre around your family background .
fiona , london we are moving from edinburgh to glasgow next year due to career changes .
i have to say that the neighbours we have , are stand-offish in the extreme !
we had both couples over -lrb- with their kids -rrb- last summer and spent a lot of money on a delicious spread .
we have only just been invited back by one couple this weekend - but the other lot walk past with their noses in the air or only look if they are forced to .
me and my husband have been told that glasgow neighbours are amongst the friendliest in the world - they ca n't be any worse than what we have got at the moment !
georgina , edinburgh i am pleased to hear that " sense of community " is still important in the world .
as a canadian i look forward to visiting " neighbourly scotland " in the near future .
ps canadians are friendly too !
denise lauinger , vancouver , canada when i lived in glasgow , scotland , we had the best neighbours you could ask for and we still keep in touch after 38 years .
i lived in toronto , canada , for 24 years and my neighbours were polite and considerate , but not close .
i have now lived in memphis for 15 years and i find that they really have southern hospitality , our neighbours are terrific .
ken baigrie , memphis , united states my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom michael robertson , aberdeen i live in flats in aberdeen .
i 'm a student so spend a lot of time in the flat working , however , the only time i hear my neighbours is them leaving to go to work in the morning and returning at night , no one really talks to each other .
however , my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom .
michael robertson , aberdeen it seems there is an urban v. suburban / rural divide on neighbourliness .
i did n't know my neighbours in los angeles until the northridge earthquake of 1994 .
it is probably the hustle and bustle , more transient nature of urban life nowadays , and the " do n't get involved and do n't talk to strangers " mentality , that reduces neighbourliness .
in the 7 years i lived in manhattan , i found that neighbourliness began with me .
when i moved into my flat , the fellow tenants in on the floor of my apartment building there all knew and liked each other .
for a couple of years we joked about having a " neighbourhood association " for our floor alone .
but , now after 7 years we mostly all live elsewhere .
is that sad or just the transient nature of urban life in places like london , new york , los angeles and probably other major cities around the world ?
dan , santa monica , california , usa friendly neighbours london ?
you must be joking !
my 5 year old nephew fell off his bike and was lying on the floor crying his eyes out , the guy who lives down the road walked past him !
kam , london my job took me from edinburgh to london 5 years ago where i have found a huge contrast in neighbourliness .
london has to be the only place in the world where you can stand on a train platform with 500 other people and still hear a pin drop .
nobody speaks to each other and making eye contact is simply not done .
this is the problem with a transient community , nobody thinks they 'll be here long-term so they do n't make the effort .
the suburban areas -lrb- richmond , kingston etc -rrb- are better but still nowhere close to edinburgh .
sarah , richmond , london i think londoners are getting a bit of a raw deal here .
i lived in london -lrb- north and south of the river -rrb- for many years , and always had nice friendly neighbours !
annia , uk my neighbour recently cut my fence in half with a chainsaw , and throws cigarette ends and half eaten food and other rubbish into my garden .
does anyone in scotland fancy a house swap ?
david , yorkshire i 've lived in my rented flat for seven months now , and i do n't even know what most of my neighbours look like .
mark , carshalton , surrey local social contacts generally come through children or household members being at home all day .
living alone and working full time my social circle is built through common interests rather than physical proximity .
peter , bucks , uk i was brilliant friends with all my neighbours and we never had any trouble with boisterous parties or loud music because all the neighbours were invited .
elstow in bedfordshire is one of the friendliest , prettiest and most community minded places in england .
i wish i had n't had to leave .
at least i 'm still in touch with three or four households still and count them as some of my closest friends .

vicky emmott , senior research manager at halifax home insurance , said : " we looked at factors such as strength of friendship with neighbours , the extent to which we would seek advice from neighbours , the sense of safety and security within neighbourhoods and a variety of other measures .
what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them peter marsh social issues research centre " we then rated each region based on the responses and from this were able to create a map of british neighbourliness which represents a fascinating insight into community relations in britain today . "
the research also reveals nearly 13.1 million people would count neighbours as close friends , with 42 % socialising with them regularly .
more than half of those surveyed -lrb- 53 % -rrb- admitted their neighbours were their lifeline if they found themselves locked out without a key .
peter marsh of the social issues research centre , who analysed the results of the study , said : " this research shows that britain remains a neighbourly country , despite gloomy prognoses to the contrary .
good friends " what the results reflect is the enduring human need for a sense of belonging with others around them .
" our cities , towns and lifestyles may have changed quite markedly over the past century , or even the past decade , but our need to be part of a community remains . "
for people of retirement age , neighbours tended to also be good friends with whom they socialise .
younger people , on the other hand , tended to distinguish between neighbours and their main circle of friends .
they socialised much less frequently with people in the immediate vicinity , according to the report , which questioned 1,000 adults about their relationships with their neighbours .
your comments sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe duncan , stockholm , sweden my father was scottish , and i am a british citizen .
my wife is from brazil , we have two young children , we live in stockholm sweden and i am planning for us to move from here , because sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe .
we have almost no social contact , and employment is next to impossible for foreigners here .
i am eager to learn as much as possible about conditions in britain before returning .
i have been expatriate for most of my life , so i am grateful for any information concerning life and work in various parts of britain .
duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden my neighbour fixed my car for me when i was out at work yesterday .
the coolant pipes were leaking and needed replaced .
he built me a full new system using copper pipes that he had bent and welded into shape .
had it fitted in my car for me by the time i got home .
must have taken him hours .
then all he would take was the £ 10 to cover the parts he used and the transmission fluid he went and bought .
top bloke !
david , falkirk , scotland i was brought up in the north of scotland and spent 10 years in edinburgh before moving to london .
people in the north of scotland and edinburgh tended to be very clicky although not necessarily unfriendly .
here people accept you as you are and are generally happy to make conversation that does n't centre around your family background .
fiona , london we are moving from edinburgh to glasgow next year due to career changes .
i have to say that the neighbours we have , are stand-offish in the extreme !
we had both couples over -lrb- with their kids -rrb- last summer and spent a lot of money on a delicious spread .
we have only just been invited back by one couple this weekend - but the other lot walk past with their noses in the air or only look if they are forced to .
me and my husband have been told that glasgow neighbours are amongst the friendliest in the world - they ca n't be any worse than what we have got at the moment !
georgina , edinburgh i am pleased to hear that " sense of community " is still important in the world .
as a canadian i look forward to visiting " neighbourly scotland " in the near future .
ps canadians are friendly too !
denise lauinger , vancouver , canada when i lived in glasgow , scotland , we had the best neighbours you could ask for and we still keep in touch after 38 years .
i lived in toronto , canada , for 24 years and my neighbours were polite and considerate , but not close .
i have now lived in memphis for 15 years and i find that they really have southern hospitality , our neighbours are terrific .
ken baigrie , memphis , united states my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom michael robertson , aberdeen i live in flats in aberdeen .
i 'm a student so spend a lot of time in the flat working , however , the only time i hear my neighbours is them leaving to go to work in the morning and returning at night , no one really talks to each other .
however , my old street in dunfermline was very friendly and was very much like a sitcom .
michael robertson , aberdeen it seems there is an urban v. suburban / rural divide on neighbourliness .
i did n't know my neighbours in los angeles until the northridge earthquake of 1994 .
it is probably the hustle and bustle , more transient nature of urban life nowadays , and the " do n't get involved and do n't talk to strangers " mentality , that reduces neighbourliness .
in the 7 years i lived in manhattan , i found that neighbourliness began with me .
when i moved into my flat , the fellow tenants in on the floor of my apartment building there all knew and liked each other .
for a couple of years we joked about having a " neighbourhood association " for our floor alone .
but , now after 7 years we mostly all live elsewhere .
is that sad or just the transient nature of urban life in places like london , new york , los angeles and probably other major cities around the world ?
dan , santa monica , california , usa friendly neighbours london ?
you must be joking !
my 5 year old nephew fell off his bike and was lying on the floor crying his eyes out , the guy who lives down the road walked past him !
kam , london my job took me from edinburgh to london 5 years ago where i have found a huge contrast in neighbourliness .
london has to be the only place in the world where you can stand on a train platform with 500 other people and still hear a pin drop .
nobody speaks to each other and making eye contact is simply not done .
this is the problem with a transient community , nobody thinks they 'll be here long-term so they do n't make the effort .
the suburban areas -lrb- richmond , kingston etc -rrb- are better but still nowhere close to edinburgh .
sarah , richmond , london i think londoners are getting a bit of a raw deal here .
i lived in london -lrb- north and south of the river -rrb- for many years , and always had nice friendly neighbours !
annia , uk my neighbour recently cut my fence in half with a chainsaw , and throws cigarette ends and half eaten food and other rubbish into my garden .
does anyone in scotland fancy a house swap ?
david , yorkshire i 've lived in my rented flat for seven months now , and i do n't even know what most of my neighbours look like .
mark , carshalton , surrey local social contacts generally come through children or household members being at home all day .
living alone and working full time my social circle is built through common interests rather than physical proximity .
peter , bucks , uk i was brilliant friends with all my neighbours and we never had any trouble with boisterous parties or loud music because all the neighbours were invited .
elstow in bedfordshire is one of the friendliest , prettiest and most community minded places in england .
i wish i had n't had to leave .
at least i 'm still in touch with three or four households still and count them as some of my closest friends .
angela , wgc , herts i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london john graham , london i live in catford which has always been the butt of many jokes for years , it is however one of the most neighbourly boroughs in london , all my neighbours are great and good friends , always speak and say hi and its a friendly area overall , and we have a council that appreciates us and works for us not against us john graham , london a few years ago i fainted on the street in scotland , having tried to run up a hill too fast after giving blood .
coming round , i was dimly aware of cars stopping and people gathering round to see if i was ok .
someone recognised me and three women grabbed a limb each to bundle me into a car and take me home .
they delivered me to my family -lrb- still very woozy -rrb- and off they went .
if i fainted in the road here in surrey , no one would stop in case i was drunk or trying a ruse to rob them - and if they did stop , it would be to kick me or steal my handbag !
kh , surrey - formerly east lothian , scotland i recently moved to wigan from scotland .
i have found it extremely unfriendly and unwelcoming , people tend to put their heads down when they pass rather look at you .
the neighbours barely notice you are alive and i doubt they would even recognise me as being a neighbour .
the neighbourhood i used to live in , in the north of scotland was brilliant , everyone was warm , helpful always popping round for coffee and a chat .
i could rely on them for anything i would regard the majority of my x-neighbours as close friends who still keep in contact with me now .
pamela , wigan , lancs most of our neighbours in our glasgow tenement are perfectly considerate , decent people who are glad to help each other out .
however , it only takes one bad apple to spoil things .
in our case , our downstairs ' neighbours ' have spent well over two years trying to convert an office into two flats .
during this time , we have been subjected to every kind of disruption imaginable , particularly noise and dust , and the odd bit of damage to our own property .
the prolonged disruption has pretty much wrecked my health - there ca n't be too many people who go to work to relax .
as far as un-neighbourly behaviour goes , i 've never encountered anything remotely like it , and i 've spent most of my life as a tenement-dweller ...
ag , glasgow , scotland i have lived in a block of flats in north london for about 10 months now and i have only met 2 of my neighbours !
it would seem hardly anyone talks to anyone else , i only met one of my neighbours when he came up to tell us to make less noise .
my parents on the other hand live just outside north-west london and they have a really nice community feel , the whole street do things together on a regular basis .
as , london , uk i 've lived in south east london all my life , and moved further south 13 years ago , the people that are still living here from i have arrived are lovely people who you can count on if needed but the new younger people who are moving in are unfriendly to the point of ignoring our good mornings !
making me miss the people who have moved away even more .
tracie d , south east london a few years ago i decided to retire to falkirk in scotland close to where i was born .
i was shocked by the bigotry i encountered and was delighted to be offered employment back in england where i now live happily and have no intention of repeating the experience .
andrew marshall , farnham i disagree about young people being unsociable .
i am 21 and visit neighbours who range from 19-65 and we always have a good laugh no matter the age .
bad times and good times are shared alike .
house parties tend to end up being street parties and if you need a shoulder to cry on there 's no shortage .
they 're as good as family and i would n't change that for anything .
gillian , falkirk , scotland until recently a quiet area , neighbourly but unobtrusively so , everyone ready to look out for and help each other without interfering .
however , as much new housing is being stuffed into the area we are trying to be optimistic that this will continue .
jude b , sarisbury green , fareham , england i think this is accurate enough - in edinburgh a sizable population live in ' tenement style ' flats , with a communal stair-well .
of the people i know who also live in tenements , nearly all keep a key with a neighbour .
people also look out for each other , for instance in the case of security , if someone were to break in then all neighbours are roughly equally at risk .
i would also agree that people -lrb- younger people -rrb- tend not to socialise with neighbours , although it 's fairly common for neighbours in the stairwell to invite you if they are holding a party , out of courtesy , and in the hope that they will be more lenient if it gets noisy .
i 've certainly done it myself and had other people do it to me .
michael talker , edinburgh , uk it is in rural and coastal towns , where tourism is key , that you will find a lot of rude and ignorant neighbours .
many of them are " townies " who have bought holiday homes , either using them at weekends , or renting them out .
people just turn up for their holiday , not considering the fact that we live next door .
they do n't care about noise , where they park , or being courteous .
they can walk away from the place and leave us to pick up the pieces from having nights of disturbed sleep , from being the recipients of nasty comments and from dreading the thought of who is going to turn up next .
no , i should not have to accept it just because of where i live .
by the way , the rest of my neighbours are fine .
richard , highcliffe , dorset i have been living in hamilton , scotland for the last year having moved here from redhill , surrey .
although scots are very friendly people as i have experienced during my time here , but the neighbourhood where i live is n't as friendly as a scottish neighbourhood should be .
the most you get to hear from anyone around here is a hiya and that 's it .
they do n't even care to exchange proper greetings .
all the neighbours around here are so cold and distant .
they do n't live up to the standard of the friendly scottish people i have normally found on the streets .
mrs khan , lanark , lanarkshire we live in a quiet little road and have an excellent sense of community here .
i would not want to live anywhere else and having london 's biggest park on your doorstep is wonderful .
paul middleton , kingston-upon-thames uk fourteen years ago we had just moved to cornwall and my wife had to go into hospital , parents of other children in my daughter 's class arranged for my son to be looked after in the morning , both children to be looked after when school finished .
i did not know these people , my wife had had " time of day " chats with them .
their neighbourly attitude , kindness and consideration will stay with me always .
this was just a single example of the neighbours who were exceptionally kind and supportive during our 12 year stay in cornwall .
ian greenhill , northampton , england i live in a fairly busy road in windsor , where most of the residents work full time so do n't see each other too much .
despite this there , is a sense of community and just a simple " good morning " seems to promote the feeling of belonging .
i know that most of us would gladly step in , if any of our neighbours needed our help , whether it be to water their plants or to sign for an expected delivery .
the british often receive bad press for their cool demeanour but i would say that in my experience , the majority of the people in this country are very decent folk with a good sense of neighbourliness !
helen , windsor , uk very neighbourly area .
on a walk up to the village main street many people will say hello as they pass .
shop staff are friendly and like a chat .
the four houses in close proximity to my home all take their share at house-sitting when someone is on holiday .
on bin day , if someone is at home during the day , they will bring in the other neighbours ' bins and will also take in deliveries for if you know you 're not going to be around to get them .
all in all it 's a great little place to live .
helen ternent , dalry , north ayrshire , scotland very good neighbours .
could n't wish for better .
janet smith , inverness , scotland my father was scottish , and i am a british citizen .
my wife is from brazil , we have two young children , and i am planning to move from here , because sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe .
we have almost no social contact , and employment is next to impossible for foreigners here .
i am eager to learn as much as possible about conditions in britain before returning .
duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are sandy mutch , dundee having lived all over scotland , the friendliest places i 've stayed in is dundee - and that 's why i 'm not moving .
in the three houses i 've had in dundee , i 've benefited form all sorts of kindness and regard .
i 've been being taken out for a welcome pint , lent all sorts of gardening tools , gotten help with my car when it needed fixing and , when my mum who 's 82 comes to stay , the neighbours pop in and take her a cake or a magazine while i 'm at work .
but it 's often just a cheery ' hello ' or ' how are you doing ' that makes me feel like this is home .
i have to say , i think you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are and i like to think i look out for them and i 'm there for them when they need me .
sandy mutch , dundee i have lived in a number of urban and rural areas during my life .
but never , ever , have i encountered a people so neighbourly and friendly as here in islay .
perhaps the whisky helps ?
prof apm coxon , port ellen -lrb- islay -rrb- scotland our neighbours are brilliant .
we lend each other tools , take in parcels for each other , mow each others lawns etc .
if i am away , i will give my keys to my neighbours to pop in and out of the house to feed the cats .
we look out for each other !
paul , wales when i lived in north wales i knew all my neighbours by name , we would all have a drink together of an evening and chat over the fence or wave across the street .
if someone needed a hand then everyone else would pitch in and help out .
since moving to leicestershire , i have no idea who my neighbours are , although the older folks seem willing to have a chat ; the younger people do n't want to know you .

richard , highcliffe , dorset i have been living in hamilton , scotland for the last year having moved here from redhill , surrey .
although scots are very friendly people as i have experienced during my time here , but the neighbourhood where i live is n't as friendly as a scottish neighbourhood should be .
the most you get to hear from anyone around here is a hiya and that 's it .
they do n't even care to exchange proper greetings .
all the neighbours around here are so cold and distant .
they do n't live up to the standard of the friendly scottish people i have normally found on the streets .
mrs khan , lanark , lanarkshire we live in a quiet little road and have an excellent sense of community here .
i would not want to live anywhere else and having london 's biggest park on your doorstep is wonderful .
paul middleton , kingston-upon-thames uk fourteen years ago we had just moved to cornwall and my wife had to go into hospital , parents of other children in my daughter 's class arranged for my son to be looked after in the morning , both children to be looked after when school finished .
i did not know these people , my wife had had " time of day " chats with them .
their neighbourly attitude , kindness and consideration will stay with me always .
this was just a single example of the neighbours who were exceptionally kind and supportive during our 12 year stay in cornwall .
ian greenhill , northampton , england i live in a fairly busy road in windsor , where most of the residents work full time so do n't see each other too much .
despite this there , is a sense of community and just a simple " good morning " seems to promote the feeling of belonging .
i know that most of us would gladly step in , if any of our neighbours needed our help , whether it be to water their plants or to sign for an expected delivery .
the british often receive bad press for their cool demeanour but i would say that in my experience , the majority of the people in this country are very decent folk with a good sense of neighbourliness !
helen , windsor , uk very neighbourly area .
on a walk up to the village main street many people will say hello as they pass .
shop staff are friendly and like a chat .
the four houses in close proximity to my home all take their share at house-sitting when someone is on holiday .
on bin day , if someone is at home during the day , they will bring in the other neighbours ' bins and will also take in deliveries for if you know you 're not going to be around to get them .
all in all it 's a great little place to live .
helen ternent , dalry , north ayrshire , scotland very good neighbours .
could n't wish for better .
janet smith , inverness , scotland my father was scottish , and i am a british citizen .
my wife is from brazil , we have two young children , and i am planning to move from here , because sweden has become one of the most intolerant countries in europe .
we have almost no social contact , and employment is next to impossible for foreigners here .
i am eager to learn as much as possible about conditions in britain before returning .
duncan gavin lawson , stockholm , sweden you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are sandy mutch , dundee having lived all over scotland , the friendliest places i 've stayed in is dundee - and that 's why i 'm not moving .
in the three houses i 've had in dundee , i 've benefited form all sorts of kindness and regard .
i 've been being taken out for a welcome pint , lent all sorts of gardening tools , gotten help with my car when it needed fixing and , when my mum who 's 82 comes to stay , the neighbours pop in and take her a cake or a magazine while i 'm at work .
but it 's often just a cheery ' hello ' or ' how are you doing ' that makes me feel like this is home .
i have to say , i think you can only measure your neighbours by how good a neighbour you are and i like to think i look out for them and i 'm there for them when they need me .
sandy mutch , dundee i have lived in a number of urban and rural areas during my life .
but never , ever , have i encountered a people so neighbourly and friendly as here in islay .
perhaps the whisky helps ?
prof apm coxon , port ellen -lrb- islay -rrb- scotland our neighbours are brilliant .
we lend each other tools , take in parcels for each other , mow each others lawns etc .
if i am away , i will give my keys to my neighbours to pop in and out of the house to feed the cats .
we look out for each other !
paul , wales when i lived in north wales i knew all my neighbours by name , we would all have a drink together of an evening and chat over the fence or wave across the street .
if someone needed a hand then everyone else would pitch in and help out .
since moving to leicestershire , i have no idea who my neighbours are , although the older folks seem willing to have a chat ; the younger people do n't want to know you .

the list included uninhabited hebridean islands fuday and sandray , and offshore sites near hunterston and redcar .
other sites were in essex - at bradwell and near southend - stanford , in norfolk , and at sellafield and dounreay nuclear power stations .
the body handling waste says any future sites will be chosen from scratch .
the list was released by nirex , which is responsible for dealing with britain 's intermediate-level nuclear waste .
it was drawn up in the 1980s , but the plan to bury waste at the sites was abandoned following the landslide defeat of mr major 's conservative government in 1997 .
waste is currently stored at more than 30 sites around the country .
sites considered bradwell , essex potton island , essex two sites at sellafield , cumbria dounreay , caithness altnabreac , caithness fuday , hebrides sandray , hebrides killingholme , south humberside stanford , norfolk offshore site near redcar offshore site near hunterston nirex is emphasising that the released list is purely historical and when a decision is made on where to store nuclear waste , the list would not become the starting point of a new exercise .
the issue is sensitive with some energy experts beginning to say that britain can meet pollution targets only if it builds a new generation of nuclear plants .
sellafield favourite one of the sites considered was in essex , at the former ministry of defence facility at potton island , just a few kilometres from the centre of southend .
another was at the former nuclear power station at bradwell .
sellafield remains a favourite , with much nuclear material already there , and the local population seen to be supportive .
two sites at the cumbrian plant are on the list . "
if you are on the old list , you stand a very good chance of being on any new list " rob edwards journalist a site at dounreay nuclear power station presented another while in caithness , a site at altnabreac was discussed .
there has been speculation about stanford in norfolk , where the mod owns land , which is also on the 1980s list .
the current government is looking for a definite solution to nuclear waste storage , and will start from scratch .
its committee on radioactive waste management will report next year but will only give technical specifications , such as whether nuclear waste will be below or above ground and how it will be monitored .
site selection will follow later .
the offshore sites are understood not to be an option now because of changes in the law .
transparency vow chris murray , managing director of nirex , said : " radioactive waste exists and needs to be dealt with whether or not there is any programme of new build in the uk .
" openness and transparency must underpin everything that is done in this area . "
nirex spokesman david wild said it would have broken the law to release the list during the election .
" our legal advice was very clear .
we had to try our best not to damage the future process . "
but rob edwards , a journalist for the new scientist and sunday herald , said : " it 's just a sign of the inherent characteristic secrecy of the whole nuclear operation in the past .
" nirex wanted to keep it out of the general election but they have now agreed and government ministers have agreed . "
he said it was likely that the same sites would feature in any future discussions .
" if you are on the old list , you stand a very good chance of being on any new list . "
friends of the earth 's chief executive , duncan mclaren , said : " the government needs to learn that the best way to begin dealing with the uk 's nuclear waste legacy starts with halting the production of any more waste . "

the list included uninhabited hebridean islands fuday and sandray , and offshore sites near hunterston and redcar .
other sites were in essex - at bradwell and near southend - stanford , in norfolk , and at sellafield and dounreay nuclear power stations .
the body handling waste says any future sites will be chosen from scratch .
the list was released by nirex , which is responsible for dealing with britain 's intermediate-level nuclear waste .
it was drawn up in the 1980s , but the plan to bury waste at the sites was abandoned following the landslide defeat of mr major 's conservative government in 1997 .
waste is currently stored at more than 30 sites around the country .
sites considered bradwell , essex potton island , essex two sites at sellafield , cumbria dounreay , caithness altnabreac , caithness fuday , hebrides sandray , hebrides killingholme , south humberside stanford , norfolk offshore site near redcar offshore site near hunterston nirex is emphasising that the released list is purely historical and when a decision is made on where to store nuclear waste , the list would not become the starting point of a new exercise .
the issue is sensitive with some energy experts beginning to say that britain can meet pollution targets only if it builds a new generation of nuclear plants .
sellafield favourite one of the sites considered was in essex , at the former ministry of defence facility at potton island , just a few kilometres from the centre of southend .
another was at the former nuclear power station at bradwell .
sellafield remains a favourite , with much nuclear material already there , and the local population seen to be supportive .
two sites at the cumbrian plant are on the list .
if you are on the old list , you stand a very good chance of being on any new list rob edwards journalist a site at dounreay nuclear power station presented another while in caithness , a site at altnabreac was discussed .
there has been speculation about stanford in norfolk , where the mod owns land , which is also on the 1980s list .
the current government is looking for a definite solution to nuclear waste storage , and will start from scratch .
its committee on radioactive waste management will report next year but will only give technical specifications , such as whether nuclear waste will be below or above ground and how it will be monitored .
site selection will follow later .
the offshore sites are understood not to be an option now because of changes in the law .
transparency vow chris murray , managing director of nirex , said : " radioactive waste exists and needs to be dealt with whether or not there is any programme of new build in the uk .
" openness and transparency must underpin everything that is done in this area . "
nirex spokesman david wild said it would have broken the law to release the list during the election .
" our legal advice was very clear .
we had to try our best not to damage the future process . "
but rob edwards , a journalist for the new scientist and sunday herald , said : " it 's just a sign of the inherent characteristic secrecy of the whole nuclear operation in the past .
" nirex wanted to keep it out of the general election but they have now agreed and government ministers have agreed . "
he said it was likely that the same sites would feature in any future discussions .
" if you are on the old list , you stand a very good chance of being on any new list . "
friends of the earth 's chief executive , duncan mclaren , said : " the government needs to learn that the best way to begin dealing with the uk 's nuclear waste legacy starts with halting the production of any more waste . "

yeneayhu saw some of his students attacked with gun butts i am running here and there to see what has been going on .
i can see people running away from very well armed police in the distance .
you just have to run , just run .
you have to be really alert as you do n't know what will happen .
simple ordinary victims it is the most terrible thing because the military forces do not speak the same language as us .
they speak the tigrigna language as they are from mekle - the ruling party 's area in the north .
as you ca n't communicate with them , simply ordinary people like me are also victims .
if i tried to explain that i had nothing to do with all of this they would n't be able to understand .
no-one around here can tell them anything .
and so that is why all the people run away as soon as they see them coming .
big clash this morning i saw three people that had been shot dead .
they were picked up by a red cross car .
yeneayhu said people were really fighting the police i had been going to the commercial college , which is near the mercato market in the city .
a lot of people were at the market .
there are no taxis today because of the strike and so no-one was at work .
people had thought that the government would make an announcement in response to the disputed election results , following the past two days of protests .
but instead the mekle had a big clash with the people .
there were no cars as all the ways had been closed with rocks .
people were throwing stones and then the police started really shooting .
gun shots people were really fighting them .
anyone who had been on the street was involved .
have your say when the crowd dispersed in fear , they started shooting at them .
there was blood everywhere yosef , addis ababa send us your comments i was running , just like the others .
but i saw the military people .
they were directly shooting at everyone .
they were aiming right at the people .
it was the worst thing about today 's experience in the city .
this is really the most disastrous thing in my whole life .
uncertainty and tomorrow , from what i have heard , the same thing will happen again .
it will keep happening until the government takes action over the election results .
people want some kind of immediate action .
as of yet though , i have not heard any government body reporting about the situation .
nothing .
if you would like to comment on yeneayhu 's experience please use the form below .
your comments : a ruling party with no intention of giving power , an opposition with no means of support , and international community with no care ...
sef beni amer , addis ababa for the record i support neither the ruling party nor the opposition .
if you allow me , let me give you a somewhat objective view of the circumstances that led to this uncertainty .
in the next few months ethiopia could either be a truly democratic country or a truly chaotic country .
it all depends on how the world reacts .
the last few months , ethiopians have experienced a political freedom never seen before .
however , this freedom has evaporated since the election .
the ruling party truly thought that they would win the election fair and square .
they did not even consider the possibility of losing the election .
on election day , people voted against the ruling party .
the ruling party realized that they lost all the seats in the capital city , they started making sure that one way or the other the votes from rural area favour them .
even though the international observers know for a fact that the election is being manipulated , they are afraid to say the truth because the truth will most likely make ethiopia a chaotic country rather than democratic .
the truth will set you free .
millions around the country are saying , enough is enough and more than a few are giving their life .
a ruling party with no intention of giving power , an opposition with no means of support , and international community with no care ... something tells me that the fortune of ethiopia is going south .
never mind the world , even god has forgotten ethiopia .
the people of ethiopia have spoken .
it 's better to listen now rather than to witness another rwanda .
let us witness another georgia .
another ukraine .
and another ethiopia ?
sef beni amer , addis ababa , ethiopia amongst my friends i was one of few who always insisted in giving the benefit of the doubt to the incumbent prime minister assuming that he will eventually democratize the country .
but after seeing meles 's agazi force on the rampage on unarmed civilian today i believe that meles and his people should be held accountable .
tadesse i just want to thank yeneayhu for letting the rest of the world know what is going on in ethiopia .
masha all of your comments reflect that you are tired of meles 's smartness agazi , addis ababa i have already read yeneayhu 's comment .
do n't take it to the wrong way because i am a tigrian -lrb- as my name indicates -rrb- but to be honest his comment is so disappointing .
it is an ethnic based comment .
all of the militaries are not from the tigray region .
they have also completed at least eighth grade so that means that they can speak the national language amharic .
all of your comments reflect that you are tired of meles 's smartness .
let 's not hide the truth .
the opposition party -lrb- cud -rrb- has announced through pamphlets to gather for a mob which was definitely restricted for a while .
the thing i am telling you is that the mob is not a sudden action that occurred on monday .
my reason / evidence is that my friend 's sister was going to take her exam on monday .
but at the cud meeting on saturday a student told her that she did n't have to worry because there would n't be an exam .
this indicates that the mob was deliberately planned .
please avoid your ethnic reflections .
please just tell the truth .
agazi , addis ababa , ethiopia he was then moved to the detention centre in dover where very concerned prison officers contacted the visitor group marion walter , canterbury i know one asylum seeker from ethiopia very well .
he lived in our house for eight months after eventually been released from detention in this country .
he was arrested and tortured many times from the age of 17 in ethiopia .
finally the police got real evidence of his political activity .
he was away from home when they came to arrest him november 2003 and his wife warned him .
he hid for three weeks while his father-in-law arranged for an agent to bring him to heathrow for onward flight to usa .
a stranger took him to croydon the next day where he claimed asylum .
his brother has been murdered and his father has been disappeared .
a letter to me from his mother confirms that many of his friends have been killed .
subsequently after escaping he learned that his wife was arrested and tortured for three months and she lost their baby .
this caused him enormous distress .
after he was refused asylum he attempted to go to the usa on a false passport and then spent time in wormwood scrubs .
he was then moved to the detention centre in dover where very concerned prison officers contacted the visitor group .
he was released to our house last august .
he is suffering from depression and nightmares .
he has just been refused asylum .
marion walter , canterbury the international community need to stop being a bystander and they should hold the meles 's government accountable for loss of innocent life .
jon , usa please be aware that eprdf set up this election to gain legitimacy as a democratic government and to qualify for mr tony blair 's debt forgiveness plan .
hence , they allowed the opposition to win a minority of seats but never significant enough to bring about any change in the parliament .
the protests are conducted to bring out this fact and the massacre affirms that eprdf at the core is not pro-democracy .
with mr bush stating yesterday that " nobody wants to give money to a country that 's corrupt , where leaders take money and put it in their pocket " these victims have given their lives to show the true colours of the ruling party to the rest of the world .
k arnold , washington dc i am really disturbed by what happen to innocent life and it is really regrettable .
my condolences to the family of those who lost their lives .
i want to say something as it relates to the opposition party leaders , if they are committed to democratization of our country it was this time to come out and condemn the acts of their supporters or even if they are not their supporters because the only win win situation for them was to capitalize in what they gained in the political process and it would demonstrate their political maturity .
i think concerning the election results the board is working on the disputed results so calm and restraint should be advocated .
the only people who support the violence are the enemy of our country .
the government and the opposition party need to gracefully accept what comes through the political process .
once again my fellow citizens do not be victims of such violence ; we have come through a lot and need to learn from past experiences .
god bless all .
tola wakjira , alexandria , usa the protestors were to blame also for violating the protest ban and for provoking the police mestuwat , ethiopia i read about yeneayhu 's comments and i would also like to comment .
i was around the semen hotel area and i saw that the people over there were shouting at the police and trying to provoke them and the police simply stood there and waited patiently until the people started throwing stones and after that the people were even trying to take the arms of the police .
although the loss of lives were a sad thing that happened , the protestors were to blame also for violating the protest ban and for provoking the police .
mestuwat , ethiopia i live and work around merkato .
this morning i went to my work place to see things and to buy private news papers .
after i did all that i started returning home .
while i was returning , around sabatenga , i saw a crowd fighting with the military police , agazi .
everyone was throwing stones on the tigrean soldiers .
it seems that people were fighting with a colonizer .
the agazi , in reply , fired live ammunition directly to the crowd .
i saw two people die .
right now , i ' m getting a phone call from a friend and he is informing me that tanks are roving around lidata and abenet .
what 's next ?
yasteserial , addis ababa , ethiopia no words are found sufficient to explain what has been happening in addis today .
i saw five people shot dead a few meters away from me .
i am still shaking .
i did not expect that i could escape the gun shot and put my eyewitness here .
yeneayhu has explained it a little but much more still remains uncovered .
i know saddam hussein was the leader of iraqi people .
it will be a matter of time - the dictators who use weapons on civilians will collect their fruit .
god does not only watch but acts as well .
akalu estfanose , addis ababa , ethiopia they must jointly tell the public that both parties will peacefully wait for the investigation of the alleged fraud melkamu , addis ababa , ethiopia it is really a horrible scene .
but i think the government alone can do little as long as some opposition parties and some individuals try to take advantage of this crisis .
some have called for public disobedience and encouraged the public in violent activities that could have lead to unnecessary lose of innocent life and destruction of property .
after witnessing a very peaceful and democratic pre-election campaign and election , it is really demoralizing to see what is happening now .
the ruling party and the incoming administration to addis ababa must come forward immediately to calm down the anger of the people and stop further blood shed instead of blaming one another .
they must jointly tell the public that both parties will peacefully wait for the investigation of the alleged fraud in vote counting and also will be abide by the outcome of the investigation .
if both choose to continue the blame game , i am afraid we have not yet seen the worst .
melkamu , addis ababa , ethiopia yeneayhu 's account has not only touched me deeply , i can not comprehend the terror that he must be feeling currently , but it angers me intensely .
how can armed militia -lrb- some might comment a mob -rrb- attack an unarmed crowd of its own people ?
what must the members of that cowardly force be thinking as they brutally attack people running from them ?
it also raises questions as to what the western world will do about this drastic incident .
will the likes of blair and bush simply let this lie like the events that occurred in uzbekistan recently , only to pick up the pieces in months to come claiming a ' victory ' for the forces of democracy ?
i hope many people are deeply worried about the implications of these events , i for one am .

he was arrested and tortured many times from the age of 17 in ethiopia .
finally the police got real evidence of his political activity .
he was away from home when they came to arrest him november 2003 and his wife warned him .
he hid for three weeks while his father-in-law arranged for an agent to bring him to heathrow for onward flight to usa .
a stranger took him to croydon the next day where he claimed asylum .
his brother has been murdered and his father has been disappeared .
a letter to me from his mother confirms that many of his friends have been killed .
subsequently after escaping he learned that his wife was arrested and tortured for three months and she lost their baby .
this caused him enormous distress .
after he was refused asylum he attempted to go to the usa on a false passport and then spent time in wormwood scrubs .
he was then moved to the detention centre in dover where very concerned prison officers contacted the visitor group .
he was released to our house last august .
he is suffering from depression and nightmares .
he has just been refused asylum .
marion walter , canterbury the international community need to stop being a bystander and they should hold the meles 's government accountable for loss of innocent life .
jon , usa please be aware that eprdf set up this election to gain legitimacy as a democratic government and to qualify for mr tony blair 's debt forgiveness plan .
hence , they allowed the opposition to win a minority of seats but never significant enough to bring about any change in the parliament .
the protests are conducted to bring out this fact and the massacre affirms that eprdf at the core is not pro-democracy .
with mr bush stating yesterday that " nobody wants to give money to a country that 's corrupt , where leaders take money and put it in their pocket " these victims have given their lives to show the true colours of the ruling party to the rest of the world .
k arnold , washington dc i am really disturbed by what happen to innocent life and it is really regrettable .
my condolences to the family of those who lost their lives .
i want to say something as it relates to the opposition party leaders , if they are committed to democratization of our country it was this time to come out and condemn the acts of their supporters or even if they are not their supporters because the only win win situation for them was to capitalize in what they gained in the political process and it would demonstrate their political maturity .
i think concerning the election results the board is working on the disputed results so calm and restraint should be advocated .
the only people who support the violence are the enemy of our country .
the government and the opposition party need to gracefully accept what comes through the political process .
once again my fellow citizens do not be victims of such violence ; we have come through a lot and need to learn from past experiences .
god bless all .
tola wakjira , alexandria , usa the protestors were to blame also for violating the protest ban and for provoking the police mestuwat , ethiopia i read about yeneayhu 's comments and i would also like to comment .
i was around the semen hotel area and i saw that the people over there were shouting at the police and trying to provoke them and the police simply stood there and waited patiently until the people started throwing stones and after that the people were even trying to take the arms of the police .
although the loss of lives were a sad thing that happened , the protestors were to blame also for violating the protest ban and for provoking the police .
mestuwat , ethiopia i live and work around merkato .
this morning i went to my work place to see things and to buy private news papers .
after i did all that i started returning home .
while i was returning , around sabatenga , i saw a crowd fighting with the military police , agazi .
everyone was throwing stones on the tigrean soldiers .
it seems that people were fighting with a colonizer .
the agazi , in reply , fired live ammunition directly to the crowd .
i saw two people die .
right now , i ' m getting a phone call from a friend and he is informing me that tanks are roving around lidata and abenet .
what 's next ?
yasteserial , addis ababa , ethiopia no words are found sufficient to explain what has been happening in addis today .
i saw five people shot dead a few meters away from me .
i am still shaking .
i did not expect that i could escape the gun shot and put my eyewitness here .
yeneayhu has explained it a little but much more still remains uncovered .
i know saddam hussein was the leader of iraqi people .
it will be a matter of time - the dictators who use weapons on civilians will collect their fruit .
god does not only watch but acts as well .
akalu estfanose , addis ababa , ethiopia they must jointly tell the public that both parties will peacefully wait for the investigation of the alleged fraud melkamu , addis ababa , ethiopia it is really a horrible scene .
but i think the government alone can do little as long as some opposition parties and some individuals try to take advantage of this crisis .
some have called for public disobedience and encouraged the public in violent activities that could have lead to unnecessary lose of innocent life and destruction of property .
after witnessing a very peaceful and democratic pre-election campaign and election , it is really demoralizing to see what is happening now .
the ruling party and the incoming administration to addis ababa must come forward immediately to calm down the anger of the people and stop further blood shed instead of blaming one another .
they must jointly tell the public that both parties will peacefully wait for the investigation of the alleged fraud in vote counting and also will be abide by the outcome of the investigation .
if both choose to continue the blame game , i am afraid we have not yet seen the worst .
melkamu , addis ababa , ethiopia yeneayhu 's account has not only touched me deeply , i can not comprehend the terror that he must be feeling currently , but it angers me intensely .
how can armed militia -lrb- some might comment a mob -rrb- attack an unarmed crowd of its own people ?
what must the members of that cowardly force be thinking as they brutally attack people running from them ?
it also raises questions as to what the western world will do about this drastic incident .
will the likes of blair and bush simply let this lie like the events that occurred in uzbekistan recently , only to pick up the pieces in months to come claiming a ' victory ' for the forces of democracy ?
i hope many people are deeply worried about the implications of these events , i for one am .

yeneayhu saw some of his students attacked with gun butts i am running here and there to see what has been going on .
i can see people running away from very well armed police in the distance .
you just have to run , just run .
you have to be really alert as you do n't know what will happen .
simple ordinary victims it is the most terrible thing because the military forces do not speak the same language as us .
they speak the tigrigna language as they are from mekle - the ruling party 's area in the north .
as you ca n't communicate with them , simply ordinary people like me are also victims .
if i tried to explain that i had nothing to do with all of this they would n't be able to understand .
no-one around here can tell them anything .
and so that is why all the people run away as soon as they see them coming .
big clash this morning i saw three people that had been shot dead .
they were picked up by a red cross car .
yeneayhu said people were really fighting the police i had been going to the commercial college , which is near the mercato market in the city .
a lot of people were at the market .
there are no taxis today because of the strike and so no-one was at work .
people had thought that the government would make an announcement in response to the disputed election results , following the past two days of protests .
but instead the mekle had a big clash with the people .
there were no cars as all the ways had been closed with rocks .
people were throwing stones and then the police started really shooting .
gun shots people were really fighting them .
anyone who had been on the street was involved .
have your say when the crowd dispersed in fear , they started shooting at them .
there was blood everywhere yosef , addis ababa send us your comments i was running , just like the others .
but i saw the military people .
they were directly shooting at everyone .
they were aiming right at the people .
it was the worst thing about today 's experience in the city .
this is really the most disastrous thing in my whole life .
uncertainty and tomorrow , from what i have heard , the same thing will happen again .
it will keep happening until the government takes action over the election results .
people want some kind of immediate action .
as of yet though , i have not heard any government body reporting about the situation .
nothing .
if you would like to comment on yeneayhu 's experience please use the form below .
your comments : a ruling party with no intention of giving power , an opposition with no means of support , and international community with no care ...
sef beni amer , addis ababa for the record i support neither the ruling party nor the opposition .
if you allow me , let me give you a somewhat objective view of the circumstances that led to this uncertainty .
in the next few months ethiopia could either be a truly democratic country or a truly chaotic country .
it all depends on how the world reacts .
the last few months , ethiopians have experienced a political freedom never seen before .
however , this freedom has evaporated since the election .
the ruling party truly thought that they would win the election fair and square .
they did not even consider the possibility of losing the election .
on election day , people voted against the ruling party .
the ruling party realized that they lost all the seats in the capital city , they started making sure that one way or the other the votes from rural area favour them .
even though the international observers know for a fact that the election is being manipulated , they are afraid to say the truth because the truth will most likely make ethiopia a chaotic country rather than democratic .
the truth will set you free .
millions around the country are saying , enough is enough and more than a few are giving their life .
a ruling party with no intention of giving power , an opposition with no means of support , and international community with no care ... something tells me that the fortune of ethiopia is going south .
never mind the world , even god has forgotten ethiopia .
the people of ethiopia have spoken .
it 's better to listen now rather than to witness another rwanda .
let us witness another georgia .
another ukraine .
and another ethiopia ?
sef beni amer , addis ababa , ethiopia amongst my friends i was one of few who always insisted in giving the benefit of the doubt to the incumbent prime minister assuming that he will eventually democratize the country .
but after seeing meles 's agazi force on the rampage on unarmed civilian today i believe that meles and his people should be held accountable .
tadesse i just want to thank yeneayhu for letting the rest of the world know what is going on in ethiopia .
masha all of your comments reflect that you are tired of meles 's smartness agazi , addis ababa i have already read yeneayhu 's comment .
do n't take it to the wrong way because i am a tigrian -lrb- as my name indicates -rrb- but to be honest his comment is so disappointing .
it is an ethnic based comment .
all of the militaries are not from the tigray region .
they have also completed at least eighth grade so that means that they can speak the national language amharic .
all of your comments reflect that you are tired of meles 's smartness .
let 's not hide the truth .
the opposition party -lrb- cud -rrb- has announced through pamphlets to gather for a mob which was definitely restricted for a while .
the thing i am telling you is that the mob is not a sudden action that occurred on monday .
my reason / evidence is that my friend 's sister was going to take her exam on monday .
but at the cud meeting on saturday a student told her that she did n't have to worry because there would n't be an exam .
this indicates that the mob was deliberately planned .
please avoid your ethnic reflections .
please just tell the truth .
agazi , addis ababa , ethiopia he was then moved to the detention centre in dover where very concerned prison officers contacted the visitor group marion walter , canterbury i know one asylum seeker from ethiopia very well .
he lived in our house for eight months after eventually been released from detention in this country .
