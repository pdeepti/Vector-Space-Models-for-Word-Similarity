the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .
so the only thing one really can say to the competitors is : keep on rockin ' . julia bindert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

police sources told afp that the three men in british custody , yassin hassan omar , muktar said ibrahim and ramsi mohammed , are being held at the country 's highest-security police station , paddington green . machine gun-toting british police were seen by witnesses firing tear gas and apparently setting off stun grenades as they raided two apartments in west london friday , arresting three men in all .

" louise christian , who represented former guantanamo bay detainees , said in the independent newspaper that police will rely on the ' good cop , bad cop ' routine to extract information . psychology expert david canter said police had a big advantage over the would-be suicide bombers .
it is unlikely the failed bombers were trained in how to handle such an interview , university of liverpool professor canter wrote in the times .
" it would rather undermine the commitment to kill yourself if your handlers ran a session on what to do if it failed . " britain 's newspapers hailed the police 's swift captures in the biggest operation they have faced since the second world war .
the times said the arrests would come as a relief to all in britain and were " a tribute to a police force that has passed one of the most severe tests in its history . " " got the bastards " said the front page of the sun , britain 's biggest selling daily .
security forces " combined brilliantly to corner 21/7 bombing suspects like rats in a trap , " the tabloid said .

hussain appeared at an extradition hearing on saturday . judges could take weeks to come to a decision on deporting him to britain . hussain said he and his accomplices wanted their attack to spread fear in london , in an apparent confession reported by italian newspapers saturday .
" we wanted to make an attack , but only as a demonstration , " several newspapers quoted the 27-year-old as saying , without citing a source .
" the investigation … is still continuing .
it is dynamic and wide-ranging .
there will be more very visible police activity , " anti-terrorist police chief peter clarke told reporters late friday .
he also warned the country not to let down its guard .
" we must not be complacent .
the threat remains , and is very real , " he said .
more arrests three other men were arrested during separate raids in west london and leicester , north of the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's pope pope stresses interfaith dialogue german reception of new pope mixed new pope delights and disappoints from a small bavarian town to the papacy europe -pipe- 30.07.2005 benedict 's first 100 days stress continuity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi admits it 's not easy being pope pope benedict xvi has big shoes to fill as successor to the beloved john paul ii .
in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .

turkey attached a declaration to the document , the so-called ankara protocol , stating that its signature did not amount to recognizing the island nation . " the signing , ratification and implementation of this protocol in no way means recognition of the republic of cyprus , which the protocol refers to , " a statement from the foreign ministry in ankara said . the declaration read : " turkey will continue to regard the greek cypriot authorities as exercising authority , control and jurisdiction only in the territory south of the buffer zone -lrb- in cyprus -rrb- ... and as not representing the turkish cypriot people and will treat the acts performed by them accordingly . "
days of uncertainty the signing in brussels came after days of uncertainty over what kind of declaration turkey might attach to the protocol - and whether the eu would decide that it went against the spirit of the agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , welcomed the move , noted that turkey had reaffirmed its long-standing stance on cyprus , and did not rule out that eu members could decide to issue a counter-declaration .
" the council of the european union will examine the terms of the turkish declaration in due course with a view to agreeing any further eu response , " the presidency said in a separate statement . turkey is the only country to recognize the turkish republic of northern cyprus , which was proclaimed after turkish troops seized the island 's northern third in 1974 in response to a coup aimed at uniting cyprus with greece .
a step towards recognition ? a european commission spokesman said earlier on friday that by signing the protocol , turkey would recognize that the eu has 25 members , even if it does not legally recognize the greek cypriot government .
" it is very important to underline that this protocol represents the recognition of the fact that the eu has 25 member states , " said the spokesman , amadeu altafaj tardio . eu officials have warned that ankara 's persistent refusal to endorse a member of the bloc would create difficulties for its turkey has received no guarantee it will become a member at the end of that process . a eurobarometer opinion poll released earlier this month indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to ankara , with only 35 percent in favor .
opposition to turkey 's entry was also cited as a key factor in french and dutch voters rejecting the eu 's constitution in polls which plunged the bloc into an unprecedented crisis last month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to take important step in eu bid turkey will sign a protocol wednesday extending its current eu ties to the bloc 's 10 most recent member states in a move which will see ankara meet the final condition for opening membership talks on october 3 .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .

he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .
silencing dissenters and , in critics ' minds , quashing independent thought that in any way diverged from the vatican 's conservative theological view . it is not expected that he will part from his views and he has shown himself to be up for a fight when it comes to what he calls the " dictatorship of relativism . "
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

"
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

the bank had in the past made clear it intended to sell a portion of its previous 10.4 percent stake in daimlerchrysler .
the faz suggested ackermann could have pressure kopper to take steps in the bank 's favor .
deutsche bank sold some of those shares the day schrempp announced his resignation , news that caused daimlerchrysler stocks to shoot up in value . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen on saturday called on daimlerchrysler to provide transparency by explaining the events that led to schrempp 's resignation .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .
so the only thing one really can say to the competitors is : keep on rockin ' . julia bindert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .
so the only thing one really can say to the competitors is : keep on rockin ' . julia bindert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

turkey attached a declaration to the document , the so-called ankara protocol , stating that its signature did not amount to recognizing the island nation . " the signing , ratification and implementation of this protocol in no way means recognition of the republic of cyprus , which the protocol refers to , " a statement from the foreign ministry in ankara said . the declaration read : " turkey will continue to regard the greek cypriot authorities as exercising authority , control and jurisdiction only in the territory south of the buffer zone -lrb- in cyprus -rrb- ... and as not representing the turkish cypriot people and will treat the acts performed by them accordingly . "
days of uncertainty the signing in brussels came after days of uncertainty over what kind of declaration turkey might attach to the protocol - and whether the eu would decide that it went against the spirit of the agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , welcomed the move , noted that turkey had reaffirmed its long-standing stance on cyprus , and did not rule out that eu members could decide to issue a counter-declaration .
" the council of the european union will examine the terms of the turkish declaration in due course with a view to agreeing any further eu response , " the presidency said in a separate statement . turkey is the only country to recognize the turkish republic of northern cyprus , which was proclaimed after turkish troops seized the island 's northern third in 1974 in response to a coup aimed at uniting cyprus with greece .
a step towards recognition ? a european commission spokesman said earlier on friday that by signing the protocol , turkey would recognize that the eu has 25 members , even if it does not legally recognize the greek cypriot government .
" it is very important to underline that this protocol represents the recognition of the fact that the eu has 25 member states , " said the spokesman , amadeu altafaj tardio . eu officials have warned that ankara 's persistent refusal to endorse a member of the bloc would create difficulties for its turkey has received no guarantee it will become a member at the end of that process . a eurobarometer opinion poll released earlier this month indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to ankara , with only 35 percent in favor .
opposition to turkey 's entry was also cited as a key factor in french and dutch voters rejecting the eu 's constitution in polls which plunged the bloc into an unprecedented crisis last month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to take important step in eu bid turkey will sign a protocol wednesday extending its current eu ties to the bloc 's 10 most recent member states in a move which will see ankara meet the final condition for opening membership talks on october 3 .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .
silencing dissenters and , in critics ' minds , quashing independent thought that in any way diverged from the vatican 's conservative theological view . it is not expected that he will part from his views and he has shown himself to be up for a fight when it comes to what he calls the " dictatorship of relativism . "
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .

turkey attached a declaration to the document , the so-called ankara protocol , stating that its signature did not amount to recognizing the island nation . " the signing , ratification and implementation of this protocol in no way means recognition of the republic of cyprus , which the protocol refers to , " a statement from the foreign ministry in ankara said . the declaration read : " turkey will continue to regard the greek cypriot authorities as exercising authority , control and jurisdiction only in the territory south of the buffer zone -lrb- in cyprus -rrb- ... and as not representing the turkish cypriot people and will treat the acts performed by them accordingly .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .
so the only thing one really can say to the competitors is : keep on rockin ' . julia bindert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's pope pope stresses interfaith dialogue german reception of new pope mixed new pope delights and disappoints from a small bavarian town to the papacy europe -pipe- 30.07.2005 benedict 's first 100 days stress continuity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi admits it 's not easy being pope pope benedict xvi has big shoes to fill as successor to the beloved john paul ii .
in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .
silencing dissenters and , in critics ' minds , quashing independent thought that in any way diverged from the vatican 's conservative theological view . it is not expected that he will part from his views and he has shown himself to be up for a fight when it comes to what he calls the " dictatorship of relativism . "
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

" i had already talked about it with supervisory board head hilmar kopper for some time , " schrempp told german newsmagazine focus .
he said the two men concurred that the end of the year was the best time for a change of leadership . according to der spiegel newsmagazine , kopper and workers ' council head erich klemm had already decided in april 2004 that schrempp should only lead the company for another two or three years , which the latter agreed to .
still , the ceo 's contract was renewed until 2008 in order to avoid a debate over his successor .
in return , schrempp agreed not to claim the remaining salary he would have normally been due for resigning before his contract 's expiration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper kopper -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel that he could tell that schrempp no longer wanted to continue after he faced harsh criticism over his wife 's position at daimlerchrysler attacked at the company 's annual shareholders ' meeting in april .
further talks between schrempp , kopper and klemm about the ceo 's future started in may , kopper said .
schrempp forced out ? the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that institutional investors had forced schrempp 's resignation .
hedge funds had been buying up daimlerchrysler shares since the april shareholders ' meeting in order to have more influence , the paper wrote . speculation also raged about deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann having played a role in the events .
the bank had in the past made clear it intended to sell a portion of its previous 10.4 percent stake in daimlerchrysler .
the faz suggested ackermann could have pressure kopper to take steps in the bank 's favor .
deutsche bank sold some of those shares the day schrempp announced his resignation , news that caused daimlerchrysler stocks to shoot up in value . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen on saturday called on daimlerchrysler to provide transparency by explaining the events that led to schrempp 's resignation .

still , police warned brits to remain vigilant . dramatic raids in london and rome left the alleged bombers in police custody as detectives were congratulated for rounding up the men on the run .
police sources told afp that the three men in british custody , yassin hassan omar , muktar said ibrahim and ramsi mohammed , are being held at the country 's highest-security police station , paddington green . machine gun-toting british police were seen by witnesses firing tear gas and apparently setting off stun grenades as they raided two apartments in west london friday , arresting three men in all .
among these were at least one , and probably two of the four suspected bombers who went on the run when their explosives failed to detonate fully on three london subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police sniper lines up his weapon as he takes up position in the notting hill district of london friday police feared that while the bombers remained at large , they might have tried once more to repeat the july 7 carnage , when 56 people , including four british muslim suicide bombers , were killed in a similar string of attacks .

" louise christian , who represented former guantanamo bay detainees , said in the independent newspaper that police will rely on the ' good cop , bad cop ' routine to extract information . psychology expert david canter said police had a big advantage over the would-be suicide bombers .
it is unlikely the failed bombers were trained in how to handle such an interview , university of liverpool professor canter wrote in the times .
" it would rather undermine the commitment to kill yourself if your handlers ran a session on what to do if it failed . " britain 's newspapers hailed the police 's swift captures in the biggest operation they have faced since the second world war .
the times said the arrests would come as a relief to all in britain and were " a tribute to a police force that has passed one of the most severe tests in its history . " " got the bastards " said the front page of the sun , britain 's biggest selling daily .
security forces " combined brilliantly to corner 21/7 bombing suspects like rats in a trap , " the tabloid said . " what a magnificent day for british justice , " said the daily express in its editorial . the guardian compared the london bombers to the irish republican army , which thursday committed itself to peaceful means .

hussain appeared at an extradition hearing on saturday . judges could take weeks to come to a decision on deporting him to britain . hussain said he and his accomplices wanted their attack to spread fear in london , in an apparent confession reported by italian newspapers saturday .
" we wanted to make an attack , but only as a demonstration , " several newspapers quoted the 27-year-old as saying , without citing a source .
" the investigation … is still continuing .
it is dynamic and wide-ranging .
there will be more very visible police activity , " anti-terrorist police chief peter clarke told reporters late friday .
he also warned the country not to let down its guard .
" we must not be complacent .
the threat remains , and is very real , " he said .
more arrests three other men were arrested during separate raids in west london and leicester , north of the capital .
police said two women were still in custody saturday morning after being arrested friday at london 's liverpool street mainline railway terminus , on the eastern edge of the city center .
a witness told afp he saw two women wearing islamic scarves pinned down by officers after they ran away when stopped for a routine check . detectives were continuing to search a building in the old kent road area of south london early saturday in connection with the july 21 attacks .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .
silencing dissenters and , in critics ' minds , quashing independent thought that in any way diverged from the vatican 's conservative theological view . it is not expected that he will part from his views and he has shown himself to be up for a fight when it comes to what he calls the " dictatorship of relativism . "
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

still , police warned brits to remain vigilant . dramatic raids in london and rome left the alleged bombers in police custody as detectives were congratulated for rounding up the men on the run .
police sources told afp that the three men in british custody , yassin hassan omar , muktar said ibrahim and ramsi mohammed , are being held at the country 's highest-security police station , paddington green . machine gun-toting british police were seen by witnesses firing tear gas and apparently setting off stun grenades as they raided two apartments in west london friday , arresting three men in all .
among these were at least one , and probably two of the four suspected bombers who went on the run when their explosives failed to detonate fully on three london subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police sniper lines up his weapon as he takes up position in the notting hill district of london friday police feared that while the bombers remained at large , they might have tried once more to repeat the july 7 carnage , when 56 people , including four british muslim suicide bombers , were killed in a similar string of attacks .
questioning begins experts speculated on the methods police will use to try to uncover the shadowy network behind the suspected bombers .
the terror suspects can look forward to a fortnight under the microscope in the paddington green basement . " you 're completely cut off .
mentally it 's really tough .
it could break anyone , " 42-year-old john , an ex-soldier and one-time paddington green detainee , told the daily mirror newspaper .
" when you arrive , you 're locked in a 15 foot by 10 foot -lrb- three meter by 3.6 meter -rrb- cage like an animal . " louise christian , who represented former guantanamo bay detainees , said in the independent newspaper that police will rely on the ' good cop , bad cop ' routine to extract information . psychology expert david canter said police had a big advantage over the would-be suicide bombers .
it is unlikely the failed bombers were trained in how to handle such an interview , university of liverpool professor canter wrote in the times .
" it would rather undermine the commitment to kill yourself if your handlers ran a session on what to do if it failed . " britain 's newspapers hailed the police 's swift captures in the biggest operation they have faced since the second world war .
the times said the arrests would come as a relief to all in britain and were " a tribute to a police force that has passed one of the most severe tests in its history . " " got the bastards " said the front page of the sun , britain 's biggest selling daily .
security forces " combined brilliantly to corner 21/7 bombing suspects like rats in a trap , " the tabloid said . " what a magnificent day for british justice , " said the daily express in its editorial . the guardian compared the london bombers to the irish republican army , which thursday committed itself to peaceful means .
italian press reports confession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police officers cordon off the scene of a police raid in an apartment block in west london , friday muktar said ibrahim and ramsi mohammed were both arrested friday , while somali-born yasin hassan omar , had already been detained on wednesday in birmingham , central england . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu announced that somali-born briton , osman hussain , whom he called " the fourth attacker in london on july 21 , " had been arrested in rome .
hussain appeared at an extradition hearing on saturday . judges could take weeks to come to a decision on deporting him to britain . hussain said he and his accomplices wanted their attack to spread fear in london , in an apparent confession reported by italian newspapers saturday .
" we wanted to make an attack , but only as a demonstration , " several newspapers quoted the 27-year-old as saying , without citing a source .
" the investigation … is still continuing .
it is dynamic and wide-ranging .
there will be more very visible police activity , " anti-terrorist police chief peter clarke told reporters late friday .
he also warned the country not to let down its guard .
" we must not be complacent .
the threat remains , and is very real , " he said .
more arrests three other men were arrested during separate raids in west london and leicester , north of the capital .
police said two women were still in custody saturday morning after being arrested friday at london 's liverpool street mainline railway terminus , on the eastern edge of the city center .
a witness told afp he saw two women wearing islamic scarves pinned down by officers after they ran away when stopped for a routine check . detectives were continuing to search a building in the old kent road area of south london early saturday in connection with the july 21 attacks .

during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .
silencing dissenters and , in critics ' minds , quashing independent thought that in any way diverged from the vatican 's conservative theological view . it is not expected that he will part from his views and he has shown himself to be up for a fight when it comes to what he calls the " dictatorship of relativism . "
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's pope pope stresses interfaith dialogue german reception of new pope mixed new pope delights and disappoints from a small bavarian town to the papacy europe -pipe- 30.07.2005 benedict 's first 100 days stress continuity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi admits it 's not easy being pope pope benedict xvi has big shoes to fill as successor to the beloved john paul ii .
in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's pope pope stresses interfaith dialogue german reception of new pope mixed new pope delights and disappoints from a small bavarian town to the papacy europe -pipe- 30.07.2005 benedict 's first 100 days stress continuity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi admits it 's not easy being pope pope benedict xvi has big shoes to fill as successor to the beloved john paul ii .
in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .
silencing dissenters and , in critics ' minds , quashing independent thought that in any way diverged from the vatican 's conservative theological view . it is not expected that he will part from his views and he has shown himself to be up for a fight when it comes to what he calls the " dictatorship of relativism . "
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .
so the only thing one really can say to the competitors is : keep on rockin ' . julia bindert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .

turkey attached a declaration to the document , the so-called ankara protocol , stating that its signature did not amount to recognizing the island nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.07.2005 police grill suspected london bombers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four suspects are all in police custody the four arrested fugitives from the botched july 21 london bomb attacks faced intense questioning as police were feted saturday for seizing them .
still , police warned brits to remain vigilant . dramatic raids in london and rome left the alleged bombers in police custody as detectives were congratulated for rounding up the men on the run .
police sources told afp that the three men in british custody , yassin hassan omar , muktar said ibrahim and ramsi mohammed , are being held at the country 's highest-security police station , paddington green . machine gun-toting british police were seen by witnesses firing tear gas and apparently setting off stun grenades as they raided two apartments in west london friday , arresting three men in all .
among these were at least one , and probably two of the four suspected bombers who went on the run when their explosives failed to detonate fully on three london subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police sniper lines up his weapon as he takes up position in the notting hill district of london friday police feared that while the bombers remained at large , they might have tried once more to repeat the july 7 carnage , when 56 people , including four british muslim suicide bombers , were killed in a similar string of attacks .
questioning begins experts speculated on the methods police will use to try to uncover the shadowy network behind the suspected bombers .
the terror suspects can look forward to a fortnight under the microscope in the paddington green basement . " you 're completely cut off .
mentally it 's really tough .
it could break anyone , " 42-year-old john , an ex-soldier and one-time paddington green detainee , told the daily mirror newspaper .
" when you arrive , you 're locked in a 15 foot by 10 foot -lrb- three meter by 3.6 meter -rrb- cage like an animal . " louise christian , who represented former guantanamo bay detainees , said in the independent newspaper that police will rely on the ' good cop , bad cop ' routine to extract information . psychology expert david canter said police had a big advantage over the would-be suicide bombers .
it is unlikely the failed bombers were trained in how to handle such an interview , university of liverpool professor canter wrote in the times .
" it would rather undermine the commitment to kill yourself if your handlers ran a session on what to do if it failed . " britain 's newspapers hailed the police 's swift captures in the biggest operation they have faced since the second world war .
the times said the arrests would come as a relief to all in britain and were " a tribute to a police force that has passed one of the most severe tests in its history . " " got the bastards " said the front page of the sun , britain 's biggest selling daily .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .

"
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .
so the only thing one really can say to the competitors is : keep on rockin ' . julia bindert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the neue deutsche welle rises german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .

turkey attached a declaration to the document , the so-called ankara protocol , stating that its signature did not amount to recognizing the island nation . " the signing , ratification and implementation of this protocol in no way means recognition of the republic of cyprus , which the protocol refers to , " a statement from the foreign ministry in ankara said . the declaration read : " turkey will continue to regard the greek cypriot authorities as exercising authority , control and jurisdiction only in the territory south of the buffer zone -lrb- in cyprus -rrb- ... and as not representing the turkish cypriot people and will treat the acts performed by them accordingly . "
days of uncertainty the signing in brussels came after days of uncertainty over what kind of declaration turkey might attach to the protocol - and whether the eu would decide that it went against the spirit of the agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , welcomed the move , noted that turkey had reaffirmed its long-standing stance on cyprus , and did not rule out that eu members could decide to issue a counter-declaration .
" the council of the european union will examine the terms of the turkish declaration in due course with a view to agreeing any further eu response , " the presidency said in a separate statement . turkey is the only country to recognize the turkish republic of northern cyprus , which was proclaimed after turkish troops seized the island 's northern third in 1974 in response to a coup aimed at uniting cyprus with greece .
a step towards recognition ? a european commission spokesman said earlier on friday that by signing the protocol , turkey would recognize that the eu has 25 members , even if it does not legally recognize the greek cypriot government .
" it is very important to underline that this protocol represents the recognition of the fact that the eu has 25 member states , " said the spokesman , amadeu altafaj tardio . eu officials have warned that ankara 's persistent refusal to endorse a member of the bloc would create difficulties for its turkey has received no guarantee it will become a member at the end of that process . a eurobarometer opinion poll released earlier this month indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to ankara , with only 35 percent in favor .
opposition to turkey 's entry was also cited as a key factor in french and dutch voters rejecting the eu 's constitution in polls which plunged the bloc into an unprecedented crisis last month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey to take important step in eu bid turkey will sign a protocol wednesday extending its current eu ties to the bloc 's 10 most recent member states in a move which will see ankara meet the final condition for opening membership talks on october 3 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's pope pope stresses interfaith dialogue german reception of new pope mixed new pope delights and disappoints from a small bavarian town to the papacy europe -pipe- 30.07.2005 benedict 's first 100 days stress continuity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict xvi admits it 's not easy being pope pope benedict xvi has big shoes to fill as successor to the beloved john paul ii .
in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .
silencing dissenters and , in critics ' minds , quashing independent thought that in any way diverged from the vatican 's conservative theological view . it is not expected that he will part from his views and he has shown himself to be up for a fight when it comes to what he calls the " dictatorship of relativism . "
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .

jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .

because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .

" i had already talked about it with supervisory board head hilmar kopper for some time , " schrempp told german newsmagazine focus .
he said the two men concurred that the end of the year was the best time for a change of leadership . according to der spiegel newsmagazine , kopper and workers ' council head erich klemm had already decided in april 2004 that schrempp should only lead the company for another two or three years , which the latter agreed to .
still , the ceo 's contract was renewed until 2008 in order to avoid a debate over his successor .
in return , schrempp agreed not to claim the remaining salary he would have normally been due for resigning before his contract 's expiration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hilmar kopper kopper -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel that he could tell that schrempp no longer wanted to continue after he faced harsh criticism over his wife 's position at daimlerchrysler attacked at the company 's annual shareholders ' meeting in april .
further talks between schrempp , kopper and klemm about the ceo 's future started in may , kopper said .
schrempp forced out ? the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that institutional investors had forced schrempp 's resignation .
hedge funds had been buying up daimlerchrysler shares since the april shareholders ' meeting in order to have more influence , the paper wrote . speculation also raged about deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann having played a role in the events .
the bank had in the past made clear it intended to sell a portion of its previous 10.4 percent stake in daimlerchrysler .
the faz suggested ackermann could have pressure kopper to take steps in the bank 's favor .
deutsche bank sold some of those shares the day schrempp announced his resignation , news that caused daimlerchrysler stocks to shoot up in value . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen on saturday called on daimlerchrysler to provide transparency by explaining the events that led to schrempp 's resignation .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .
that halcyon state will only be achieved , it is said , when all people play air guitar together .
the reasoning : those playing air guitar have no more time for war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : air guitar aerobics are the news fitness trend in germany others say their fascination with the form comes from its mix of irony and self-portrayal .
the prejudice that air guitar performance is nothing more than a pathetic and somewhat cheesy desire for attention could n't be further from the truth , say the air guitarists themselves . whether history will judge air guitar as true art or only hot air , is still up in the , er , air .
but the competitions are at least a lark to watch and good for a laugh , maybe even a bit of amazement .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .

" indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .

"
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .

but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .

he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .

the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .
" but they 're very proud of me and like seeing me in newspaper articles or hearing me in radio interviews . " the fan base is growing air guitar is being taken - somewhat - seriously in countries around the world and has many fans .
in fact , the championships in finland are celebrating their 10th anniversary this year .
besides germany , flourishing air guitar traditions have developed in the us , new zealand and australia .
and the fan base continues to grow .
this year , representatives are travelling to oulu from the united arab emirates , canada and spain for the first time . a town in out-of-the-way finland might seem like a strange place to hold the competition , but it was here that serious air guitar playing was born .
it started on the edges of the oulu video festival and took on a life of its own . swords to air chords the expressed goal of air guitar players around the world as well as the different associations related to the event is world peace .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .

he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.07.2005 rockin ' on air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german champion katharina tomaschek rocks out air guitar - is it a cheesy farce or artistic pastime promoting world peace ?
the jury of public opinion is out on that one , but another jury will crown a world champion .
we hear the lowdown from a german champion . katarina tomaschek , aka leni krawitzkowsky , is the reigning german champion in air guitar .
she is the first woman to represent germany and she 'll show off her talents at the world championships to be held august 25-27 in oulu , finland .
air guitar might sound absurd to many , but it 's a pastime that 's gaining more and more adherents . rules and regulations those who think air guitar is a hobby for cheapskates and dismiss its practitioners as somehow off in the head are mistaken , say fans .
air guitar competitions are held under - believe it or not - a set of very strict rules .
the highest priority is the material comprising the guitar itself , namely air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : logo of the german air guitar foundation however , as long as the performers keep to this basic rule , they have all the artistic freedom they can muster to convince the jury it 's an acoustic or electric guitar they 're playing with .
the same goes for the technique .
whether or not they employ air picks is completely up to them . there is no specific dress code for the competitors , although most agree that pure air is probably not the best choice for a performer 's clothing .
the presence of air roadies , who lug the guitars and cables around , are also up to the discretion of the artist . the judging runs along the same lines as it does in ice skating .
jumps are essential , splits are n't frowned upon .
another element that separates the men from the boys : the " airness " of a player .
according to the definition of the term , " airness " is the ability to " transcend pure imitation and transform the playing into its own art form . "
pretty heady stuff . " leni krawitzkowsky " katharina tomaschek plays air guitar for the pure joy of it .
she thinks her particular talent for the form is in her genes .
that 's a conviction shared by many of her colleagues in the field .
" i come from a very musical family and my father has a great talent for music , " she said . she even plays a " real " instrument along with her airy one , the piano .
her introduction to the air guitar was purely accidental .
she spent a school semester in oulu , finland and happened to attend the air guitar championships there .
she was hooked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina tomaschek from the german city of eberswalde plays air guitar as leni krawitzkowski as she performs to the lenny krawitz song " fields of joy " during the final of the german air guitar championships in berlin on late saturday , july 23 , 2005 .
tomaschek won as the only competing female starter .
her stage name , leni krawitzkowsky , came easily to her .
it is a combination of the names of musician lenny kravitz and mike wazowski , the loveable monster from the film " monsters , inc . " the choice of her repertoire was somewhat more difficult .
she says one has to have a special relation to the piece which will come over during the performance .
because of that , she chose works from lenny kravitz , since she says they show a feminine side of him that appealed to her . while those in the air guitar world find her position as german champion one of honor and deserving of respect , others think differently .
musicians with real guitars might laugh at her dismissively , but at least her family stands behind her - now anyway . " at first they just laughed , since they could n't imagine that air guitar was such a big thing , " she said .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .
silencing dissenters and , in critics ' minds , quashing independent thought that in any way diverged from the vatican 's conservative theological view . it is not expected that he will part from his views and he has shown himself to be up for a fight when it comes to what he calls the " dictatorship of relativism . "
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

" it would rather undermine the commitment to kill yourself if your handlers ran a session on what to do if it failed . " britain 's newspapers hailed the police 's swift captures in the biggest operation they have faced since the second world war .

turkey attached a declaration to the document , the so-called ankara protocol , stating that its signature did not amount to recognizing the island nation . " the signing , ratification and implementation of this protocol in no way means recognition of the republic of cyprus , which the protocol refers to , " a statement from the foreign ministry in ankara said . the declaration read : " turkey will continue to regard the greek cypriot authorities as exercising authority , control and jurisdiction only in the territory south of the buffer zone -lrb- in cyprus -rrb- ... and as not representing the turkish cypriot people and will treat the acts performed by them accordingly .

" it is very important to underline that this protocol represents the recognition of the fact that the eu has 25 member states , " said the spokesman , amadeu altafaj tardio . eu officials have warned that ankara 's persistent refusal to endorse a member of the bloc would create difficulties for its turkey has received no guarantee it will become a member at the end of that process . a eurobarometer opinion poll released earlier this month indicated that 52 percent of europeans are against offering eu membership to ankara , with only 35 percent in favor .

" i had already talked about it with supervisory board head hilmar kopper for some time , " schrempp told german newsmagazine focus .
he said the two men concurred that the end of the year was the best time for a change of leadership . according to der spiegel newsmagazine , kopper and workers ' council head erich klemm had already decided in april 2004 that schrempp should only lead the company for another two or three years , which the latter agreed to .
still , the ceo 's contract was renewed until 2008 in order to avoid a debate over his successor .

the bank had in the past made clear it intended to sell a portion of its previous 10.4 percent stake in daimlerchrysler .
the faz suggested ackermann could have pressure kopper to take steps in the bank 's favor .
deutsche bank sold some of those shares the day schrempp announced his resignation , news that caused daimlerchrysler stocks to shoot up in value . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen on saturday called on daimlerchrysler to provide transparency by explaining the events that led to schrempp 's resignation .

still , police warned brits to remain vigilant . dramatic raids in london and rome left the alleged bombers in police custody as detectives were congratulated for rounding up the men on the run .
police sources told afp that the three men in british custody , yassin hassan omar , muktar said ibrahim and ramsi mohammed , are being held at the country 's highest-security police station , paddington green . machine gun-toting british police were seen by witnesses firing tear gas and apparently setting off stun grenades as they raided two apartments in west london friday , arresting three men in all .
among these were at least one , and probably two of the four suspected bombers who went on the run when their explosives failed to detonate fully on three london subway trains and a double-decker bus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a police sniper lines up his weapon as he takes up position in the notting hill district of london friday police feared that while the bombers remained at large , they might have tried once more to repeat the july 7 carnage , when 56 people , including four british muslim suicide bombers , were killed in a similar string of attacks .
questioning begins experts speculated on the methods police will use to try to uncover the shadowy network behind the suspected bombers .
the terror suspects can look forward to a fortnight under the microscope in the paddington green basement . " you 're completely cut off .
mentally it 's really tough .
it could break anyone , " 42-year-old john , an ex-soldier and one-time paddington green detainee , told the daily mirror newspaper .
" when you arrive , you 're locked in a 15 foot by 10 foot -lrb- three meter by 3.6 meter -rrb- cage like an animal . " louise christian , who represented former guantanamo bay detainees , said in the independent newspaper that police will rely on the ' good cop , bad cop ' routine to extract information . psychology expert david canter said police had a big advantage over the would-be suicide bombers .
it is unlikely the failed bombers were trained in how to handle such an interview , university of liverpool professor canter wrote in the times .
" it would rather undermine the commitment to kill yourself if your handlers ran a session on what to do if it failed . " britain 's newspapers hailed the police 's swift captures in the biggest operation they have faced since the second world war .
the times said the arrests would come as a relief to all in britain and were " a tribute to a police force that has passed one of the most severe tests in its history . " " got the bastards " said the front page of the sun , britain 's biggest selling daily .
security forces " combined brilliantly to corner 21/7 bombing suspects like rats in a trap , " the tabloid said . " what a magnificent day for british justice , " said the daily express in its editorial . the guardian compared the london bombers to the irish republican army , which thursday committed itself to peaceful means .

hussain appeared at an extradition hearing on saturday . judges could take weeks to come to a decision on deporting him to britain . hussain said he and his accomplices wanted their attack to spread fear in london , in an apparent confession reported by italian newspapers saturday .
" we wanted to make an attack , but only as a demonstration , " several newspapers quoted the 27-year-old as saying , without citing a source .
" the investigation … is still continuing .
it is dynamic and wide-ranging .
there will be more very visible police activity , " anti-terrorist police chief peter clarke told reporters late friday .
he also warned the country not to let down its guard .
" we must not be complacent .
the threat remains , and is very real , " he said .
more arrests three other men were arrested during separate raids in west london and leicester , north of the capital .
police said two women were still in custody saturday morning after being arrested friday at london 's liverpool street mainline railway terminus , on the eastern edge of the city center .
a witness told afp he saw two women wearing islamic scarves pinned down by officers after they ran away when stopped for a routine check . detectives were continuing to search a building in the old kent road area of south london early saturday in connection with the july 21 attacks .

in his first 100 days in office , he 's largely walking the same theological path as his predecessor , although his style is his own . ever since the doors in st. peter 's basilica in rome opened on april 19th , and the announcement " habemus papam , " or " we have a pope , " was made , the world has been closely watching to see how benedict xvi would put his own stamp on the papacy as the 265th leader of the catholic church . in just over three months as pope , benedict has shown himself to be faithful to the positions of john paul , espousing many of the same conservative theological viewpoints of his predecessor .
analysts say that is not surprising , since benedict was a close confidante of john paul , helping to draft many of the documents signed by his one-time boss . just weeks after he was elected by the college of cardinals , he indicated during a ceremony that he would stick to john paul 's unwavering stands against abortion and euthanasia .
he has said that abstinence is the only " fail safe " way to prevent aids and that divorced people who remarry without getting an annulment can not receive communion .
he has confirmed his aversion to condoms , abortion and homosexuality . man of the people in other ways , the german-born pope has shown a desire to continue following the almost populist path of john paul .
a man generally more comfortable with books than large groups of people , benedict has signed autographs , delved into crowds to shake hands and even posed for photos with stunned tourists atop mount blanc during an unscheduled stop during his vacation in the italian alps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi is seen near les combes in the aosta valley region , italy he even chose to stay in the same chalet the john paul preferred , although while his predecessor liked to take long hikes , benedict prefers to spend much of his time indoors , studying and playing his beloved piano .
it is also unclear if he will have the same charisma john paul did when relating to youth people .
that will be put to the test at the upcoming catholic world youth day in germany in august , which he will attend . papal watchers also believe he is working on new appointments at his alpine retreat as well as finalizing his first encyclical , which will be a sort of " political manifesto " guiding his papacy . when asked whether the last 100 days had been difficult , benedict replied : " in a certain sense , yes .
i had never thought about -lrb- assuming -rrb- this ministry .
but people have been so good to me and have been supporting me . " indeed , he has joked that he felt like a " guillotine was falling " on him when he realized votes were going his way in the conclave held after john paul 's death . reaching out one apparent early hallmark of his papacy is his stated desire to heal the division between the roman catholic and orthodox churches .
during his first homily as pope and his first papal trip , he pledged that closing the 1,000-year-old rift would be one of his " primary " commitments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. heads the sunday service at the st. george cathedral in the ecumenical patriarchate in istanbul , turkey the gesture appears to have been well received .
orthodox leaders confirmed in june that the theological dialog between the two churches , which was interrupted four years ago , can resume .
he has also been invited to visit istanbul , although the vatican has not made a decision on the trip yet .
the pontiff has also refused to condemn islam in the wake of the terrorist attacks in london .
he told reporters it is important to seek dialog with the best elements of islam , saying that terrorism is not the result of a clash between islam and the west but the action of " fanatics . "
relations with china have also improved since his installation .
a new auxiliary bishop for shanghai was consecrated last month with tacit approval from the vatican .
catholic churches in china are run by a government-approved group and appoint their own bishops .
that a bishop was consecrated there with the vatican 's stamp of approval is seen as something of a breakthrough . misstep benedict has also stumbled in his first 100 days .
he recently offended israel be leaving the country off a list of countries recently hit by terrorism , although it 's not likely to permanently tarnish his reputation with jews , with whom he has had good relations . his spokesman , joaquin navarro-valls , asked that benedict not be judged on the traditional 100-day mark , since popes are not elected for four or five-year terms like most politicians are . " we still have a lot of work to do , " he told reporters . one-time enforcer in his 23 years as prefect of the church 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith - once known as the holy inquisition - benedict , then cardinal joseph ratzinger , earned a reputation as a strict enforcer of church orthodoxy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict when he was known as cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith he regularly crossed swords with many more liberal-minded bishops and priests , including liberation theology proponents in latin america , and always came out on top .
silencing dissenters and , in critics ' minds , quashing independent thought that in any way diverged from the vatican 's conservative theological view . it is not expected that he will part from his views and he has shown himself to be up for a fight when it comes to what he calls the " dictatorship of relativism . "
he wants to reign in encroaching secularism in the west , and has not shied away from voicing scathing critiques of its ebbing faith , which he blames on a change in social attitudes in the 1960s . he described the western world this week as one which is " tired of its own culture " and where " there 's no longer evidence for a need of god , even less of christ .

his ministry is spread across three churches , despite a six-year high last year in the number of men and women who decided to join the church of england clergy .
for the reverend martin lee life is busy .
he oversees three somerset parishes - brent knoll , east brent and lympsham .
in many ways they are thriving - they are wealthy villages , with a combined population of 3,500 .
his congregations range in size from about 55 to 75 .
but he is responsible for three parishes , when 20 years ago it would have been just one .
costly spire and like other rural communities , many young people are being forced to leave , priced out of the property market .
as a result villagers tend to be retired or " established " , or wealthy londoners buying second homes .
the three villages , all a stone 's throw from the m5 , also attract commuters who work in nearby bristol or taunton . "
part of the beauty of the church of england is that it endeavours to be accessible to people " father martin lee ln pictures : a vicar 's day more often than not , they work long hours and so do not always have the time to take part in church life , says father lee .
even so , he has plenty to do .
he sits on the board of governors for three schools and on the diocesan board of education .
on top of that , there are morning prayers , evening prayers , three sunday services , funerals , weddings , baptisms , church fetes , and day-to-day pastoral care .
there is also the small matter of raising the £ 36,000 a year " diocesan share " due to the diocese of bath and wells , the larger church regional area of which his parishes are a part .
only recently a massive fundraising mission in the community raised £ 200,000 to save east brent 's church - st mary in the virgin - after the dangerous state of its unusual 14th century spire left its future in doubt .
" the parish council spent a long time deciding whether to try and raise the funds or put the church in the hands of the redundant church society , " he said .
vicar shortage in the end they decided to try to save the church and the " tremendous " support from people showed they had made the right decision .
the 18-month appeal revealed how the area valued the church , even if residents did not necessarily attend sunday service and donate to the weekly collection plate .
" they were hugely generous to us , " said father lee .
" the village gave over £ 60,000 and the rest came in grants .
that 's an awful lot . "
but , he says , in many ways the biggest threat to the church of england is a shortage of priests .
stuart boyd , 54 - father lee 's newly ordained curate , or assistant - agrees .
" one of the interesting things for me , for example on sunday -lsb- his ordination -rsb- there were 13 people , but most of them would have been around my age . "
last year a total of 564 men and women were recommended to train as clergy in the church of england , it says - an increase of more than 10 per cent compared to the 505 people recommended in 2003 .
but the 50-plus age group accounted for much of that increase - from 150 in 2003 to 210 in 2004 .
young clergy the church has launched a new initiative to get younger people interested in taking up vocations .
for example , clergy in their 20s will give presentations in parishes or university chaplaincies and careers fairs .
for mr boyd , also a civil servant at the department of work and pensions , the vocation was not something he was " seeking out or pursuing " .
" you know how sometimes you go into a supermarket and you know there 's something else you had to get but you ca n't put your finger on it ?
that 's how i felt . "
god creates us in his image , but gives us free will " father lee " i was something i worked through on my own and in prayer for a while and then the idea of ordination came up . "
he continued : " almost at every stage during the process i was expecting someone to say ' well actually we do n't think it 's quite the right thing ' .
" but i kept knocking on doors and doors kept opening . "
reflecting on what makes a good priest , father lee said : " you have to have a strong sense of being called .
" it is power over people , and it is how you exercise it . "
and , he said , part of the job was to reach out to all parts of the community .
" part of the beauty of the church of england is that it endeavours to be accessible to people .
" there are denominations that would be more restricting of people , whereas i think it is wonderful that the church of england does n't do that and that it is all-embracing .
" it rejoices in diverse ways and i think that 's right and good .
" god creates us in his image , but gives us free will . "

his ministry is spread across three churches , despite a six-year high last year in the number of men and women who decided to join the church of england clergy .
for the reverend martin lee life is busy .
he oversees three somerset parishes - brent knoll , east brent and lympsham .
in many ways they are thriving - they are wealthy villages , with a combined population of 3,500 .
his congregations range in size from about 55 to 75 .
but he is responsible for three parishes , when 20 years ago it would have been just one .
costly spire and like other rural communities , many young people are being forced to leave , priced out of the property market .
as a result villagers tend to be retired or " established " , or wealthy londoners buying second homes .
the three villages , all a stone 's throw from the m5 , also attract commuters who work in nearby bristol or taunton .
part of the beauty of the church of england is that it endeavours to be accessible to people father martin lee ln pictures : a vicar 's day more often than not , they work long hours and so do not always have the time to take part in church life , says father lee .
even so , he has plenty to do .
he sits on the board of governors for three schools and on the diocesan board of education .
on top of that , there are morning prayers , evening prayers , three sunday services , funerals , weddings , baptisms , church fetes , and day-to-day pastoral care .
there is also the small matter of raising the £ 36,000 a year " diocesan share " due to the diocese of bath and wells , the larger church regional area of which his parishes are a part .
only recently a massive fundraising mission in the community raised £ 200,000 to save east brent 's church - st mary in the virgin - after the dangerous state of its unusual 14th century spire left its future in doubt .
" the parish council spent a long time deciding whether to try and raise the funds or put the church in the hands of the redundant church society , " he said .
vicar shortage in the end they decided to try to save the church and the " tremendous " support from people showed they had made the right decision .
the church spire at east brent could have been the end for st mary 's the 18-month appeal revealed how the area valued the church , even if residents did not necessarily attend sunday service and donate to the weekly collection plate .
" they were hugely generous to us , " said father lee .
" the village gave over £ 60,000 and the rest came in grants .
that 's an awful lot . "
but , he says , in many ways the biggest threat to the church of england is a shortage of priests .
stuart boyd , 54 - father lee 's newly ordained curate , or assistant - agrees .
" one of the interesting things for me , for example on sunday -lsb- his ordination -rsb- there were 13 people , but most of them would have been around my age . "
last year a total of 564 men and women were recommended to train as clergy in the church of england , it says - an increase of more than 10 per cent compared to the 505 people recommended in 2003 .
but the 50-plus age group accounted for much of that increase - from 150 in 2003 to 210 in 2004 .
young clergy the church has launched a new initiative to get younger people interested in taking up vocations .
for example , clergy in their 20s will give presentations in parishes or university chaplaincies and careers fairs .
for mr boyd , also a civil servant at the department of work and pensions , the vocation was not something he was " seeking out or pursuing " .
" you know how sometimes you go into a supermarket and you know there 's something else you had to get but you ca n't put your finger on it ?
that 's how i felt .
god creates us in his image , but gives us free will father lee " i was something i worked through on my own and in prayer for a while and then the idea of ordination came up . "
he continued : " almost at every stage during the process i was expecting someone to say ' well actually we do n't think it 's quite the right thing ' .
" but i kept knocking on doors and doors kept opening . "
reflecting on what makes a good priest , father lee said : " you have to have a strong sense of being called .
" it is power over people , and it is how you exercise it . "
and , he said , part of the job was to reach out to all parts of the community .
" part of the beauty of the church of england is that it endeavours to be accessible to people .
" there are denominations that would be more restricting of people , whereas i think it is wonderful that the church of england does n't do that and that it is all-embracing .

he oversees three somerset parishes - brent knoll , east brent and lympsham .

" it is a very big thing for us - it is the first time they have returned since they were created , " she said .
during his visits to the area , she said turner mostly painted " on the spot scenes of mountains and of dolbadarn castle in llanberis " .
" he found the north wales scenery particularly inspiring , with the way the light and cloud interacted with the mountainscapes , " she said .
" it had a profound impact on the way he painted in the future .
" he was looking for that sense of excitement and beauty , and this is where he had that first kind of experience . "
turner was a regular visitor to wales in the 1790s , when the french revolutionary war made travel on the continent difficult , forcing british artists to explore scenery closer to home .
castle focus his first welsh tour took place in 1792 , when he visited south wales , before his second trip saw him visit flint and denbigh in 1794 .
he revisited south wales in the following year , before a comprehensive tour in 1798 when he took in the wye valley , cardigan , aberystwyth , snowdonia and llangollen .

just weeks after the attacks , events are starting to be held throughout the uk by a wide range of muslim groups .
the organisations represent a wide range of opinion - from pro-west reformers to those who say islam and democracy are incompatible .
the events have prompted more scholars to more directly address communities .
living islam the largest event is expected to see thousands of families attend the living islam festival in lincolnshire .
the annual event is organised by the islamic society of britain , an organisation which says it wants to strengthen the contribution of british muslims to society .
organiser jeffrey beere said this year 's event had taken on a crucial additional meaning .
" it is time for everyone to know what we really stand for , " he said .
" islam is the faith of 1.6 million britons .
its teachings fly in the face of the messages of hate that were behind the attacks on our capital .
this is an opportunity in a million , a chance to live the universal values of compassion and care and to provide our youth with a positive , wholesome self-image .
" it 's just what the muslim community needs right now . "
speakers include some of the most influential voices advocating a progressive application of islam in the western world .
radical party in london , a conference by a radical islamist organisation banned in some asian and middle eastern countries is expected to denounce us and british foreign policy .
soul searching at muslim festival hizb ut tahrir -lrb- ht -rrb- predicts more than 1,000 muslims will attend its event .
a previous conference attracted a similar-sized audience .
ht is considered to be on the fringe of islam in britain and its members believe that western society is incompatible with islam .
the political organisation 's primary aim is to establish a single islamic regime across the middle east .
jewish groups accuse it of anti-semitism , although the organisation itself insists it does not advocate violence .
dr imran waheed , a uk representative of the organisation , said : " over the last few weeks we have seen intense discussion about western foreign policy and the muslim world .
in an attempt to blur the debate , some politicians and media have equated muslim anger against western foreign policy as terrorism .
" in fact , the reality in the muslim world today , from tashkent to tripoli , is that the vast majority of work against western imperialism comes through non-violent political struggle . "
salafi lectures in yet another sign that full debate is taking place , followers of the salafi sect of islam , a conservative or " pure " reading of the faith , are organising lectures to speak against the attacks .
some western analysts have associated salafist thinking with al qaeda because some militant groups in the middle east describe themselves by the same name .
but british followers of the sect say the association is completely wrong because they themselves have been targeted by militants for speaking out .
scholars linked to birmingham-based salafi publications will explain why they say islam condemns suicide bombers as " perpetrators of evil " .
organisers are inviting non-muslims to also attend the lectures , starting with friday evening 's debate in bradford .
further debates will be held at mosques in birmingham and london throughout august .

just weeks after the attacks , events are starting to be held throughout the uk by a wide range of muslim groups .
the organisations represent a wide range of opinion - from pro-west reformers to those who say islam and democracy are incompatible .
the events have prompted more scholars to more directly address communities .
living islam the largest event is expected to see thousands of families attend the living islam festival in lincolnshire .
the annual event is organised by the islamic society of britain , an organisation which says it wants to strengthen the contribution of british muslims to society .
organiser jeffrey beere said this year 's event had taken on a crucial additional meaning .
" it is time for everyone to know what we really stand for , " he said .
" islam is the faith of 1.6 million britons .
its teachings fly in the face of the messages of hate that were behind the attacks on our capital .
this is an opportunity in a million , a chance to live the universal values of compassion and care and to provide our youth with a positive , wholesome self-image .
" it 's just what the muslim community needs right now . "
speakers include some of the most influential voices advocating a progressive application of islam in the western world .
radical party in london , a conference by a radical islamist organisation banned in some asian and middle eastern countries is expected to denounce us and british foreign policy .
soul searching at muslim festival hizb ut tahrir -lrb- ht -rrb- predicts more than 1,000 muslims will attend its event .
a previous conference attracted a similar-sized audience .
ht is considered to be on the fringe of islam in britain and its members believe that western society is incompatible with islam .
the political organisation 's primary aim is to establish a single islamic regime across the middle east .
jewish groups accuse it of anti-semitism , although the organisation itself insists it does not advocate violence .
dr imran waheed , a uk representative of the organisation , said : " over the last few weeks we have seen intense discussion about western foreign policy and the muslim world .
in an attempt to blur the debate , some politicians and media have equated muslim anger against western foreign policy as terrorism .
" in fact , the reality in the muslim world today , from tashkent to tripoli , is that the vast majority of work against western imperialism comes through non-violent political struggle . "
salafi lectures in yet another sign that full debate is taking place , followers of the salafi sect of islam , a conservative or " pure " reading of the faith , are organising lectures to speak against the attacks .
some western analysts have associated salafist thinking with al qaeda because some militant groups in the middle east describe themselves by the same name .
but british followers of the sect say the association is completely wrong because they themselves have been targeted by militants for speaking out .
scholars linked to birmingham-based salafi publications will explain why they say islam condemns suicide bombers as " perpetrators of evil " .
