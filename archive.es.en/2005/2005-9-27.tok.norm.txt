a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .

some contend that the public investment is therefore an inefficient expenditure . köhnke disagreed : knowledge of german and german culture can never be taken away from the asylum-seekers , he said .

more countries are banning smoking in public places , and tobacco advertising is on the decrease .
the industry is starting to get worried . it seems that everywhere you turn nowadays in europe , smoking is under attack .
norway , italy , ireland and most recently , sweden , have introduced bans on smoking in bars and restaurants .
higher tobacco taxes are leading to declining sales , as are eu-wide limits on tobacco advertising .
leading german politicians and european organizations have now begun campaigning for smoking to be off limits to the expected 3.37 million fans expected to file into world cup stadiums next june for the month-long tournament . and the world 's major tobacco companies seem worried not just about the decline in sales and ads , but in the flourishing black market for tobacco goods streaming in from eastern europe .
in the eastern part of germany , 30 percent of the total number of cigarettes sold are no longer taxed . ad and declining sales more damaging " in frankfurt an der oder , on the polish border , around 80 percent of the cigarettes no longer are taxed , " said lars grosskurth , spokesman for reemtsma , the daughter company of imperial tobacco , the fourth largest tobacco company in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packs of west cigarettes , a reemstma brand , after being seized at the german-polish border the black market puts a dent in sales , but potentially more damaging long term are the measures to stifle cigarette consumption .
packs in all eu countries now carry glaring black headlines warning smokers that nicotine can , among other things , reduce their sex drive , or kill them . such measures are already starting work .
according to the german cancer research institute in cologne , the number of cigarettes smoked dropped from 168 billion in 2002 to 148 billion 2004 , a reduction of 12 percent , the biggest in german history . germans lag behind but the german government itself is not helping much , say anti-tobacco organizations .
the country is one of the few to have not completely complied with the eu directive on tobacco advertising .
the social democrats blame the christian democratic party for blocking legislation in the upper house of parliament , but have also filed suit against the eu directive in the european court of justice saying such a directive is not within the union 's jurisdiction . but the government has signed an agreement with hotel and restaurant organizations that , while not completely banning it , will seek to curb smoking in those places . anti-smoking advocates seem to have increasing support for their work .
a recent survey revealed that 51 percent of germans are against a smoking ban .
in 2003 , it was 62 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes made by the hamburg firm reemstma is it time for tobacco companies to begin looking around for other ideas ?
british american tobacco is already diversified , having invested in paper factories , insurance firms and department stores in the 1960s and 1970s .
but spokesman rainer stubenvoll says his company is not running up the white flag just yet . " we 're a shareholder company , and the shareholder does n't want to see a mix from us , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.09.2005 eu tackles its own bureaucracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking to save some trees in a concerted drive to slash excessive red tape , the eu commission on tuesday abolished 68 rules the body believes are not only superfluous , but also harmful to the eu . the harmonization of sunday driving bans , flight attendent qualifications and the packing of coffee are only three of the almost 68 proposed regulations the eu commission views as senseless and detrimental to member states .
on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .
in the past years , there have been several attempts to tame the bureaucratic monster that consists of around 80,000 pages of legislation .
and eu citizens can do their bit to help too .
they can send recommendations to their representatives in brussels about where they can cut cumbersome rules . bernd riegert -lrb- jb / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu data-storage plan worries critics in a bid to more easily track criminals , the eu is proposing a unified plan to save telecommunications data across europe .

the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication . as expected , germany 's greens elected the left-leaning consumer affairs minister and one of the party 's chief strategists to lead the parliamentary faction of the party as it prepares to enter the opposition after seven years in government .

kuhn , a party veteran who briefly chaired the party with künast in 2000 , is known as one of the party 's power players and a close confidante of foreign minister joschka fischer . " they represent the entire spectrum that they need to reach out to , " said party researcher oskar niedermayer .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .
18 .
the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .

weitere tagesordnungspunkte der sitzung sind ein schärferes vorgehen gegen graffiti-sprayer und das umstrittene antidiskriminierungsgesetz .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .
many of dresden 's residents think that chancellor schröder and the social democrats are poor losers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " and what happens to me ? " reads the mock poster by the youth group of bavaria 's christian social union " well , we do n't have to do much at all right now , " lämmel said .
" schröder 's appearance on the night of the election , and the activities of the spd since then mean that i 'm having no problems with convincing people germany needs the cdu . " in a televised appearance on the night of the german election , schröder pushed forward his claim to chancellorship in a way which many observers found to be too belligerent .
but the social democrats are not the only rival that the cdu is facing .
the successors to the former communist party , the left party - formerly known as pds - is running neck and neck with the cdu .
in the bundestag elections , they won the vote of almost a quarter of electors in eastern germany . feeling important in dresden , residents are aware of how the rest of the country voted , and now the whole of germany wants to know how they will vote . " i think it 's great , " one voter said .
" i 've already sent off my postal vote and this time my choice was different from what i 'd originally planned .
it was more a case of seeing how everyone else voted and then deciding what to do . " bildunterschrift : one of them is bound to smile sunday night the coming weekend in dresden is bound to be filled with excitement .

the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication . as expected , germany 's greens elected the left-leaning consumer affairs minister and one of the party 's chief strategists to lead the parliamentary faction of the party as it prepares to enter the opposition after seven years in government .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .
in the past years , there have been several attempts to tame the bureaucratic monster that consists of around 80,000 pages of legislation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.09.2005 germany 's eyes set on dresden election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final election campaign storm is about to hit dresden these days , the eastern german city of dresden is the place to be : politicians , pop stars and athletes , not to mention an entire philharmonic orchestra , are flocking to the city where entertainment meets high politics . on the evening of oct.1 , the whole germany will be watching dresden - and not only because the old city looks so spectacular in the twilight .
on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .
18 .

the market is booming , driven mostly by business travelers and india 's rapidly growing middle-class in a population of more than one billion people .

because bargain airlines are starting up constantly , ticket prices are falling . deregulation leads to greater competition the current boom became possible after the indian government loosened its decades-old stranglehold on air travel .

modernization , less bureaucracy and partial-privatization are supposed to remove the brakes on growth . the government plans to expand the airports in bombay and delhi , the current hubs - and bottlenecks - of air traffic to india .

the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication . as expected , germany 's greens elected the left-leaning consumer affairs minister and one of the party 's chief strategists to lead the parliamentary faction of the party as it prepares to enter the opposition after seven years in government .

künast is traditionally an acolyte of the leftist , ecological wing of the party .
kuhn , a party veteran who briefly chaired the party with künast in 2000 , is known as one of the party 's power players and a close confidante of foreign minister joschka fischer . " they represent the entire spectrum that they need to reach out to , " said party researcher oskar niedermayer .

but after entering the government coalition in 1998 , they were almost immediately forced to make compromises considered by many to be impossible .
over the complaints of many party veterans , fischer , who had emerged as the green 's strong man after becoming the first green minister , -lrb- taking over the environmental post in hesse in 1984 -rrb- , wrangled the party leadership and pacifist base into approving the deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in kosovo and macedonia in 1999 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , after the paint attack on the green party special congress on the kosovo war he did n't come away untouched .

they pushed german utilities into agreeing to a gradual phase-out of nuclear energy in the next 20 years , in favor of alternative energy sources .
it was the greens ' resolve that got a same-sex marriage bill made into law . but the greens also lost regional and state elections , and , when they were voted out along with the spd in this may 's elections in north rhine-westphalia , it left germany without an spd-green coalition in any of its 16 states .
last wednesday , fischer placed a further burden on the party when he chose to fade into the back rows of parliament . " it 's … difficult for the outward appearance of the party , because fischer dominated that , " said niedermayer , a professor at the freie university in berlin .
" they need to now replace this father figure , with a collective of parents , and that will be difficult . " focus on the economy the burden rests on künast and kuhn 's shoulders .
the pair have already identified the first priority : figuring out where the greens stand on reforming germany .
in brief remarks after his election , kuhn , the party 's economic and tax expert , said the greens would work for more economic efficiency , jobs and social justice in the reforms . niedermayer added that the party should also think about shoring up its power base as germany ages by tweaking the party platform to attract older voters .

the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication . as expected , germany 's greens elected the left-leaning consumer affairs minister and one of the party 's chief strategists to lead the parliamentary faction of the party as it prepares to enter the opposition after seven years in government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuhn -lrb- l . -rrb- and künast are the new leaders the selection of minister renate künast , who immediately resigned her office upon being elected tuesday afternoon , and fritz kuhn indicates an effort by the party to reach out to its various voter blocs .
künast is traditionally an acolyte of the leftist , ecological wing of the party .
kuhn , a party veteran who briefly chaired the party with künast in 2000 , is known as one of the party 's power players and a close confidante of foreign minister joschka fischer . " they represent the entire spectrum that they need to reach out to , " said party researcher oskar niedermayer .
" it 's a man and woman combination , and they represent the left and the middle . " step in the opposition at a time when the greens are casting about for solid ground , the selection of the two suggests a continuance of the power politics foisted on the party by fischer , who announced last week that he would not lead the party in the parliamentary opposition . after seven years helping chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats rule the country , the greens face a different future after germans voted out the coalition government on sept .

the party did n't help its own cause , dropping three seats in the bundestag , pushing them behind the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party as the parliament 's fifth-strongest party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called jamaica coalition , with the conservative union parties and the fdp is likely out of the question though some factions of the party continue to flirt with the conservative christian democratic union and the fdp in hopes of forming a three-party ruling coalition , most of the greens have begun to steel themselves for a return to the opposition role they held for decades . " it is time for us greens to take a new step , one into the opposition , " said künast , after her election . fischer 's paint bomb attack born out of a mix of anti-war and ecological movements in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the greens gave voice to a swath of germans who felt unrepresented by the unionist social democrats and the conservative christian democratic union in the 1980s .
but after entering the government coalition in 1998 , they were almost immediately forced to make compromises considered by many to be impossible .
over the complaints of many party veterans , fischer , who had emerged as the green 's strong man after becoming the first green minister , -lrb- taking over the environmental post in hesse in 1984 -rrb- , wrangled the party leadership and pacifist base into approving the deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in kosovo and macedonia in 1999 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , after the paint attack on the green party special congress on the kosovo war he did n't come away untouched .

it was the greens ' resolve that got a same-sex marriage bill made into law . but the greens also lost regional and state elections , and , when they were voted out along with the spd in this may 's elections in north rhine-westphalia , it left germany without an spd-green coalition in any of its 16 states .
last wednesday , fischer placed a further burden on the party when he chose to fade into the back rows of parliament . " it 's … difficult for the outward appearance of the party , because fischer dominated that , " said niedermayer , a professor at the freie university in berlin .
" they need to now replace this father figure , with a collective of parents , and that will be difficult . " focus on the economy the burden rests on künast and kuhn 's shoulders .
the pair have already identified the first priority : figuring out where the greens stand on reforming germany .
in brief remarks after his election , kuhn , the party 's economic and tax expert , said the greens would work for more economic efficiency , jobs and social justice in the reforms . niedermayer added that the party should also think about shoring up its power base as germany ages by tweaking the party platform to attract older voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.09.2005 germany 's lufthansa eyes india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa 's lining up to fly to india more frequently lufthansa wants to expand into india , the country with the world 's second largest population : india offers not only inexpensive labor for foreign investors but also is becoming more attractive as a market . lufthansa currently connects germany and india 38 times a week , the most of any european airline and two-thirds more flights than as recently as 2003 .
the market is booming , driven mostly by business travelers and india 's rapidly growing middle-class in a population of more than one billion people .
lufthansa views the asian sub-continent and 150 million potential customers more and more positively . " it 's an enormous number , " said werner heesen , lufthansa 's director for south asia .
" india 's economic development has caused the buying power to jump incredibly .
the money is now there meaning that an increasing number of people can afford to fly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gateway of india in bombay , a city that is the hub and bottleneck of air travel to india there is room for growth .
until now , no more than seven million indians fly regularly .
however , if the country 's domestic flights are added to the picture , the number leaps to a market of 250 million passengers .
because bargain airlines are starting up constantly , ticket prices are falling . deregulation leads to greater competition the current boom became possible after the indian government loosened its decades-old stranglehold on air travel .
with 20 percent annual growth , the indian market is , in the words of airline expert kapil kaul , " breathtaking compared to the rest of the world . "
he compares the market to a sleeper who suddenly awoke and began to run a marathon . kaul fears thought that the south asian market could become overheated .
there is a shortage of some 300 pilots which in the next five years could balloon to 4000 .
with similar developments for aircraft engineers and air traffic controllers in the offing , " a huge problem is developing - and nobody has an answer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner heesen -lrb- l -rrb- , passenger sales lufthansa india & director southasia , announcing new plans for indian flights earlier this year a lack of trained personnel is n't the only dilemma in the near future .
there 's also a completely inadequate infrastructure .
above all , india 's metropolitan airports are close to collapse because they are too small . " even major cities like delhi , mumbai and bangalore have only one take-off and landing strip , " said lufthansa 's heesen . air traffic is being slowed by an airport capacity that was built for seven million passengers and not 250 million , creating for lufthansa and other large european carriers the biggest " natural limitation . " modernization in the works still , the ambitious indian government promises improvements .
modernization , less bureaucracy and partial-privatization are supposed to remove the brakes on growth . the government plans to expand the airports in bombay and delhi , the current hubs - and bottlenecks - of air traffic to india .
once those expansions are completed , it 's still unclear when that will be , then carriers will find it easier to bring their passengers to the desired destinations in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baggage workers in india will have more to do in the future " even now when flights are distributed to other cities , the infrastructure can deal with the increasing traffic , " said india 's air traffic minister praful patel . most industry analysts believe the government will succeed in improving conditions .
until 2010 , however , those traveling to the sub-continent will run across many construction sites at indian airports .
those temporary inconveniences are the starting blocks for the race , and then , according to kaul , india will experience incredible growth . christoph heinzle -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moving german service to foreign shores outsourcing has become standard in manufacturing .

the market is booming , driven mostly by business travelers and india 's rapidly growing middle-class in a population of more than one billion people .
lufthansa views the asian sub-continent and 150 million potential customers more and more positively . " it 's an enormous number , " said werner heesen , lufthansa 's director for south asia .

until now , no more than seven million indians fly regularly .
however , if the country 's domestic flights are added to the picture , the number leaps to a market of 250 million passengers .
because bargain airlines are starting up constantly , ticket prices are falling . deregulation leads to greater competition the current boom became possible after the indian government loosened its decades-old stranglehold on air travel .
with 20 percent annual growth , the indian market is , in the words of airline expert kapil kaul , " breathtaking compared to the rest of the world . "

" even major cities like delhi , mumbai and bangalore have only one take-off and landing strip , " said lufthansa 's heesen . air traffic is being slowed by an airport capacity that was built for seven million passengers and not 250 million , creating for lufthansa and other large european carriers the biggest " natural limitation . " modernization in the works still , the ambitious indian government promises improvements .
modernization , less bureaucracy and partial-privatization are supposed to remove the brakes on growth . the government plans to expand the airports in bombay and delhi , the current hubs - and bottlenecks - of air traffic to india .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.09.2005 germany 's lufthansa eyes india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa 's lining up to fly to india more frequently lufthansa wants to expand into india , the country with the world 's second largest population : india offers not only inexpensive labor for foreign investors but also is becoming more attractive as a market . lufthansa currently connects germany and india 38 times a week , the most of any european airline and two-thirds more flights than as recently as 2003 .
the market is booming , driven mostly by business travelers and india 's rapidly growing middle-class in a population of more than one billion people .
lufthansa views the asian sub-continent and 150 million potential customers more and more positively . " it 's an enormous number , " said werner heesen , lufthansa 's director for south asia .
" india 's economic development has caused the buying power to jump incredibly .
the money is now there meaning that an increasing number of people can afford to fly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gateway of india in bombay , a city that is the hub and bottleneck of air travel to india there is room for growth .
until now , no more than seven million indians fly regularly .
however , if the country 's domestic flights are added to the picture , the number leaps to a market of 250 million passengers .
because bargain airlines are starting up constantly , ticket prices are falling . deregulation leads to greater competition the current boom became possible after the indian government loosened its decades-old stranglehold on air travel .
with 20 percent annual growth , the indian market is , in the words of airline expert kapil kaul , " breathtaking compared to the rest of the world . "
he compares the market to a sleeper who suddenly awoke and began to run a marathon . kaul fears thought that the south asian market could become overheated .
there is a shortage of some 300 pilots which in the next five years could balloon to 4000 .
with similar developments for aircraft engineers and air traffic controllers in the offing , " a huge problem is developing - and nobody has an answer . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner heesen -lrb- l -rrb- , passenger sales lufthansa india & director southasia , announcing new plans for indian flights earlier this year a lack of trained personnel is n't the only dilemma in the near future .
there 's also a completely inadequate infrastructure .
above all , india 's metropolitan airports are close to collapse because they are too small . " even major cities like delhi , mumbai and bangalore have only one take-off and landing strip , " said lufthansa 's heesen . air traffic is being slowed by an airport capacity that was built for seven million passengers and not 250 million , creating for lufthansa and other large european carriers the biggest " natural limitation . " modernization in the works still , the ambitious indian government promises improvements .
modernization , less bureaucracy and partial-privatization are supposed to remove the brakes on growth . the government plans to expand the airports in bombay and delhi , the current hubs - and bottlenecks - of air traffic to india .
once those expansions are completed , it 's still unclear when that will be , then carriers will find it easier to bring their passengers to the desired destinations in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baggage workers in india will have more to do in the future " even now when flights are distributed to other cities , the infrastructure can deal with the increasing traffic , " said india 's air traffic minister praful patel . most industry analysts believe the government will succeed in improving conditions .
until 2010 , however , those traveling to the sub-continent will run across many construction sites at indian airports .

not yet consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal . one day before a new round of top-level exploratory talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's conservative christian union alliance on forming a governing coalition , leading figures in the two blocs said they were finding common ground . bavarian premier edmund stoiber , one of germany 's most powerful conservative regional leaders , offered a vote of confidence in a grand coalition by saying he hoped to join such a government as a cabinet member . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel " first the union and the spd must agree on a stable government with a reasonable program , " stoiber told the mass-selling bild newspaper .
" then i could imagine assuming responsibility in such a cabinet .

not yet consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal . one day before a new round of top-level exploratory talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's conservative christian union alliance on forming a governing coalition , leading figures in the two blocs said they were finding common ground . bavarian premier edmund stoiber , one of germany 's most powerful conservative regional leaders , offered a vote of confidence in a grand coalition by saying he hoped to join such a government as a cabinet member . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel " first the union and the spd must agree on a stable government with a reasonable program , " stoiber told the mass-selling bild newspaper .
" then i could imagine assuming responsibility in such a cabinet . " economy minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats told ard public television that his party would work with the conservatives on outlining fiscal and labor market policies to tackle the mounting public debt and 11.4-percent jobless rate . he said those problems took priority over the " personnel " issue - who would win the chancellery . cdu insists on merkel the sept .
18 election left germany at a political impasse after voters failed to give either of the main blocs a ruling majority . the christian union won a three-seat lead over the social democrats but the narrow result left both merkel and schröder claiming a mandate to be germany 's next leader . merkel said monday that the social democrats would have to accept the christian union 's right to choose the chancellor before coalition negotiations could begin . spd leaders continued to resist , saying that they would enter the talks with the aim of seeing schroeder confirmed for a third term . will schröder budge ? but some social democrats cautiously hinted that schröder could bow out in the interest of an agreement with the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler " if he -lrb- schröder -rrb- for some reason said , ' i agree with what is coming together and perhaps someone needs to budge on the personnel issue ' , then we would accept that , " the deputy head of the spd parliamentary group , gernot erler , told ard . analysts predicted the first real movement on the tentative negotiations next week , after a district in the eastern city of dresden casts its ballots in the general election .

schröder 's strategy of clinging to power was seen largely as a bluff aimed at strengthening his party 's position ahead of what is sure to be intense horse-trading . " a few days after the election in dresden , schröder can say , ' in the interest of the country , in the interest of the common good , i 'll clear the way for merkel ' , " political scientist peter lösche of the university of göttingen told rolling news channel n24 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder sticks to leadership claim chancellor schröder on sunday resisted mounting pressure to step aside to break the political deadlock gripping germany following an inconclusive general election one week ago .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .
18 .
the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .
der bundestag berät unter anderem über verschiedene arbeitsmarktreformen .
weitere tagesordnungspunkte der sitzung sind ein schärferes vorgehen gegen graffiti-sprayer und das umstrittene antidiskriminierungsgesetz .
foto : marcel mettelsiefen dpa / lbn + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - report + + + , .bundestag , .parlament , .politik , abgeordnete , leer , plenarsaal , reichstag , wenige , empty , lower _ house of federal german parliament , parliament , pol , politics but it is unlikely that the elections in dresden will tip the scales in the german parliament , where angela merkel 's conservative coalition -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- has a three-seat advantage over chancellor schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .
many of dresden 's residents think that chancellor schröder and the social democrats are poor losers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " and what happens to me ? " reads the mock poster by the youth group of bavaria 's christian social union " well , we do n't have to do much at all right now , " lämmel said .
" schröder 's appearance on the night of the election , and the activities of the spd since then mean that i 'm having no problems with convincing people germany needs the cdu . " in a televised appearance on the night of the german election , schröder pushed forward his claim to chancellorship in a way which many observers found to be too belligerent .
but the social democrats are not the only rival that the cdu is facing .

the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .

" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .

his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .

the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .
der bundestag berät unter anderem über verschiedene arbeitsmarktreformen .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .
despite having taken great strides to improve the chances for asylum-seekers , there is no minimum standard for the living quarters provided by the state for displaced persons . the result is that the vast majority of asylum-seekers are housed in compounds that look like barracks , often surrounded by barbed wire , a virtual internment camp cut off from the german society and without opportunities for integration . the city of münster , in the heart of westphalia in western germany , has taken the initiative to improve the standards for integrating asylum seekers through new concepts in housing .
two housing units have already been built which are located within a neighborhood , easing the opportunities for contact with the locals .
a third one is in the works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living in albachten : better than before the new housing complexes offer immigrants professional and volunteer social workers for advice on everything from legal issues to finding work .
the special care allows immigrants like suljo berisha , who escaped with three generations of his family from war-torn kosovo in the late 1990s , to feel at home in germany for the first time . home sweet albachten until recently berisha lived with his family in a container-style housing project on the edge of town .
now berisha has moved into the new apartments in the south-western suburb of albachten .
the new housing fits in with the surrounding architecture , and offers the look , at least , of integration .
berisha is enthusiastic . " here in albachten things are better , " berisha said .
" we must be thankful for the care received by my children .
the rooms are larger in albachten , too .
everything has gotten better since we moved here . " bildunterschrift : the new apartments are downright cozy the four new single-family row houses offer 50 asylum-seekers a place to call home .
their high quality attracted the attention of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , who praised the münster model .
the city of münster 's department for resettled ethnic germans -lrb- aussiedler -rrb- , refugees and asylum-seekers ' jochen köhnke welcomed the social benefits of the new housing project . " in contrast to the large-scale , institutionalized housing , we notice that the new apartments allow for a sense of civil society to develop , " he said .
" we have volunteers from within the immigrant community supporting the social work of our office , and quite a number of immigrants have been adopted by the local community . " the positive results also carried over to the children of the refugees , he added . " we are seeing promising developments in the schools , too , " köhnke said .
" the children are not just going more regularly to school , they are also able to enter the class appropriate for their age and thrive there .
our office is pleased . " a return to normalcy in the albachten housing units , the immigrants ' children help one another with homework .
the mothers have the opportunity to take german classes while their babies are in day care .
the high demand for german classes encourages volunteer teachers such as gisela wedig to carry on with their work . " we have seen that five days after giving birth , the women come back to our classes .
this inspires us to keep on with it , " wedig said .
" we accompany parents to school open house because the parents often have trouble understanding teachers , and vice versa , " she said . it was not always this way .
the eased integration offered by the volunteer teachers is not merely a service .
strong bonds have been formed and even friendships flourish between the münster natives and the newcomers .
the new housing units together with gradually improving initiatives for social integration are allowing for an improvement in the quality of life enjoyed by the immigrant community . not all peaches and cream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitchens in albachten come fully equipped though the münster model has received accolades from human rights activists , there are naturally detractors of the system as well .
the high quality of the housing and social care offered to refugees in münster cut deeply into the city 's public funds .
after receiving excellent care , learning the german language and starting on the long road to integration , their applications for a residency permit often fail .
some contend that the public investment is therefore an inefficient expenditure . köhnke disagreed : knowledge of german and german culture can never be taken away from the asylum-seekers , he said .
even if their bid for amnesty is not accepted and the families must return to their homeland , the immigrants will have profited from their time in germany . at least for the time being , many residents of the new immigrant housing seem to be content .
living in a neighborly environment fosters neighborly interactions .

the market is booming , driven mostly by business travelers and india 's rapidly growing middle-class in a population of more than one billion people .
lufthansa views the asian sub-continent and 150 million potential customers more and more positively . " it 's an enormous number , " said werner heesen , lufthansa 's director for south asia .
" india 's economic development has caused the buying power to jump incredibly .
the money is now there meaning that an increasing number of people can afford to fly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gateway of india in bombay , a city that is the hub and bottleneck of air travel to india there is room for growth .
until now , no more than seven million indians fly regularly .
however , if the country 's domestic flights are added to the picture , the number leaps to a market of 250 million passengers .
because bargain airlines are starting up constantly , ticket prices are falling . deregulation leads to greater competition the current boom became possible after the indian government loosened its decades-old stranglehold on air travel .
with 20 percent annual growth , the indian market is , in the words of airline expert kapil kaul , " breathtaking compared to the rest of the world . "
he compares the market to a sleeper who suddenly awoke and began to run a marathon . kaul fears thought that the south asian market could become overheated .
there is a shortage of some 300 pilots which in the next five years could balloon to 4000 .
with similar developments for aircraft engineers and air traffic controllers in the offing , " a huge problem is developing - and nobody has an answer .

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .
despite having taken great strides to improve the chances for asylum-seekers , there is no minimum standard for the living quarters provided by the state for displaced persons . the result is that the vast majority of asylum-seekers are housed in compounds that look like barracks , often surrounded by barbed wire , a virtual internment camp cut off from the german society and without opportunities for integration . the city of münster , in the heart of westphalia in western germany , has taken the initiative to improve the standards for integrating asylum seekers through new concepts in housing .

" in contrast to the large-scale , institutionalized housing , we notice that the new apartments allow for a sense of civil society to develop , " he said .

some contend that the public investment is therefore an inefficient expenditure . köhnke disagreed : knowledge of german and german culture can never be taken away from the asylum-seekers , he said .

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .

the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .
many of dresden 's residents think that chancellor schröder and the social democrats are poor losers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " and what happens to me ? " reads the mock poster by the youth group of bavaria 's christian social union " well , we do n't have to do much at all right now , " lämmel said .
" schröder 's appearance on the night of the election , and the activities of the spd since then mean that i 'm having no problems with convincing people germany needs the cdu . " in a televised appearance on the night of the german election , schröder pushed forward his claim to chancellorship in a way which many observers found to be too belligerent .
but the social democrats are not the only rival that the cdu is facing .
the successors to the former communist party , the left party - formerly known as pds - is running neck and neck with the cdu .
in the bundestag elections , they won the vote of almost a quarter of electors in eastern germany . feeling important in dresden , residents are aware of how the rest of the country voted , and now the whole of germany wants to know how they will vote . " i think it 's great , " one voter said .
" i 've already sent off my postal vote and this time my choice was different from what i 'd originally planned .
it was more a case of seeing how everyone else voted and then deciding what to do . " bildunterschrift : one of them is bound to smile sunday night the coming weekend in dresden is bound to be filled with excitement .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .
many of dresden 's residents think that chancellor schröder and the social democrats are poor losers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " and what happens to me ? " reads the mock poster by the youth group of bavaria 's christian social union " well , we do n't have to do much at all right now , " lämmel said .
" schröder 's appearance on the night of the election , and the activities of the spd since then mean that i 'm having no problems with convincing people germany needs the cdu . " in a televised appearance on the night of the german election , schröder pushed forward his claim to chancellorship in a way which many observers found to be too belligerent .
but the social democrats are not the only rival that the cdu is facing .
the successors to the former communist party , the left party - formerly known as pds - is running neck and neck with the cdu .
in the bundestag elections , they won the vote of almost a quarter of electors in eastern germany . feeling important in dresden , residents are aware of how the rest of the country voted , and now the whole of germany wants to know how they will vote . " i think it 's great , " one voter said .
" i 've already sent off my postal vote and this time my choice was different from what i 'd originally planned .
it was more a case of seeing how everyone else voted and then deciding what to do . " bildunterschrift : one of them is bound to smile sunday night the coming weekend in dresden is bound to be filled with excitement .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .
in the past years , there have been several attempts to tame the bureaucratic monster that consists of around 80,000 pages of legislation .
and eu citizens can do their bit to help too .

the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .

" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people .

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .
despite having taken great strides to improve the chances for asylum-seekers , there is no minimum standard for the living quarters provided by the state for displaced persons . the result is that the vast majority of asylum-seekers are housed in compounds that look like barracks , often surrounded by barbed wire , a virtual internment camp cut off from the german society and without opportunities for integration . the city of münster , in the heart of westphalia in western germany , has taken the initiative to improve the standards for integrating asylum seekers through new concepts in housing .
two housing units have already been built which are located within a neighborhood , easing the opportunities for contact with the locals .
a third one is in the works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living in albachten : better than before the new housing complexes offer immigrants professional and volunteer social workers for advice on everything from legal issues to finding work .
the special care allows immigrants like suljo berisha , who escaped with three generations of his family from war-torn kosovo in the late 1990s , to feel at home in germany for the first time . home sweet albachten until recently berisha lived with his family in a container-style housing project on the edge of town .
now berisha has moved into the new apartments in the south-western suburb of albachten .
the new housing fits in with the surrounding architecture , and offers the look , at least , of integration .
berisha is enthusiastic . " here in albachten things are better , " berisha said .
" we must be thankful for the care received by my children .
the rooms are larger in albachten , too .
everything has gotten better since we moved here . " bildunterschrift : the new apartments are downright cozy the four new single-family row houses offer 50 asylum-seekers a place to call home .
their high quality attracted the attention of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , who praised the münster model .
the city of münster 's department for resettled ethnic germans -lrb- aussiedler -rrb- , refugees and asylum-seekers ' jochen köhnke welcomed the social benefits of the new housing project . " in contrast to the large-scale , institutionalized housing , we notice that the new apartments allow for a sense of civil society to develop , " he said .
" we have volunteers from within the immigrant community supporting the social work of our office , and quite a number of immigrants have been adopted by the local community . " the positive results also carried over to the children of the refugees , he added . " we are seeing promising developments in the schools , too , " köhnke said .
" the children are not just going more regularly to school , they are also able to enter the class appropriate for their age and thrive there .
our office is pleased . " a return to normalcy in the albachten housing units , the immigrants ' children help one another with homework .
the mothers have the opportunity to take german classes while their babies are in day care .
the high demand for german classes encourages volunteer teachers such as gisela wedig to carry on with their work . " we have seen that five days after giving birth , the women come back to our classes .
this inspires us to keep on with it , " wedig said .
" we accompany parents to school open house because the parents often have trouble understanding teachers , and vice versa , " she said . it was not always this way .
the eased integration offered by the volunteer teachers is not merely a service .
strong bonds have been formed and even friendships flourish between the münster natives and the newcomers .
the new housing units together with gradually improving initiatives for social integration are allowing for an improvement in the quality of life enjoyed by the immigrant community . not all peaches and cream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitchens in albachten come fully equipped though the münster model has received accolades from human rights activists , there are naturally detractors of the system as well .
the high quality of the housing and social care offered to refugees in münster cut deeply into the city 's public funds .
after receiving excellent care , learning the german language and starting on the long road to integration , their applications for a residency permit often fail .
some contend that the public investment is therefore an inefficient expenditure . köhnke disagreed : knowledge of german and german culture can never be taken away from the asylum-seekers , he said .
even if their bid for amnesty is not accepted and the families must return to their homeland , the immigrants will have profited from their time in germany . at least for the time being , many residents of the new immigrant housing seem to be content .
living in a neighborly environment fosters neighborly interactions .
suljo berisha is happy with the overall friendliness of his daily interactions . " we never meet a neighbor without saying ' hello ' , or ' good evening ' , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ?

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .
despite having taken great strides to improve the chances for asylum-seekers , there is no minimum standard for the living quarters provided by the state for displaced persons . the result is that the vast majority of asylum-seekers are housed in compounds that look like barracks , often surrounded by barbed wire , a virtual internment camp cut off from the german society and without opportunities for integration . the city of münster , in the heart of westphalia in western germany , has taken the initiative to improve the standards for integrating asylum seekers through new concepts in housing .
two housing units have already been built which are located within a neighborhood , easing the opportunities for contact with the locals .
a third one is in the works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living in albachten : better than before the new housing complexes offer immigrants professional and volunteer social workers for advice on everything from legal issues to finding work .
the special care allows immigrants like suljo berisha , who escaped with three generations of his family from war-torn kosovo in the late 1990s , to feel at home in germany for the first time . home sweet albachten until recently berisha lived with his family in a container-style housing project on the edge of town .
now berisha has moved into the new apartments in the south-western suburb of albachten .
the new housing fits in with the surrounding architecture , and offers the look , at least , of integration .
berisha is enthusiastic . " here in albachten things are better , " berisha said .
" we must be thankful for the care received by my children .
the rooms are larger in albachten , too .
everything has gotten better since we moved here . " bildunterschrift : the new apartments are downright cozy the four new single-family row houses offer 50 asylum-seekers a place to call home .
their high quality attracted the attention of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , who praised the münster model .
the city of münster 's department for resettled ethnic germans -lrb- aussiedler -rrb- , refugees and asylum-seekers ' jochen köhnke welcomed the social benefits of the new housing project . " in contrast to the large-scale , institutionalized housing , we notice that the new apartments allow for a sense of civil society to develop , " he said .
" we have volunteers from within the immigrant community supporting the social work of our office , and quite a number of immigrants have been adopted by the local community . " the positive results also carried over to the children of the refugees , he added . " we are seeing promising developments in the schools , too , " köhnke said .
" the children are not just going more regularly to school , they are also able to enter the class appropriate for their age and thrive there .
our office is pleased . " a return to normalcy in the albachten housing units , the immigrants ' children help one another with homework .
the mothers have the opportunity to take german classes while their babies are in day care .
the high demand for german classes encourages volunteer teachers such as gisela wedig to carry on with their work . " we have seen that five days after giving birth , the women come back to our classes .
this inspires us to keep on with it , " wedig said .
" we accompany parents to school open house because the parents often have trouble understanding teachers , and vice versa , " she said . it was not always this way .
the eased integration offered by the volunteer teachers is not merely a service .
strong bonds have been formed and even friendships flourish between the münster natives and the newcomers .
the new housing units together with gradually improving initiatives for social integration are allowing for an improvement in the quality of life enjoyed by the immigrant community . not all peaches and cream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitchens in albachten come fully equipped though the münster model has received accolades from human rights activists , there are naturally detractors of the system as well .
the high quality of the housing and social care offered to refugees in münster cut deeply into the city 's public funds .
after receiving excellent care , learning the german language and starting on the long road to integration , their applications for a residency permit often fail .
some contend that the public investment is therefore an inefficient expenditure . köhnke disagreed : knowledge of german and german culture can never be taken away from the asylum-seekers , he said .
even if their bid for amnesty is not accepted and the families must return to their homeland , the immigrants will have profited from their time in germany . at least for the time being , many residents of the new immigrant housing seem to be content .
living in a neighborly environment fosters neighborly interactions .
suljo berisha is happy with the overall friendliness of his daily interactions .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .

the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .

the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .

" those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .

more countries are banning smoking in public places , and tobacco advertising is on the decrease .
the industry is starting to get worried . it seems that everywhere you turn nowadays in europe , smoking is under attack .
norway , italy , ireland and most recently , sweden , have introduced bans on smoking in bars and restaurants .
higher tobacco taxes are leading to declining sales , as are eu-wide limits on tobacco advertising .
leading german politicians and european organizations have now begun campaigning for smoking to be off limits to the expected 3.37 million fans expected to file into world cup stadiums next june for the month-long tournament . and the world 's major tobacco companies seem worried not just about the decline in sales and ads , but in the flourishing black market for tobacco goods streaming in from eastern europe .
in the eastern part of germany , 30 percent of the total number of cigarettes sold are no longer taxed . ad and declining sales more damaging " in frankfurt an der oder , on the polish border , around 80 percent of the cigarettes no longer are taxed , " said lars grosskurth , spokesman for reemtsma , the daughter company of imperial tobacco , the fourth largest tobacco company in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packs of west cigarettes , a reemstma brand , after being seized at the german-polish border the black market puts a dent in sales , but potentially more damaging long term are the measures to stifle cigarette consumption .
packs in all eu countries now carry glaring black headlines warning smokers that nicotine can , among other things , reduce their sex drive , or kill them . such measures are already starting work .
according to the german cancer research institute in cologne , the number of cigarettes smoked dropped from 168 billion in 2002 to 148 billion 2004 , a reduction of 12 percent , the biggest in german history . germans lag behind but the german government itself is not helping much , say anti-tobacco organizations .
the country is one of the few to have not completely complied with the eu directive on tobacco advertising .
the social democrats blame the christian democratic party for blocking legislation in the upper house of parliament , but have also filed suit against the eu directive in the european court of justice saying such a directive is not within the union 's jurisdiction . but the government has signed an agreement with hotel and restaurant organizations that , while not completely banning it , will seek to curb smoking in those places . anti-smoking advocates seem to have increasing support for their work .
a recent survey revealed that 51 percent of germans are against a smoking ban .
in 2003 , it was 62 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes made by the hamburg firm reemstma is it time for tobacco companies to begin looking around for other ideas ?
british american tobacco is already diversified , having invested in paper factories , insurance firms and department stores in the 1960s and 1970s .
but spokesman rainer stubenvoll says his company is not running up the white flag just yet . " we 're a shareholder company , and the shareholder does n't want to see a mix from us , " he said .
" they want to see the clear orientation of bat as a tobacco company .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .
18 .
the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .
der bundestag berät unter anderem über verschiedene arbeitsmarktreformen .
weitere tagesordnungspunkte der sitzung sind ein schärferes vorgehen gegen graffiti-sprayer und das umstrittene antidiskriminierungsgesetz .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .
many of dresden 's residents think that chancellor schröder and the social democrats are poor losers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " and what happens to me ? " reads the mock poster by the youth group of bavaria 's christian social union " well , we do n't have to do much at all right now , " lämmel said .
" schröder 's appearance on the night of the election , and the activities of the spd since then mean that i 'm having no problems with convincing people germany needs the cdu . " in a televised appearance on the night of the german election , schröder pushed forward his claim to chancellorship in a way which many observers found to be too belligerent .
but the social democrats are not the only rival that the cdu is facing .
the successors to the former communist party , the left party - formerly known as pds - is running neck and neck with the cdu .
in the bundestag elections , they won the vote of almost a quarter of electors in eastern germany . feeling important in dresden , residents are aware of how the rest of the country voted , and now the whole of germany wants to know how they will vote . " i think it 's great , " one voter said .
" i 've already sent off my postal vote and this time my choice was different from what i 'd originally planned .
it was more a case of seeing how everyone else voted and then deciding what to do . " bildunterschrift : one of them is bound to smile sunday night the coming weekend in dresden is bound to be filled with excitement .
although nobody - not even thomas gottschalk - will dare to bet on the outcome . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu , spd search for common ground consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal .

not yet consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal . one day before a new round of top-level exploratory talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's conservative christian union alliance on forming a governing coalition , leading figures in the two blocs said they were finding common ground . bavarian premier edmund stoiber , one of germany 's most powerful conservative regional leaders , offered a vote of confidence in a grand coalition by saying he hoped to join such a government as a cabinet member . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel " first the union and the spd must agree on a stable government with a reasonable program , " stoiber told the mass-selling bild newspaper .
" then i could imagine assuming responsibility in such a cabinet .

not yet consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal . one day before a new round of top-level exploratory talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's conservative christian union alliance on forming a governing coalition , leading figures in the two blocs said they were finding common ground . bavarian premier edmund stoiber , one of germany 's most powerful conservative regional leaders , offered a vote of confidence in a grand coalition by saying he hoped to join such a government as a cabinet member . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel " first the union and the spd must agree on a stable government with a reasonable program , " stoiber told the mass-selling bild newspaper .
" then i could imagine assuming responsibility in such a cabinet . " economy minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats told ard public television that his party would work with the conservatives on outlining fiscal and labor market policies to tackle the mounting public debt and 11.4-percent jobless rate . he said those problems took priority over the " personnel " issue - who would win the chancellery . cdu insists on merkel the sept .
18 election left germany at a political impasse after voters failed to give either of the main blocs a ruling majority . the christian union won a three-seat lead over the social democrats but the narrow result left both merkel and schröder claiming a mandate to be germany 's next leader . merkel said monday that the social democrats would have to accept the christian union 's right to choose the chancellor before coalition negotiations could begin . spd leaders continued to resist , saying that they would enter the talks with the aim of seeing schroeder confirmed for a third term . will schröder budge ? but some social democrats cautiously hinted that schröder could bow out in the interest of an agreement with the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler " if he -lrb- schröder -rrb- for some reason said , ' i agree with what is coming together and perhaps someone needs to budge on the personnel issue ' , then we would accept that , " the deputy head of the spd parliamentary group , gernot erler , told ard . analysts predicted the first real movement on the tentative negotiations next week , after a district in the eastern city of dresden casts its ballots in the general election .

the market is booming , driven mostly by business travelers and india 's rapidly growing middle-class in a population of more than one billion people .
lufthansa views the asian sub-continent and 150 million potential customers more and more positively . " it 's an enormous number , " said werner heesen , lufthansa 's director for south asia .
" india 's economic development has caused the buying power to jump incredibly .

however , if the country 's domestic flights are added to the picture , the number leaps to a market of 250 million passengers .
because bargain airlines are starting up constantly , ticket prices are falling . deregulation leads to greater competition the current boom became possible after the indian government loosened its decades-old stranglehold on air travel .
with 20 percent annual growth , the indian market is , in the words of airline expert kapil kaul , " breathtaking compared to the rest of the world . "
he compares the market to a sleeper who suddenly awoke and began to run a marathon . kaul fears thought that the south asian market could become overheated .

there 's also a completely inadequate infrastructure .
above all , india 's metropolitan airports are close to collapse because they are too small . " even major cities like delhi , mumbai and bangalore have only one take-off and landing strip , " said lufthansa 's heesen . air traffic is being slowed by an airport capacity that was built for seven million passengers and not 250 million , creating for lufthansa and other large european carriers the biggest " natural limitation . " modernization in the works still , the ambitious indian government promises improvements .
modernization , less bureaucracy and partial-privatization are supposed to remove the brakes on growth . the government plans to expand the airports in bombay and delhi , the current hubs - and bottlenecks - of air traffic to india .
once those expansions are completed , it 's still unclear when that will be , then carriers will find it easier to bring their passengers to the desired destinations in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baggage workers in india will have more to do in the future " even now when flights are distributed to other cities , the infrastructure can deal with the increasing traffic , " said india 's air traffic minister praful patel . most industry analysts believe the government will succeed in improving conditions .

the market is booming , driven mostly by business travelers and india 's rapidly growing middle-class in a population of more than one billion people .
lufthansa views the asian sub-continent and 150 million potential customers more and more positively . " it 's an enormous number , " said werner heesen , lufthansa 's director for south asia .

however , if the country 's domestic flights are added to the picture , the number leaps to a market of 250 million passengers .
because bargain airlines are starting up constantly , ticket prices are falling . deregulation leads to greater competition the current boom became possible after the indian government loosened its decades-old stranglehold on air travel .
with 20 percent annual growth , the indian market is , in the words of airline expert kapil kaul , " breathtaking compared to the rest of the world . "

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .
despite having taken great strides to improve the chances for asylum-seekers , there is no minimum standard for the living quarters provided by the state for displaced persons . the result is that the vast majority of asylum-seekers are housed in compounds that look like barracks , often surrounded by barbed wire , a virtual internment camp cut off from the german society and without opportunities for integration . the city of münster , in the heart of westphalia in western germany , has taken the initiative to improve the standards for integrating asylum seekers through new concepts in housing .
two housing units have already been built which are located within a neighborhood , easing the opportunities for contact with the locals .
a third one is in the works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living in albachten : better than before the new housing complexes offer immigrants professional and volunteer social workers for advice on everything from legal issues to finding work .
the special care allows immigrants like suljo berisha , who escaped with three generations of his family from war-torn kosovo in the late 1990s , to feel at home in germany for the first time . home sweet albachten until recently berisha lived with his family in a container-style housing project on the edge of town .
now berisha has moved into the new apartments in the south-western suburb of albachten .
the new housing fits in with the surrounding architecture , and offers the look , at least , of integration .
berisha is enthusiastic . " here in albachten things are better , " berisha said .
" we must be thankful for the care received by my children .
the rooms are larger in albachten , too .
everything has gotten better since we moved here . " bildunterschrift : the new apartments are downright cozy the four new single-family row houses offer 50 asylum-seekers a place to call home .
their high quality attracted the attention of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , who praised the münster model .
the city of münster 's department for resettled ethnic germans -lrb- aussiedler -rrb- , refugees and asylum-seekers ' jochen köhnke welcomed the social benefits of the new housing project . " in contrast to the large-scale , institutionalized housing , we notice that the new apartments allow for a sense of civil society to develop , " he said .
" we have volunteers from within the immigrant community supporting the social work of our office , and quite a number of immigrants have been adopted by the local community . " the positive results also carried over to the children of the refugees , he added . " we are seeing promising developments in the schools , too , " köhnke said .
" the children are not just going more regularly to school , they are also able to enter the class appropriate for their age and thrive there .
our office is pleased . " a return to normalcy in the albachten housing units , the immigrants ' children help one another with homework .
the mothers have the opportunity to take german classes while their babies are in day care .
the high demand for german classes encourages volunteer teachers such as gisela wedig to carry on with their work . " we have seen that five days after giving birth , the women come back to our classes .
this inspires us to keep on with it , " wedig said .
" we accompany parents to school open house because the parents often have trouble understanding teachers , and vice versa , " she said . it was not always this way .
the eased integration offered by the volunteer teachers is not merely a service .
strong bonds have been formed and even friendships flourish between the münster natives and the newcomers .
the new housing units together with gradually improving initiatives for social integration are allowing for an improvement in the quality of life enjoyed by the immigrant community . not all peaches and cream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitchens in albachten come fully equipped though the münster model has received accolades from human rights activists , there are naturally detractors of the system as well .
the high quality of the housing and social care offered to refugees in münster cut deeply into the city 's public funds .
after receiving excellent care , learning the german language and starting on the long road to integration , their applications for a residency permit often fail .
some contend that the public investment is therefore an inefficient expenditure . köhnke disagreed : knowledge of german and german culture can never be taken away from the asylum-seekers , he said .
even if their bid for amnesty is not accepted and the families must return to their homeland , the immigrants will have profited from their time in germany . at least for the time being , many residents of the new immigrant housing seem to be content .
living in a neighborly environment fosters neighborly interactions .
suljo berisha is happy with the overall friendliness of his daily interactions . " we never meet a neighbor without saying ' hello ' , or ' good evening ' , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ?

more countries are banning smoking in public places , and tobacco advertising is on the decrease .
the industry is starting to get worried . it seems that everywhere you turn nowadays in europe , smoking is under attack .
norway , italy , ireland and most recently , sweden , have introduced bans on smoking in bars and restaurants .
higher tobacco taxes are leading to declining sales , as are eu-wide limits on tobacco advertising .
leading german politicians and european organizations have now begun campaigning for smoking to be off limits to the expected 3.37 million fans expected to file into world cup stadiums next june for the month-long tournament . and the world 's major tobacco companies seem worried not just about the decline in sales and ads , but in the flourishing black market for tobacco goods streaming in from eastern europe .
in the eastern part of germany , 30 percent of the total number of cigarettes sold are no longer taxed . ad and declining sales more damaging " in frankfurt an der oder , on the polish border , around 80 percent of the cigarettes no longer are taxed , " said lars grosskurth , spokesman for reemtsma , the daughter company of imperial tobacco , the fourth largest tobacco company in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packs of west cigarettes , a reemstma brand , after being seized at the german-polish border the black market puts a dent in sales , but potentially more damaging long term are the measures to stifle cigarette consumption .
packs in all eu countries now carry glaring black headlines warning smokers that nicotine can , among other things , reduce their sex drive , or kill them . such measures are already starting work .
according to the german cancer research institute in cologne , the number of cigarettes smoked dropped from 168 billion in 2002 to 148 billion 2004 , a reduction of 12 percent , the biggest in german history . germans lag behind but the german government itself is not helping much , say anti-tobacco organizations .
the country is one of the few to have not completely complied with the eu directive on tobacco advertising .
the social democrats blame the christian democratic party for blocking legislation in the upper house of parliament , but have also filed suit against the eu directive in the european court of justice saying such a directive is not within the union 's jurisdiction . but the government has signed an agreement with hotel and restaurant organizations that , while not completely banning it , will seek to curb smoking in those places . anti-smoking advocates seem to have increasing support for their work .
a recent survey revealed that 51 percent of germans are against a smoking ban .
in 2003 , it was 62 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes made by the hamburg firm reemstma is it time for tobacco companies to begin looking around for other ideas ?
british american tobacco is already diversified , having invested in paper factories , insurance firms and department stores in the 1960s and 1970s .
but spokesman rainer stubenvoll says his company is not running up the white flag just yet . " we 're a shareholder company , and the shareholder does n't want to see a mix from us , " he said .
" they want to see the clear orientation of bat as a tobacco company .

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .
despite having taken great strides to improve the chances for asylum-seekers , there is no minimum standard for the living quarters provided by the state for displaced persons . the result is that the vast majority of asylum-seekers are housed in compounds that look like barracks , often surrounded by barbed wire , a virtual internment camp cut off from the german society and without opportunities for integration . the city of münster , in the heart of westphalia in western germany , has taken the initiative to improve the standards for integrating asylum seekers through new concepts in housing .
two housing units have already been built which are located within a neighborhood , easing the opportunities for contact with the locals .
a third one is in the works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living in albachten : better than before the new housing complexes offer immigrants professional and volunteer social workers for advice on everything from legal issues to finding work .
the special care allows immigrants like suljo berisha , who escaped with three generations of his family from war-torn kosovo in the late 1990s , to feel at home in germany for the first time . home sweet albachten until recently berisha lived with his family in a container-style housing project on the edge of town .
now berisha has moved into the new apartments in the south-western suburb of albachten .
the new housing fits in with the surrounding architecture , and offers the look , at least , of integration .
berisha is enthusiastic . " here in albachten things are better , " berisha said .
" we must be thankful for the care received by my children .
the rooms are larger in albachten , too .
everything has gotten better since we moved here . " bildunterschrift : the new apartments are downright cozy the four new single-family row houses offer 50 asylum-seekers a place to call home .
their high quality attracted the attention of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , who praised the münster model .
the city of münster 's department for resettled ethnic germans -lrb- aussiedler -rrb- , refugees and asylum-seekers ' jochen köhnke welcomed the social benefits of the new housing project . " in contrast to the large-scale , institutionalized housing , we notice that the new apartments allow for a sense of civil society to develop , " he said .
" we have volunteers from within the immigrant community supporting the social work of our office , and quite a number of immigrants have been adopted by the local community . " the positive results also carried over to the children of the refugees , he added . " we are seeing promising developments in the schools , too , " köhnke said .
" the children are not just going more regularly to school , they are also able to enter the class appropriate for their age and thrive there .
our office is pleased . " a return to normalcy in the albachten housing units , the immigrants ' children help one another with homework .
the mothers have the opportunity to take german classes while their babies are in day care .
the high demand for german classes encourages volunteer teachers such as gisela wedig to carry on with their work . " we have seen that five days after giving birth , the women come back to our classes .
this inspires us to keep on with it , " wedig said .
" we accompany parents to school open house because the parents often have trouble understanding teachers , and vice versa , " she said . it was not always this way .
the eased integration offered by the volunteer teachers is not merely a service .
strong bonds have been formed and even friendships flourish between the münster natives and the newcomers .
the new housing units together with gradually improving initiatives for social integration are allowing for an improvement in the quality of life enjoyed by the immigrant community . not all peaches and cream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitchens in albachten come fully equipped though the münster model has received accolades from human rights activists , there are naturally detractors of the system as well .
the high quality of the housing and social care offered to refugees in münster cut deeply into the city 's public funds .
after receiving excellent care , learning the german language and starting on the long road to integration , their applications for a residency permit often fail .
some contend that the public investment is therefore an inefficient expenditure . köhnke disagreed : knowledge of german and german culture can never be taken away from the asylum-seekers , he said .
even if their bid for amnesty is not accepted and the families must return to their homeland , the immigrants will have profited from their time in germany . at least for the time being , many residents of the new immigrant housing seem to be content .
living in a neighborly environment fosters neighborly interactions .
suljo berisha is happy with the overall friendliness of his daily interactions . " we never meet a neighbor without saying ' hello ' , or ' good evening ' , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ?

the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication . as expected , germany 's greens elected the left-leaning consumer affairs minister and one of the party 's chief strategists to lead the parliamentary faction of the party as it prepares to enter the opposition after seven years in government .

kuhn , a party veteran who briefly chaired the party with künast in 2000 , is known as one of the party 's power players and a close confidante of foreign minister joschka fischer . " they represent the entire spectrum that they need to reach out to , " said party researcher oskar niedermayer .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .
in the past years , there have been several attempts to tame the bureaucratic monster that consists of around 80,000 pages of legislation .
and eu citizens can do their bit to help too .

more countries are banning smoking in public places , and tobacco advertising is on the decrease .
the industry is starting to get worried . it seems that everywhere you turn nowadays in europe , smoking is under attack .
norway , italy , ireland and most recently , sweden , have introduced bans on smoking in bars and restaurants .
higher tobacco taxes are leading to declining sales , as are eu-wide limits on tobacco advertising .
leading german politicians and european organizations have now begun campaigning for smoking to be off limits to the expected 3.37 million fans expected to file into world cup stadiums next june for the month-long tournament . and the world 's major tobacco companies seem worried not just about the decline in sales and ads , but in the flourishing black market for tobacco goods streaming in from eastern europe .
in the eastern part of germany , 30 percent of the total number of cigarettes sold are no longer taxed . ad and declining sales more damaging " in frankfurt an der oder , on the polish border , around 80 percent of the cigarettes no longer are taxed , " said lars grosskurth , spokesman for reemtsma , the daughter company of imperial tobacco , the fourth largest tobacco company in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packs of west cigarettes , a reemstma brand , after being seized at the german-polish border the black market puts a dent in sales , but potentially more damaging long term are the measures to stifle cigarette consumption .
packs in all eu countries now carry glaring black headlines warning smokers that nicotine can , among other things , reduce their sex drive , or kill them . such measures are already starting work .
according to the german cancer research institute in cologne , the number of cigarettes smoked dropped from 168 billion in 2002 to 148 billion 2004 , a reduction of 12 percent , the biggest in german history . germans lag behind but the german government itself is not helping much , say anti-tobacco organizations .
the country is one of the few to have not completely complied with the eu directive on tobacco advertising .
the social democrats blame the christian democratic party for blocking legislation in the upper house of parliament , but have also filed suit against the eu directive in the european court of justice saying such a directive is not within the union 's jurisdiction . but the government has signed an agreement with hotel and restaurant organizations that , while not completely banning it , will seek to curb smoking in those places . anti-smoking advocates seem to have increasing support for their work .
a recent survey revealed that 51 percent of germans are against a smoking ban .
in 2003 , it was 62 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes made by the hamburg firm reemstma is it time for tobacco companies to begin looking around for other ideas ?
british american tobacco is already diversified , having invested in paper factories , insurance firms and department stores in the 1960s and 1970s .
but spokesman rainer stubenvoll says his company is not running up the white flag just yet . " we 're a shareholder company , and the shareholder does n't want to see a mix from us , " he said .

not yet consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal . one day before a new round of top-level exploratory talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's conservative christian union alliance on forming a governing coalition , leading figures in the two blocs said they were finding common ground . bavarian premier edmund stoiber , one of germany 's most powerful conservative regional leaders , offered a vote of confidence in a grand coalition by saying he hoped to join such a government as a cabinet member . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel " first the union and the spd must agree on a stable government with a reasonable program , " stoiber told the mass-selling bild newspaper .
" then i could imagine assuming responsibility in such a cabinet . " economy minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats told ard public television that his party would work with the conservatives on outlining fiscal and labor market policies to tackle the mounting public debt and 11.4-percent jobless rate . he said those problems took priority over the " personnel " issue - who would win the chancellery . cdu insists on merkel the sept .
18 election left germany at a political impasse after voters failed to give either of the main blocs a ruling majority . the christian union won a three-seat lead over the social democrats but the narrow result left both merkel and schröder claiming a mandate to be germany 's next leader . merkel said monday that the social democrats would have to accept the christian union 's right to choose the chancellor before coalition negotiations could begin . spd leaders continued to resist , saying that they would enter the talks with the aim of seeing schroeder confirmed for a third term . will schröder budge ? but some social democrats cautiously hinted that schröder could bow out in the interest of an agreement with the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler " if he -lrb- schröder -rrb- for some reason said , ' i agree with what is coming together and perhaps someone needs to budge on the personnel issue ' , then we would accept that , " the deputy head of the spd parliamentary group , gernot erler , told ard . analysts predicted the first real movement on the tentative negotiations next week , after a district in the eastern city of dresden casts its ballots in the general election .
the poll was postponed for two weeks because of the death of a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will schröder go ?
will he do so voluntarily ?
schröder 's strategy of clinging to power was seen largely as a bluff aimed at strengthening his party 's position ahead of what is sure to be intense horse-trading . " a few days after the election in dresden , schröder can say , ' in the interest of the country , in the interest of the common good , i 'll clear the way for merkel ' , " political scientist peter lösche of the university of göttingen told rolling news channel n24 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder sticks to leadership claim chancellor schröder on sunday resisted mounting pressure to step aside to break the political deadlock gripping germany following an inconclusive general election one week ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.09.2005 eu tackles its own bureaucracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking to save some trees in a concerted drive to slash excessive red tape , the eu commission on tuesday abolished 68 rules the body believes are not only superfluous , but also harmful to the eu . the harmonization of sunday driving bans , flight attendent qualifications and the packing of coffee are only three of the almost 68 proposed regulations the eu commission views as senseless and detrimental to member states .
on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .
despite having taken great strides to improve the chances for asylum-seekers , there is no minimum standard for the living quarters provided by the state for displaced persons . the result is that the vast majority of asylum-seekers are housed in compounds that look like barracks , often surrounded by barbed wire , a virtual internment camp cut off from the german society and without opportunities for integration . the city of münster , in the heart of westphalia in western germany , has taken the initiative to improve the standards for integrating asylum seekers through new concepts in housing .
two housing units have already been built which are located within a neighborhood , easing the opportunities for contact with the locals .
a third one is in the works . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : living in albachten : better than before the new housing complexes offer immigrants professional and volunteer social workers for advice on everything from legal issues to finding work .
the special care allows immigrants like suljo berisha , who escaped with three generations of his family from war-torn kosovo in the late 1990s , to feel at home in germany for the first time . home sweet albachten until recently berisha lived with his family in a container-style housing project on the edge of town .
now berisha has moved into the new apartments in the south-western suburb of albachten .
the new housing fits in with the surrounding architecture , and offers the look , at least , of integration .
berisha is enthusiastic . " here in albachten things are better , " berisha said .
" we must be thankful for the care received by my children .
the rooms are larger in albachten , too .
everything has gotten better since we moved here . " bildunterschrift : the new apartments are downright cozy the four new single-family row houses offer 50 asylum-seekers a place to call home .
their high quality attracted the attention of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , who praised the münster model .
the city of münster 's department for resettled ethnic germans -lrb- aussiedler -rrb- , refugees and asylum-seekers ' jochen köhnke welcomed the social benefits of the new housing project . " in contrast to the large-scale , institutionalized housing , we notice that the new apartments allow for a sense of civil society to develop , " he said .
" we have volunteers from within the immigrant community supporting the social work of our office , and quite a number of immigrants have been adopted by the local community . " the positive results also carried over to the children of the refugees , he added . " we are seeing promising developments in the schools , too , " köhnke said .
" the children are not just going more regularly to school , they are also able to enter the class appropriate for their age and thrive there .
our office is pleased . " a return to normalcy in the albachten housing units , the immigrants ' children help one another with homework .
the mothers have the opportunity to take german classes while their babies are in day care .
the high demand for german classes encourages volunteer teachers such as gisela wedig to carry on with their work . " we have seen that five days after giving birth , the women come back to our classes .
this inspires us to keep on with it , " wedig said .
" we accompany parents to school open house because the parents often have trouble understanding teachers , and vice versa , " she said . it was not always this way .
the eased integration offered by the volunteer teachers is not merely a service .
strong bonds have been formed and even friendships flourish between the münster natives and the newcomers .
the new housing units together with gradually improving initiatives for social integration are allowing for an improvement in the quality of life enjoyed by the immigrant community . not all peaches and cream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kitchens in albachten come fully equipped though the münster model has received accolades from human rights activists , there are naturally detractors of the system as well .
the high quality of the housing and social care offered to refugees in münster cut deeply into the city 's public funds .
after receiving excellent care , learning the german language and starting on the long road to integration , their applications for a residency permit often fail .
some contend that the public investment is therefore an inefficient expenditure . köhnke disagreed : knowledge of german and german culture can never be taken away from the asylum-seekers , he said .
even if their bid for amnesty is not accepted and the families must return to their homeland , the immigrants will have profited from their time in germany . at least for the time being , many residents of the new immigrant housing seem to be content .
living in a neighborly environment fosters neighborly interactions .
suljo berisha is happy with the overall friendliness of his daily interactions . " we never meet a neighbor without saying ' hello ' , or ' good evening ' , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are asylum seekers getting a fair shot ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.09.2005 eu tackles its own bureaucracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is looking to save some trees in a concerted drive to slash excessive red tape , the eu commission on tuesday abolished 68 rules the body believes are not only superfluous , but also harmful to the eu . the harmonization of sunday driving bans , flight attendent qualifications and the packing of coffee are only three of the almost 68 proposed regulations the eu commission views as senseless and detrimental to member states .
on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .

the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication . as expected , germany 's greens elected the left-leaning consumer affairs minister and one of the party 's chief strategists to lead the parliamentary faction of the party as it prepares to enter the opposition after seven years in government .

kuhn , a party veteran who briefly chaired the party with künast in 2000 , is known as one of the party 's power players and a close confidante of foreign minister joschka fischer . " they represent the entire spectrum that they need to reach out to , " said party researcher oskar niedermayer .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .
in the past years , there have been several attempts to tame the bureaucratic monster that consists of around 80,000 pages of legislation .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .
in the past years , there have been several attempts to tame the bureaucratic monster that consists of around 80,000 pages of legislation .
and eu citizens can do their bit to help too .
they can send recommendations to their representatives in brussels about where they can cut cumbersome rules . bernd riegert -lrb- jb / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu data-storage plan worries critics in a bid to more easily track criminals , the eu is proposing a unified plan to save telecommunications data across europe .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .
18 .
the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .
der bundestag berät unter anderem über verschiedene arbeitsmarktreformen .
weitere tagesordnungspunkte der sitzung sind ein schärferes vorgehen gegen graffiti-sprayer und das umstrittene antidiskriminierungsgesetz .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .
many of dresden 's residents think that chancellor schröder and the social democrats are poor losers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " and what happens to me ? " reads the mock poster by the youth group of bavaria 's christian social union " well , we do n't have to do much at all right now , " lämmel said .
" schröder 's appearance on the night of the election , and the activities of the spd since then mean that i 'm having no problems with convincing people germany needs the cdu . " in a televised appearance on the night of the german election , schröder pushed forward his claim to chancellorship in a way which many observers found to be too belligerent .
but the social democrats are not the only rival that the cdu is facing .
the successors to the former communist party , the left party - formerly known as pds - is running neck and neck with the cdu .
in the bundestag elections , they won the vote of almost a quarter of electors in eastern germany . feeling important in dresden , residents are aware of how the rest of the country voted , and now the whole of germany wants to know how they will vote . " i think it 's great , " one voter said .
" i 've already sent off my postal vote and this time my choice was different from what i 'd originally planned .
it was more a case of seeing how everyone else voted and then deciding what to do . " bildunterschrift : one of them is bound to smile sunday night the coming weekend in dresden is bound to be filled with excitement .
although nobody - not even thomas gottschalk - will dare to bet on the outcome . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu , spd search for common ground consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .

the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .

the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .

both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .
many of dresden 's residents think that chancellor schröder and the social democrats are poor losers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " and what happens to me ? " reads the mock poster by the youth group of bavaria 's christian social union " well , we do n't have to do much at all right now , " lämmel said .
" schröder 's appearance on the night of the election , and the activities of the spd since then mean that i 'm having no problems with convincing people germany needs the cdu . " in a televised appearance on the night of the german election , schröder pushed forward his claim to chancellorship in a way which many observers found to be too belligerent .
but the social democrats are not the only rival that the cdu is facing .
the successors to the former communist party , the left party - formerly known as pds - is running neck and neck with the cdu .
in the bundestag elections , they won the vote of almost a quarter of electors in eastern germany . feeling important in dresden , residents are aware of how the rest of the country voted , and now the whole of germany wants to know how they will vote . " i think it 's great , " one voter said .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .
18 .
the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .
der bundestag berät unter anderem über verschiedene arbeitsmarktreformen .

ratzinger was at that time a member of the ministry , becoming its head two years later .
the swiss theologian had been accused of having " strayed from the truth of the catholic faith . " a supporter of dialogue between religion and science and of a greater role for women within the church , küng was particularly critical of pope jean paul ii 's pontificate , which he accused in 2003 of having " killed all life in the church . " although the pair had fallen out , the dissident theologian said he saw some " signs of hope " in ratzinger 's election as pope . the dawn of a new era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the vatican becoming more liberal ?
this is not the first controversial move of the new pope .
in august , benedict xvi met with bishop bernard fellay , leader of the catholic ultraconservative brotherhood established in 1969 by the french-born archbishop marcel lefebvre , who was excommunicated in 1976 for opposing the reforms of the second vatican council . the italian press has reacted positively to benedict xvi willingness to talk to his doctrinal opponents .
la stampa wrote on tuesday that the " pope wants not only to abate , but perhaps even end the conflict with the catholic right and catholic left .
this is not about ignoring differences , but rather about building bridges toward a new dialogue . " even though the talks with the pope did not produce any dramatic results , küng said on monday that the meeting was a sign " that this pope does not look towards the past and does not withdraw from the world .

not yet consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal . one day before a new round of top-level exploratory talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's conservative christian union alliance on forming a governing coalition , leading figures in the two blocs said they were finding common ground . bavarian premier edmund stoiber , one of germany 's most powerful conservative regional leaders , offered a vote of confidence in a grand coalition by saying he hoped to join such a government as a cabinet member . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel " first the union and the spd must agree on a stable government with a reasonable program , " stoiber told the mass-selling bild newspaper .
" then i could imagine assuming responsibility in such a cabinet . " economy minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats told ard public television that his party would work with the conservatives on outlining fiscal and labor market policies to tackle the mounting public debt and 11.4-percent jobless rate . he said those problems took priority over the " personnel " issue - who would win the chancellery . cdu insists on merkel the sept .
18 election left germany at a political impasse after voters failed to give either of the main blocs a ruling majority . the christian union won a three-seat lead over the social democrats but the narrow result left both merkel and schröder claiming a mandate to be germany 's next leader . merkel said monday that the social democrats would have to accept the christian union 's right to choose the chancellor before coalition negotiations could begin . spd leaders continued to resist , saying that they would enter the talks with the aim of seeing schroeder confirmed for a third term . will schröder budge ? but some social democrats cautiously hinted that schröder could bow out in the interest of an agreement with the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler " if he -lrb- schröder -rrb- for some reason said , ' i agree with what is coming together and perhaps someone needs to budge on the personnel issue ' , then we would accept that , " the deputy head of the spd parliamentary group , gernot erler , told ard . analysts predicted the first real movement on the tentative negotiations next week , after a district in the eastern city of dresden casts its ballots in the general election .
the poll was postponed for two weeks because of the death of a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will schröder go ?
will he do so voluntarily ?
schröder 's strategy of clinging to power was seen largely as a bluff aimed at strengthening his party 's position ahead of what is sure to be intense horse-trading . " a few days after the election in dresden , schröder can say , ' in the interest of the country , in the interest of the common good , i 'll clear the way for merkel ' , " political scientist peter lösche of the university of göttingen told rolling news channel n24 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder sticks to leadership claim chancellor schröder on sunday resisted mounting pressure to step aside to break the political deadlock gripping germany following an inconclusive general election one week ago .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .

the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .

" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .
in the past years , there have been several attempts to tame the bureaucratic monster that consists of around 80,000 pages of legislation .
and eu citizens can do their bit to help too .
they can send recommendations to their representatives in brussels about where they can cut cumbersome rules . bernd riegert -lrb- jb / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu data-storage plan worries critics in a bid to more easily track criminals , the eu is proposing a unified plan to save telecommunications data across europe .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .

more countries are banning smoking in public places , and tobacco advertising is on the decrease .
the industry is starting to get worried . it seems that everywhere you turn nowadays in europe , smoking is under attack .
norway , italy , ireland and most recently , sweden , have introduced bans on smoking in bars and restaurants .
higher tobacco taxes are leading to declining sales , as are eu-wide limits on tobacco advertising .
leading german politicians and european organizations have now begun campaigning for smoking to be off limits to the expected 3.37 million fans expected to file into world cup stadiums next june for the month-long tournament . and the world 's major tobacco companies seem worried not just about the decline in sales and ads , but in the flourishing black market for tobacco goods streaming in from eastern europe .
in the eastern part of germany , 30 percent of the total number of cigarettes sold are no longer taxed . ad and declining sales more damaging " in frankfurt an der oder , on the polish border , around 80 percent of the cigarettes no longer are taxed , " said lars grosskurth , spokesman for reemtsma , the daughter company of imperial tobacco , the fourth largest tobacco company in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : packs of west cigarettes , a reemstma brand , after being seized at the german-polish border the black market puts a dent in sales , but potentially more damaging long term are the measures to stifle cigarette consumption .
packs in all eu countries now carry glaring black headlines warning smokers that nicotine can , among other things , reduce their sex drive , or kill them . such measures are already starting work .
according to the german cancer research institute in cologne , the number of cigarettes smoked dropped from 168 billion in 2002 to 148 billion 2004 , a reduction of 12 percent , the biggest in german history . germans lag behind but the german government itself is not helping much , say anti-tobacco organizations .
the country is one of the few to have not completely complied with the eu directive on tobacco advertising .
the social democrats blame the christian democratic party for blocking legislation in the upper house of parliament , but have also filed suit against the eu directive in the european court of justice saying such a directive is not within the union 's jurisdiction . but the government has signed an agreement with hotel and restaurant organizations that , while not completely banning it , will seek to curb smoking in those places . anti-smoking advocates seem to have increasing support for their work .
a recent survey revealed that 51 percent of germans are against a smoking ban .
in 2003 , it was 62 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cigarettes made by the hamburg firm reemstma is it time for tobacco companies to begin looking around for other ideas ?
british american tobacco is already diversified , having invested in paper factories , insurance firms and department stores in the 1960s and 1970s .
but spokesman rainer stubenvoll says his company is not running up the white flag just yet . " we 're a shareholder company , and the shareholder does n't want to see a mix from us , " he said .
" they want to see the clear orientation of bat as a tobacco company .

not yet consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal . one day before a new round of top-level exploratory talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's conservative christian union alliance on forming a governing coalition , leading figures in the two blocs said they were finding common ground . bavarian premier edmund stoiber , one of germany 's most powerful conservative regional leaders , offered a vote of confidence in a grand coalition by saying he hoped to join such a government as a cabinet member . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel " first the union and the spd must agree on a stable government with a reasonable program , " stoiber told the mass-selling bild newspaper .
" then i could imagine assuming responsibility in such a cabinet . " economy minister wolfgang clement of the social democrats told ard public television that his party would work with the conservatives on outlining fiscal and labor market policies to tackle the mounting public debt and 11.4-percent jobless rate . he said those problems took priority over the " personnel " issue - who would win the chancellery . cdu insists on merkel the sept .
18 election left germany at a political impasse after voters failed to give either of the main blocs a ruling majority . the christian union won a three-seat lead over the social democrats but the narrow result left both merkel and schröder claiming a mandate to be germany 's next leader . merkel said monday that the social democrats would have to accept the christian union 's right to choose the chancellor before coalition negotiations could begin . spd leaders continued to resist , saying that they would enter the talks with the aim of seeing schroeder confirmed for a third term . will schröder budge ? but some social democrats cautiously hinted that schröder could bow out in the interest of an agreement with the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler " if he -lrb- schröder -rrb- for some reason said , ' i agree with what is coming together and perhaps someone needs to budge on the personnel issue ' , then we would accept that , " the deputy head of the spd parliamentary group , gernot erler , told ard . analysts predicted the first real movement on the tentative negotiations next week , after a district in the eastern city of dresden casts its ballots in the general election .

not yet consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal . one day before a new round of top-level exploratory talks between chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and angela merkel 's conservative christian union alliance on forming a governing coalition , leading figures in the two blocs said they were finding common ground . bavarian premier edmund stoiber , one of germany 's most powerful conservative regional leaders , offered a vote of confidence in a grand coalition by saying he hoped to join such a government as a cabinet member . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel " first the union and the spd must agree on a stable government with a reasonable program , " stoiber told the mass-selling bild newspaper .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .
in the past years , there have been several attempts to tame the bureaucratic monster that consists of around 80,000 pages of legislation .
and eu citizens can do their bit to help too .
they can send recommendations to their representatives in brussels about where they can cut cumbersome rules . bernd riegert -lrb- jb / dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu data-storage plan worries critics in a bid to more easily track criminals , the eu is proposing a unified plan to save telecommunications data across europe .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .

ratzinger was at that time a member of the ministry , becoming its head two years later .
the swiss theologian had been accused of having " strayed from the truth of the catholic faith . " a supporter of dialogue between religion and science and of a greater role for women within the church , küng was particularly critical of pope jean paul ii 's pontificate , which he accused in 2003 of having " killed all life in the church . " although the pair had fallen out , the dissident theologian said he saw some " signs of hope " in ratzinger 's election as pope . the dawn of a new era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the vatican becoming more liberal ?
this is not the first controversial move of the new pope .
in august , benedict xvi met with bishop bernard fellay , leader of the catholic ultraconservative brotherhood established in 1969 by the french-born archbishop marcel lefebvre , who was excommunicated in 1976 for opposing the reforms of the second vatican council . the italian press has reacted positively to benedict xvi willingness to talk to his doctrinal opponents .
la stampa wrote on tuesday that the " pope wants not only to abate , but perhaps even end the conflict with the catholic right and catholic left .
this is not about ignoring differences , but rather about building bridges toward a new dialogue . " even though the talks with the pope did not produce any dramatic results , küng said on monday that the meeting was a sign " that this pope does not look towards the past and does not withdraw from the world .

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .

a western german town has come up with a new concept for housing refugees . germany 's treatment of its immigrants has long been a subject of acute controversy .
despite having taken great strides to improve the chances for asylum-seekers , there is no minimum standard for the living quarters provided by the state for displaced persons . the result is that the vast majority of asylum-seekers are housed in compounds that look like barracks , often surrounded by barbed wire , a virtual internment camp cut off from the german society and without opportunities for integration . the city of münster , in the heart of westphalia in western germany , has taken the initiative to improve the standards for integrating asylum seekers through new concepts in housing .

some contend that the public investment is therefore an inefficient expenditure . köhnke disagreed : knowledge of german and german culture can never be taken away from the asylum-seekers , he said .

on tuesday , the commission pulled the laws and proposed bills - all of which had been on ice for several years because of disagreement by various member states - from the negotiating table .
" we want to fight bureaucracy and over-regulation on all fronts , " said eu commission president jose manuel barroso in announcing the move .
in march , eu industry commissioner günther verheugen , announced the rehauling of the eu 's excessive bureacracy and drew up a blacklist of rules that he said should be consigned to the rubbish bin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter verheugen " we know that eu citizens look at brussels as a bureaucratic monster , " said verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , who 's taken on the role of dragon slayer and plans to cut the superfluous bits .
" i 'm going to make it my personal quest , " verheugen said .
" and after five years , one will be able to say that it was the commission that truly managed to do it . "
business not impressed the blacklist contained , among other things , a " guideline for the harmonization of rules about limiting cross-border goods transfer . "
the eu wanted to abolish sunday driving bans for trucks with the help of the regulation .
business interest groups appeared unimpressed by the commission 's steps .
" this list of laws for withdrawal must not be regarded as a panacea for the better regulation agenda .
for one thing it is fairly limited - most of the texts mentioned are anachronisms that would have been shelved anyway , " hans-werner müller , secretary general of ueapme , representing small firms told the eu observer .
the need for more accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : off the table is a law that harmonizes sunday driving bans a recent study by the british government showed that improving the consultation process before approving new legislation would help keep needless bureaucracy out and make the eu more accountable to its citizens .
britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency , established the better regulation task force as part of the push for better regulations in the eu .
the study also emphasized that the impact of rules needs to be assessed .
regulation is estimated to cost 10 to 12 percent of gross domestic product , with about a third of this due to unnecessary bureaucracy , officials said .
needlessly burdening businesses even verheugen , the self-appointed crusader against eu bureacracy , said that eu officials often ended up needlessly burdening businesses .
" the businesses that need to fill in a two-page form in order to participate in a european contract , first need a 200-page manual to read how to correctly fill out the form , " verheugen said .
he added that it was completely incomprehensible for a politician and showed that one needed to carefully examine the bureacratic maze generated by the political side itself .
" it shows me that we have to better assess the impact of legislation on business , " verheugen added .
to make matters worse , the affected commissions are resisting the attempt to throw out several of the rules pertaining to their areas .
of the 900 laws currently in the works in the eu , not even 10 percent of them will be dropped - a fact that 's bemoaned as ' too little ' by some in brussels .
eu citizens called on for suggestions the new drive to cut red tape in the eu is n't the first .
in the past years , there have been several attempts to tame the bureaucratic monster that consists of around 80,000 pages of legislation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.09.2005 germany 's greens prepare for new role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for the right direction under new leadership after seven , sometimes turbulent , years in government , what 's next for the world 's most successful green party ?
the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication . as expected , germany 's greens elected the left-leaning consumer affairs minister and one of the party 's chief strategists to lead the parliamentary faction of the party as it prepares to enter the opposition after seven years in government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuhn -lrb- l . -rrb- and künast are the new leaders the selection of minister renate künast , who immediately resigned her office upon being elected tuesday afternoon , and fritz kuhn indicates an effort by the party to reach out to its various voter blocs .
künast is traditionally an acolyte of the leftist , ecological wing of the party .
kuhn , a party veteran who briefly chaired the party with künast in 2000 , is known as one of the party 's power players and a close confidante of foreign minister joschka fischer . " they represent the entire spectrum that they need to reach out to , " said party researcher oskar niedermayer .
" it 's a man and woman combination , and they represent the left and the middle . " step in the opposition at a time when the greens are casting about for solid ground , the selection of the two suggests a continuance of the power politics foisted on the party by fischer , who announced last week that he would not lead the party in the parliamentary opposition . after seven years helping chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats rule the country , the greens face a different future after germans voted out the coalition government on sept .
18 .
the party did n't help its own cause , dropping three seats in the bundestag , pushing them behind the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party as the parliament 's fifth-strongest party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called jamaica coalition , with the conservative union parties and the fdp is likely out of the question though some factions of the party continue to flirt with the conservative christian democratic union and the fdp in hopes of forming a three-party ruling coalition , most of the greens have begun to steel themselves for a return to the opposition role they held for decades . " it is time for us greens to take a new step , one into the opposition , " said künast , after her election . fischer 's paint bomb attack born out of a mix of anti-war and ecological movements in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the greens gave voice to a swath of germans who felt unrepresented by the unionist social democrats and the conservative christian democratic union in the 1980s .
but after entering the government coalition in 1998 , they were almost immediately forced to make compromises considered by many to be impossible .
over the complaints of many party veterans , fischer , who had emerged as the green 's strong man after becoming the first green minister , -lrb- taking over the environmental post in hesse in 1984 -rrb- , wrangled the party leadership and pacifist base into approving the deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in kosovo and macedonia in 1999 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , after the paint attack on the green party special congress on the kosovo war he did n't come away untouched .
a disgruntled party member pelted fischer with a red paint bomb at a party event , damaging his ear drum , but not his resolve to keep his greens in power .
father figure gone the greens survived the members that chose to leave the party at that point , and proved capable in the new power player role .
they pushed german utilities into agreeing to a gradual phase-out of nuclear energy in the next 20 years , in favor of alternative energy sources .
it was the greens ' resolve that got a same-sex marriage bill made into law . but the greens also lost regional and state elections , and , when they were voted out along with the spd in this may 's elections in north rhine-westphalia , it left germany without an spd-green coalition in any of its 16 states .
last wednesday , fischer placed a further burden on the party when he chose to fade into the back rows of parliament . " it 's … difficult for the outward appearance of the party , because fischer dominated that , " said niedermayer , a professor at the freie university in berlin .
" they need to now replace this father figure , with a collective of parents , and that will be difficult . " focus on the economy the burden rests on künast and kuhn 's shoulders .
the pair have already identified the first priority : figuring out where the greens stand on reforming germany .
in brief remarks after his election , kuhn , the party 's economic and tax expert , said the greens would work for more economic efficiency , jobs and social justice in the reforms . niedermayer added that the party should also think about shoring up its power base as germany ages by tweaking the party platform to attract older voters . " the greens wo n't have a problem as long as they slowly start to think about reaching out not to the younger , but the older generations , " said niedermayer . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica in germany ?
the jamaican coalition was n't seriously discussed until election night , when a television anchor introduced the term .

the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication . as expected , germany 's greens elected the left-leaning consumer affairs minister and one of the party 's chief strategists to lead the parliamentary faction of the party as it prepares to enter the opposition after seven years in government .

künast is traditionally an acolyte of the leftist , ecological wing of the party .
kuhn , a party veteran who briefly chaired the party with künast in 2000 , is known as one of the party 's power players and a close confidante of foreign minister joschka fischer . " they represent the entire spectrum that they need to reach out to , " said party researcher oskar niedermayer .

" they need to now replace this father figure , with a collective of parents , and that will be difficult . " focus on the economy the burden rests on künast and kuhn 's shoulders .
the pair have already identified the first priority : figuring out where the greens stand on reforming germany .
in brief remarks after his election , kuhn , the party 's economic and tax expert , said the greens would work for more economic efficiency , jobs and social justice in the reforms . niedermayer added that the party should also think about shoring up its power base as germany ages by tweaking the party platform to attract older voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.09.2005 germany 's greens prepare for new role großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for the right direction under new leadership after seven , sometimes turbulent , years in government , what 's next for the world 's most successful green party ?
the selection of new parliamentary leaders on tuesday may have given some indication . as expected , germany 's greens elected the left-leaning consumer affairs minister and one of the party 's chief strategists to lead the parliamentary faction of the party as it prepares to enter the opposition after seven years in government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuhn -lrb- l . -rrb- and künast are the new leaders the selection of minister renate künast , who immediately resigned her office upon being elected tuesday afternoon , and fritz kuhn indicates an effort by the party to reach out to its various voter blocs .
künast is traditionally an acolyte of the leftist , ecological wing of the party .
kuhn , a party veteran who briefly chaired the party with künast in 2000 , is known as one of the party 's power players and a close confidante of foreign minister joschka fischer . " they represent the entire spectrum that they need to reach out to , " said party researcher oskar niedermayer .
" it 's a man and woman combination , and they represent the left and the middle . " step in the opposition at a time when the greens are casting about for solid ground , the selection of the two suggests a continuance of the power politics foisted on the party by fischer , who announced last week that he would not lead the party in the parliamentary opposition . after seven years helping chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats rule the country , the greens face a different future after germans voted out the coalition government on sept .
18 .
the party did n't help its own cause , dropping three seats in the bundestag , pushing them behind the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the left party as the parliament 's fifth-strongest party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a so-called jamaica coalition , with the conservative union parties and the fdp is likely out of the question though some factions of the party continue to flirt with the conservative christian democratic union and the fdp in hopes of forming a three-party ruling coalition , most of the greens have begun to steel themselves for a return to the opposition role they held for decades . " it is time for us greens to take a new step , one into the opposition , " said künast , after her election . fischer 's paint bomb attack born out of a mix of anti-war and ecological movements in the late 1970s and early 1980s , the greens gave voice to a swath of germans who felt unrepresented by the unionist social democrats and the conservative christian democratic union in the 1980s .
but after entering the government coalition in 1998 , they were almost immediately forced to make compromises considered by many to be impossible .
over the complaints of many party veterans , fischer , who had emerged as the green 's strong man after becoming the first green minister , -lrb- taking over the environmental post in hesse in 1984 -rrb- , wrangled the party leadership and pacifist base into approving the deployment of bundeswehr soldiers in kosovo and macedonia in 1999 and 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , after the paint attack on the green party special congress on the kosovo war he did n't come away untouched .
a disgruntled party member pelted fischer with a red paint bomb at a party event , damaging his ear drum , but not his resolve to keep his greens in power .
father figure gone the greens survived the members that chose to leave the party at that point , and proved capable in the new power player role .
they pushed german utilities into agreeing to a gradual phase-out of nuclear energy in the next 20 years , in favor of alternative energy sources .
it was the greens ' resolve that got a same-sex marriage bill made into law . but the greens also lost regional and state elections , and , when they were voted out along with the spd in this may 's elections in north rhine-westphalia , it left germany without an spd-green coalition in any of its 16 states .
last wednesday , fischer placed a further burden on the party when he chose to fade into the back rows of parliament . " it 's … difficult for the outward appearance of the party , because fischer dominated that , " said niedermayer , a professor at the freie university in berlin .
" they need to now replace this father figure , with a collective of parents , and that will be difficult . " focus on the economy the burden rests on künast and kuhn 's shoulders .
the pair have already identified the first priority : figuring out where the greens stand on reforming germany .
in brief remarks after his election , kuhn , the party 's economic and tax expert , said the greens would work for more economic efficiency , jobs and social justice in the reforms . niedermayer added that the party should also think about shoring up its power base as germany ages by tweaking the party platform to attract older voters . " the greens wo n't have a problem as long as they slowly start to think about reaching out not to the younger , but the older generations , " said niedermayer . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jamaica in germany ?

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .
18 .
the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .
many of dresden 's residents think that chancellor schröder and the social democrats are poor losers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " and what happens to me ? " reads the mock poster by the youth group of bavaria 's christian social union " well , we do n't have to do much at all right now , " lämmel said .
" schröder 's appearance on the night of the election , and the activities of the spd since then mean that i 'm having no problems with convincing people germany needs the cdu . " in a televised appearance on the night of the german election , schröder pushed forward his claim to chancellorship in a way which many observers found to be too belligerent .
but the social democrats are not the only rival that the cdu is facing .
the successors to the former communist party , the left party - formerly known as pds - is running neck and neck with the cdu .
in the bundestag elections , they won the vote of almost a quarter of electors in eastern germany . feeling important in dresden , residents are aware of how the rest of the country voted , and now the whole of germany wants to know how they will vote . " i think it 's great , " one voter said .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .

the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .

on that saturday night , the first episode of a new season of " wetten dass … , " europe 's most successful tv show , will be broadcast live from the eastern german city that once helped bring down the east german communist regime with massive demonstrations in 1989 .
the show in which celebrities place bets on different contestants and their quirky stunts is moderated by thomas gottschalk , germany 's most famous show-master .
his guests will include the pop bands simply red and backstreet boys , the royal philharmonic orchestra , german actress heike matkatsch and soccer player lukas podolski . it will be entertainment , as usual . on the following morning , however , voters will hit the polls in one of the dresden districts to cast their general election ballots , two weeks after the rest of germany voted on sept .
18 .
the election in dresden was delayed after the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the electoral campaign .
up to three parliamentary seats are at stake but the result is expected to leave the conservative christian union 's slim lead in place . first postponed , then cancelled ? the extraordinary election has already led to some confusion : the city of dresden announced on monday that official-looking , but falsified letters , bearing the signature of the local election district manager , have been circulating around the city , mis-informing the electorate that the voting in the district 160 , scheduled for sunday , has been cancelled .
the district election manager detlef sittel said that the incident is under investigation and that charges would be pressed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein schwach besetzter plenarsaal und eine leere regierungsbank am freitag -lrb- 17.06.2005 -rrb- im deutschen bundestag in berlin .
der bundestag berät unter anderem über verschiedene arbeitsmarktreformen .
weitere tagesordnungspunkte der sitzung sind ein schärferes vorgehen gegen graffiti-sprayer und das umstrittene antidiskriminierungsgesetz .

the slight advantage that the conservatives currently hold may diminish , however , which could further complicate the negotiations and strengthen chancellor schröder 's claim to power . it 's show-time , again ! over the next couple of day , a number of german politicians will travel to dresden to campaign for the 219,000 votes that are left for grabs .
both merkel and schröder will make their appearances at party rallies on friday . peggy bellmann , the candidate for the free-market liberal fdp party , has no chance of making it into the bundestag , but she 'll still help her team to fight on until election day .
the fdp candidate is advising dresden 's citizens to vote tactically . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bellmann 's election campaign poster in dresden " why not vote cdu for your first vote and choose us for the second vote ? " she told voters .
" that way you 'll help the cdu . " german voters cast two votes in bundestag elections , a " first vote " for a constituency representative and a " second vote " for a party list .
the first vote determines half of the parliament 's total composition .
the second vote determines the bundestag 's majority , as the overall proportion of " aye " ballots each party gets in the second vote determines how many candidates from that state list will be granted seats in the bundestag . politicians are not ordinary people this district 160 in dresden includes a number of housing estates , where many residents have a poor opinion of politicians . " those at the top should start making cuts a bit closer to home , " one dresden resident told deutsche welle .
" then we might start listening to them .
whichever party gets in , they should cut their allowances , cut their pensions , and then think about ordinary people . " during the election campaign , bavarian premier and csu party leader edmund stoiber made a serious political mistake by saying that frustrated voters in the former east should not determine the election outcome .
now they have the chance to do this , and the conservatives may suffer . but cdu candidate andreas lämmel is not disheartened .
lämmel is fighting for the last seat in the bundestag and his chances are looking fairly good . help thy political opponent lämmel 's political opponents are also doing him a favor .
many of dresden 's residents think that chancellor schröder and the social democrats are poor losers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " and what happens to me ? " reads the mock poster by the youth group of bavaria 's christian social union " well , we do n't have to do much at all right now , " lämmel said .
" schröder 's appearance on the night of the election , and the activities of the spd since then mean that i 'm having no problems with convincing people germany needs the cdu . " in a televised appearance on the night of the german election , schröder pushed forward his claim to chancellorship in a way which many observers found to be too belligerent .
but the social democrats are not the only rival that the cdu is facing .
the successors to the former communist party , the left party - formerly known as pds - is running neck and neck with the cdu .
in the bundestag elections , they won the vote of almost a quarter of electors in eastern germany . feeling important in dresden , residents are aware of how the rest of the country voted , and now the whole of germany wants to know how they will vote . " i think it 's great , " one voter said .
" i 've already sent off my postal vote and this time my choice was different from what i 'd originally planned .
it was more a case of seeing how everyone else voted and then deciding what to do . " bildunterschrift : one of them is bound to smile sunday night the coming weekend in dresden is bound to be filled with excitement .
although nobody - not even thomas gottschalk - will dare to bet on the outcome . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu , spd search for common ground consensus was building tuesday between germany 's two biggest parties on forming a " grand coalition " government to end political stalemate , but a bitter power struggle over the chancellery could still torpedo a deal .

ratzinger was at that time a member of the ministry , becoming its head two years later .
the swiss theologian had been accused of having " strayed from the truth of the catholic faith . " a supporter of dialogue between religion and science and of a greater role for women within the church , küng was particularly critical of pope jean paul ii 's pontificate , which he accused in 2003 of having " killed all life in the church . " although the pair had fallen out , the dissident theologian said he saw some " signs of hope " in ratzinger 's election as pope . the dawn of a new era ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the vatican becoming more liberal ?
this is not the first controversial move of the new pope .
in august , benedict xvi met with bishop bernard fellay , leader of the catholic ultraconservative brotherhood established in 1969 by the french-born archbishop marcel lefebvre , who was excommunicated in 1976 for opposing the reforms of the second vatican council . the italian press has reacted positively to benedict xvi willingness to talk to his doctrinal opponents .
la stampa wrote on tuesday that the " pope wants not only to abate , but perhaps even end the conflict with the catholic right and catholic left .
this is not about ignoring differences , but rather about building bridges toward a new dialogue . " even though the talks with the pope did not produce any dramatic results , küng said on monday that the meeting was a sign " that this pope does not look towards the past and does not withdraw from the world .

abimael guzman was tried in 1992 by a secret military court and sentenced to life in prison .
two years ago that verdict was ruled unconstitutional .
a 2004 retrial collapsed when two judges stood down .
the shining path , a maoist guerrilla group , waged a violent campaign to overthrow the peruvian state .
the group is blamed for the majority of 70,000 deaths since peru 's insurgency broke out in the 1980s .
the trial is taking place at a maximum security naval base near the capital lima .
officials are determined to avoid any repeat of the scenes of 2004 , when he and his lover , fellow commander elena iparraguirre , commandeered the courtroom on its opening day .
ms iparraguirre was later transferred to another prison .
tv crews have been banned from the courtroom this time , and the former rebel leader , who last time raised his fist and chanted communist slogans , sat quietly during monday 's four-hour hearing .
his lawyer , manuel fajardo , said mr guzman , 70 , had accepted that he would receive an identical life sentence to the one he received in 1993 .
" our expectations are very limited , " he told the associated press news agency .
he added that his client was hoping for a quick trial to avoid wasting his time .
however , proceedings are expected to last between six months and a year .
appeal hope mr guzman , a former philosophy teacher known as president gonzalo to his followers , inspired the shining path throughout the 1980s until his capture in 1992 .
the shining path used violence to try and topple peru 's government and impose what it saw as a pure form of communism on society .
a number of other leaders of the guerrilla movement , including ms iparraguirre , are also on trial .
mr guzman has admitted his central involvement with the group , but denies charges of aggravated terrorism relating to massacres , car bombings and other acts of sabotage attributed to his group .
he is hoping that a quick trial will allow him to take his case to the inter-american commission for human rights , the president of the lima bar association told the associated press .
once his case is heard , mr guzman hopes to discredit peru 's judicial system and free hundreds of former guerrillas on appeal , marcos ibazeta said .
last year 's retrial ended in chaos 10 days after it began , when two of three judges stepped down after becoming mired in complaints about their previous involvement in rebel trials .

speaking for himself in one of the cases , mr yadav insisted on pleading his own case saying that he was a law graduate and wanted to present his side of the story .
he said that it was perhaps the first case in india , where the initial complainant had become the accused .
the " fodder scam " had first come to light while he was heading the bihar state government , he said .
the central bureau of investigations has so far filed nearly 60 cases in connection with the scandal , in which $ 143m are said to have been siphoned off .

oversight commissioner al hutchinson said 114 of the patten report 's 175 recommendations had been completed .
he also warned that loyalist rioting in belfast earlier this month proved some were still opposed to the changes .
although he did not single out sinn fein , which has yet to endorse the reformed psni , he said " politics has failed policing in northern ireland " .
" this is a general observation rather than a statement directed at any specific political group or individual , and simply points out a fact which has substantial consequences for the necessary reforms to policing .
" coupled with a lack of acceptance , in some quarters , of the individual and societal responsibilities that accompany expected rights , the current democratic deficit creates the risk of either undermining or stagnating efforts to create a widely accepted , human rights-based , accountable policing service .
i have no doubt that judging by past achievements and current efforts , the new beginning for policing will become a reality despite the efforts of those guided by their own narrow agendas al hutchinson oversight commissioner " a return to an embattled , fortressed police service is the goal of only a few .
" i know that the police do not want this , and i remain convinced that the majority of people in northern ireland do not want this either . "
the independent commission on policing for northern ireland , also known as the patten commission , was set up after the good friday agreement in 1998 to develop a framework for a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the whole community .
mr hutchinson is an independent figure charged with overseeing the implementation of the patten report 's 175 recommendations .
he said the situation was being helped by all of the main policing institutions : the police service of northern ireland , the policing board which holds chief constable sir hugh orde to account , the district policing partnerships and police ombudsman nuala o 'loan .
the oversight commissioner said that any lack of progress on the 61 remaining recommendations could not be blamed on reluctance or inability within these agencies .
" far more the fact that even at this advanced stage of policing change the full community and political support which would complete this crucial process is still being withheld , " he said .
" this is both illogical and shortsighted . "
mr hutchinson said loyalist riots sparked by a re-routed orange order parade in belfast earlier this month was in contrast to the many significant policing advancements , comparing the violence to that of northern ireland 's darkest days .
" if nothing else , the unfortunate events of early september serve to highlight and test the crucial role that accountability structures will play in the future of policing in northern ireland , and the perceptive nature of the independent commission -lrb- patten -rrb- 's recommendations in this regard .
it is a further exposure of those who continue to lack the courage and capacity to make policing work alex attwood sdlp policing spokesman " the next few months will be critical , and i would not wish to give the impression that the reforms recommended by the independent commission can be brought about under any circumstance .
" that being said , however , i have no doubt that judging by past achievements and current efforts , the new beginning for policing will become a reality despite the efforts of those guided by their own narrow agendas . "
mr hutchinson , an officer with the royal canadian mounted police for 34 years , took over as oversight commissioner from tom constantine who held the position from may 2000 until his retirement at the end of 2003 .
security minister shaun woodward said it was timely that mr hutchinson had focused his 14th report on the critically important themes of human rights and accountability .
sdlp policing spokesman alex attwood said it was a " vindication " of those participating in the new policing structures and " a further exposure of those who continue to lack the courage and capacity to make policing work " .

oversight commissioner al hutchinson said 114 of the patten report 's 175 recommendations had been completed .
he also warned that loyalist rioting in belfast earlier this month proved some were still opposed to the changes .
although he did not single out sinn fein , which has yet to endorse the reformed psni , he said " politics has failed policing in northern ireland " .
" this is a general observation rather than a statement directed at any specific political group or individual , and simply points out a fact which has substantial consequences for the necessary reforms to policing .
" coupled with a lack of acceptance , in some quarters , of the individual and societal responsibilities that accompany expected rights , the current democratic deficit creates the risk of either undermining or stagnating efforts to create a widely accepted , human rights-based , accountable policing service .

" i know that the police do not want this , and i remain convinced that the majority of people in northern ireland do not want this either . "
the independent commission on policing for northern ireland , also known as the patten commission , was set up after the good friday agreement in 1998 to develop a framework for a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the whole community .
mr hutchinson is an independent figure charged with overseeing the implementation of the patten report 's 175 recommendations .
he said the situation was being helped by all of the main policing institutions : the police service of northern ireland , the policing board which holds chief constable sir hugh orde to account , the district policing partnerships and police ombudsman nuala o 'loan .
the oversight commissioner said that any lack of progress on the 61 remaining recommendations could not be blamed on reluctance or inability within these agencies .
" far more the fact that even at this advanced stage of policing change the full community and political support which would complete this crucial process is still being withheld , " he said .
" this is both illogical and shortsighted . "
mr hutchinson said loyalist riots sparked by a re-routed orange order parade in belfast earlier this month was in contrast to the many significant policing advancements , comparing the violence to that of northern ireland 's darkest days .
" if nothing else , the unfortunate events of early september serve to highlight and test the crucial role that accountability structures will play in the future of policing in northern ireland , and the perceptive nature of the independent commission -lrb- patten -rrb- 's recommendations in this regard .

raymond is just one of the many thousands returning home to the disaster-struck city for the first time after a month spent in fema shelters or relying on the kindness of friends .
like so many others he had fled the city in a hurry , taking little with him as he expected to be back in just a few days .
" it 's my birthday on 27 august , the day before katrina hit , so me and my girlfriend had been out to celebrate , " he explained .
" basically we had gone home and were asleep when my friend sean phoned and said : ' do you know how big this storm that 's coming is ?
have n't you seen the reports ?
you need to get out now ! " '
" so we just packed two changes of clothes and left . "
shelter nightmare raymond and girlfriend jane stubbs then began their month-long stint away from home .
they first headed to houston , spending two days in a hotel , before moving south to galveston , where jane 's parents live .
galveston was itself hit by the region 's second terrible hurricane , rita , on friday night , but by then the couple had moved on .
" we 've spoken to them and apparently their house was n't too badly hit , " raymond said .
the couple spent a week and a half in galveston , but heard that in order to qualify for the help fema was offering katrina 's victims they would have to get into one of the official relief shelters .
so they travelled up to austin and moved into a shelter at the city 's convention centre for three days .
once there jane and raymond were given spare underwear and a box for their meagre possessions , as well as food stamps and the $ 2,000 -lrb- £ 1,130 -rrb- cheque that the evacuees are each being given by fema to help them get back on their feet .
but as far as raymond is concerned the experience at the shelter was something they both could really have done without .
" they did n't know what they were doing .
it was basically three days of queuing , " raymond said .
" three days with no privacy surrounded by the noise of everyone else there . "
now after weeks of sleeping on a friend 's floor raymond is finally being allowed back into his house in the uptown area of new orleans .
social burden ?
peering out of the aeroplane windows as you fly over the city into louis armstrong airport you get the impression that most new orleans residents must have a swimming pool in their back yard .
a closer look reveals that the patches of blue below are in fact blue tarpaulins covering the tops of houses where the roofs used to be .
and these of course are the outskirts - elsewhere has been much harder hit .
raymond knows that uptown , which sits on high ground , was spared the worst ravages of the flooding , but nonetheless he is still angry .
" everyone in new orleans has known for years that the levees would not hold if we took a direct hit , " he said .
" if we all knew it , how come the politicians did n't ? "
patrick callahan , who is returning to the newly opened algiers area of the city , is similarly bitter .
" i have lived in new orleans my whole life and we always knew it would n't even withstand a category three , " he said .
" we knew that if we ever did get a direct hit it would be really , really bad and that going to the superdome would be a very bad idea . "
" i am just a resident .
if the residents knew it , why did n't they ? "
as the rest of the country ponders the enormous cost of repairing and rebuilding new orleans , politicians and media pundits alike have been filling the tv news channels with their views of what to do next .
many have been critical of the city 's poor , unemployed residents and the drain they make on the us welfare system , a view which has appalled patrick .
" you know when people in america want to party , to have a good time ; they all just love new orleans , " he said .
" but now we need their help , they complain about us being a welfare state . "

" it 's my birthday on 27 august , the day before katrina hit , so me and my girlfriend had been out to celebrate , " he explained .
" basically we had gone home and were asleep when my friend sean phoned and said : ' do you know how big this storm that 's coming is ?
have n't you seen the reports ?
you need to get out now ! " '
" so we just packed two changes of clothes and left . "
shelter nightmare raymond and girlfriend jane stubbs then began their month-long stint away from home .
they first headed to houston , spending two days in a hotel , before moving south to galveston , where jane 's parents live .
galveston was itself hit by the region 's second terrible hurricane , rita , on friday night , but by then the couple had moved on .
the salvation army help clean up after hurricane rita in pictures " we 've spoken to them and apparently their house was n't too badly hit , " raymond said .
the couple spent a week and a half in galveston , but heard that in order to qualify for the help fema was offering katrina 's victims they would have to get into one of the official relief shelters .
so they travelled up to austin and moved into a shelter at the city 's convention centre for three days .
once there jane and raymond were given spare underwear and a box for their meagre possessions , as well as food stamps and the $ 2,000 -lrb- £ 1,130 -rrb- cheque that the evacuees are each being given by fema to help them get back on their feet .
but as far as raymond is concerned the experience at the shelter was something they both could really have done without .
" they did n't know what they were doing .
it was basically three days of queuing , " raymond said .
" three days with no privacy surrounded by the noise of everyone else there . "
now after weeks of sleeping on a friend 's floor raymond is finally being allowed back into his house in the uptown area of new orleans .
social burden ?
peering out of the aeroplane windows as you fly over the city into louis armstrong airport you get the impression that most new orleans residents must have a swimming pool in their back yard .
a closer look reveals that the patches of blue below are in fact blue tarpaulins covering the tops of houses where the roofs used to be .
and these of course are the outskirts - elsewhere has been much harder hit .
patrick callahan kept his computer hard drive with him all the time raymond knows that uptown , which sits on high ground , was spared the worst ravages of the flooding , but nonetheless he is still angry .
" everyone in new orleans has known for years that the levees would not hold if we took a direct hit , " he said .
" if we all knew it , how come the politicians did n't ? "
patrick callahan , who is returning to the newly opened algiers area of the city , is similarly bitter .
" i have lived in new orleans my whole life and we always knew it would n't even withstand a category three , " he said .
" we knew that if we ever did get a direct hit it would be really , really bad and that going to the superdome would be a very bad idea . "
" i am just a resident .
if the residents knew it , why did n't they ? "
as the rest of the country ponders the enormous cost of repairing and rebuilding new orleans , politicians and media pundits alike have been filling the tv news channels with their views of what to do next .
many have been critical of the city 's poor , unemployed residents and the drain they make on the us welfare system , a view which has appalled patrick .
" you know when people in america want to party , to have a good time ; they all just love new orleans , " he said .
" but now we need their help , they complain about us being a welfare state . "

he said that , despite running a minority administration in cardiff bay , the party had a mandate to deliver .
he and his colleagues would work " with unswerving purpose " , sticking to their assembly election manifesto pledges .
mr morgan told delegates in brighton the welsh assembly government had achieved lower unemployment , record exam results , and better health care .
sharing the platform with welsh secretary peter hain , mr morgan turned his attention to the question of further devolution .
he said that a new government of wales act should be on the books by this time next year and that extra powers were not " a bit of status-seeking " .
instead , they were the tools that he and his government needed " to get a particular job done - in health , or education , or environmnet or local government " .
away from the main stage , critics of mr morgan 's government were launching a demonstration .
around 150 aircraft workers travelled from st athan in the vale of glamorgan with hopes of saving their jobs at the defence aviation repair agency -lrb- dara -rrb- .
hundreds of jobs are expected to to be lost if the mod switches maintenance work on jet fighter aircraft away from dara - a civilian arm of the mod - to an raf base in norfolk .
staff took a giant toilet , stuffed with money , to brighton - a symbolic gesture designed to draw attention to what they claim is a waste of public money .
the south wales plant was officially opened in april , at a cost of £ 80m , and employs about 1,300 people .
key labour figures , past and present are attending the conference .
former labour leader neil kinnock - now lord kinnock - was moved to tears by a touching tribute .
at a reception for welsh delegates , rhodri morgan told members that it was 20 years since kinnock 's " epoch-making " speech to the 1985 party conference .
' proud ' in that speech in bournemouth , the then labour leader attacked militant elements of the party in an address which has been viewed as a landmark moment in the creation of new labour .
delegates watched the famous hugh hudson-directed party political broadcast which became known as " kinnock - the movie " .
lord kinnock wept while watching the film , and recounted stories from his time as a young labour activist , campaigning for jim callaghan in cardiff .
he told welsh party members that the labour party was intrinsically " new " , and said that , if he had played a part in creating the party which had won three successive elections , then he was proud of the achievement .

a team from the welsh school of pharmacy at cardiff university found sponge extracts contained compounds which can block cancer growth .
sponges from the gower peninsula were studied in the research .
medicinal compounds from marine organisms have traditionally been found in species in warm or tropical seas .
preliminary lab tests have shown that extracts from the hymeniacidon sponge are highly effective at inhibiting growth in human breast cancer and some lung cancer cell lines .
lead researcher dr alex white said the sponges had been dried out , and then ground into a powder .
sponges sponges have tiny pores on their outer walls through which water is drawn cells in the sponge filter out nutrients from the water as it is pumped through its body sponge cells perform a variety of bodily functions and seem to be more independent of one other than the cells of other animals this enabled the scientists to extract compounds to test on cells - but at this stage it was still unclear exactly which of the extracts had a positive effect .
dr white said : " the sponge is made up of a complex mixture of compounds .
" the next step is to try to characterise the natural products responsible for the anti-proliferative properties and to identify lead compounds for further development .
" it is not uncommon to find extracts from marine organisms , especially sponges , which have this type of activity .
" but british sponges , and their medicinal properties , are largely unexplored and have untapped potential for the discovery of new drugs . "
rich potential dr kat arney , of cancer research uk , said : " creatures and plants from the sea are a rich source of potential anti-cancer agents , and these results suggest there are possible new treatments hiding within british sea sponges .
" but the research is still at a very early stage and these experiments have only been done in laboratory-grown cells .
" scientists need to discover precisely which molecules within the sponge are responsible for the effects and how they work .
" they will then need to find out if they have an anti-cancer effect on tumours in humans . "
dr sarah rawlings , of the charity breakthrough breast cancer , agreed .
she said : " although this research is certainly fascinating , it 's too early to say whether compounds from these sponges could be used to treat breast cancer patients .
" more work is needed but studies like this are to be welcomed as they are important in helping find possible new treatments for the future . "

details of the deal will be released after a staff meeting on wednesday .
but if the deal is ratified by both sides , they say they will work together to " rebuild trust and confidence " .
the dispute started in august when the caterer sacked 670 workers in a row over restructuring .
staff at british airways then walked out in sympathy .
the gate gourmet workers had staged an illegal walkout to protest against the firm 's hiring of temporary seasonal workers .
" both the company and the union are pleased that a way forward has been found and , if the agreement is ratified , both sides have committed to working together to rebuild trust and confidence after all the difficulties of recent weeks , " said gate gourmet and the union -lrb- t & g -rrb- in a joint statement on monday .
the t & g said it would be holding a mass meeting of staff on wednesday to discuss the settlement , adding it expected to release details of the deal following the talks .

a character simply asked for a cup of tea , and voila - the replicator would make a cuppa .
a machine that can make anything sounds like the stuff of the distant future , but a massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- program is making personal fabrication a reality .
around the world , mit is helping to build fabrication , or " fab " labs , and they are reaping results .
haakon karlsen 's farm sits hundreds of miles north of the arctic circle .
the tinkle of sheep bells is a constant reminder that humans , and their animals , have carved out a life here for thousands of years .
he spends a lot of time thinking about how technology can help him tend his flock .
" it 's not easy to collect sheep in the fall , when it 's dark , " karlsen says , pointing to the nearby peaks .
gps sheep " some sheep are always left up in the mountains .
so , in 1998 , i started to use the first radio around the neck , for sheep up in the mountains . "
karlsen modified a cell phone with global positioning system capabilities .
he strapped the phone onto a sheep collar .
the phone sends a text message with the coordinates of the sheep , and more .
" the phone also sends information about whether the sheep are moving or not , " says karlsen .
" it tells us what the temperature is , and so on .
it tells us a bit about the condition the sheep are in up in the mountains . "
karlsen 's mobile phone for sheep is a perfect example of what mit professor neil gershenfeld calls " personal fabrication " .
" by personal fabrication , what i mean is ordinary people creating , rather than consuming technology , creating technology to solve local problems , " gershenfeld says .
this is n't a corporation , this is n't a university , it is sort of a hub of a global network .
it is a new organisational structure neil gershenfeld , mit gershenfeld directs mit 's center for bits and atoms , a program whose future aim is inspired by the replicator idea from star trek .
" the research is aiming to make a molecular assembler , one machine that can build , on a molecular scale , anything , " says gershenfeld .
at first glance , that research might seem to have little to do with ordinary people and local problems .
but then gershenfeld discovered what he calls " a small side hack " that has practical benefits .
since it started four years ago , the centre has had an outreach program that allowed people of all ages to use some of the lab 's software and machines .
with minimal training , children and adults alike were designing and fabricating their own toys , jewellery , and even their own circuit boards .
gershenfeld dubbed the pared-down set of tools and software that the centre made available to lay people a fabrication , or fab lab .
he built one in boston , and another in costa rica .
fab divide " in a world of fab labs , you can think about the other five and a half billion brains on the planet not just as potential consumers , but as creators , as inventors .
" creation itself can become much more distributed , and you can bring not information technology , but it development to the masses .
you can close what you might think of as a fabrication divide . "
gershenfeld helped set up a fab lab in karlsen 's barn a couple of years ago .
but so many people came to use it , karlsen decided he needed to expand .
with help from the norwegian government , the norwegian sheepherder built a viking-style great hall to house a fab lab which opened last month .
mit pays for equipment and the host country provides a place inside , next to the sheepskins , banks of pcs with high-speed internet connections hum away .
the fab lab machines include a sign cutter and a laser cutter .
there is a 3-d computer milling machine with enough precision to make circuits .
the software that tells the machines what to do is open source , and has been created by so-called " fab labbers " from across the globe .
john silvester boafo stands next to a small scale , metal prototype of what he calls a fu-fu pounder .
" in every ghanaian home , the main dish is fu-fu , " says boafo , principal at the takoradi technical institute , home to ghana 's fab lab , which opened last year .
" fu-fu is made of plantain and cassava , which are cooked , " he explains .
" after they are cooked , they are put into a mortar , and pounded by hand .
people go through hard labour , just to get a meal to eat .
" so , we thought we could fabricate this machine to alleviate the hard labour they use in pounding . "
boafo says the fu-fu pounder is a good example of the practical projects that the ghanaian fab lab wants to tackle .
one of india 's fab labs is also working on local solutions to local problems .
it has low-cost lighting projects , and is developing a device that will help local farmers test whether the milk they have collected has gone bad .
others focus on education and training , such as costa rica , where there are " construction camps " to teach students the basics of design and engineering .
in setting up the labs , mit pays for the equipment , which can cost between $ 25,000 and $ 40,000 .
the host country or institution provides a place to put the equipment .
fab new level south africa is now taking the fab lab idea to the next level .
the government there is fronting the money for both equipment and space , not just for one fab lab , but for an initial round of four of them .
the first is being built just outside of pretoria , in what is billed as south africa 's first " science park , " according to sushil borde , who heads the government agency in charge of the fab lab roll-out .
it is not fully operational , but interest is high .
" we have these very high-tech small start-up companies that are excited by the proximity of the lab , " borde says .
" the companies say , ' we have these brilliant ideas , we have these business models , but we do n't know how to get these ideas into tangible products . " '
borde hopes that a network of fab labs will enable south african entrepreneurs and engineers alike to test their ideas , and " fast track the process of growth and development " .
the network of labs is also paying dividends for research at mit .
graduate student amy sun is working on designs for small solar reflectors that are easy to manufacture .
sun , who has helped set up labs , had the idea because almost everywhere she went she found a lack of locally available power .
" it 's extremely frustrating , " sun says .
" we spend a lot of time picking machines that can make nearly anything , and we 're all stuck with this one little problem , which is that we ca n't plug into anything .
" the idea here is to think about getting power not from a central source , but from a small reflector that you can put anywhere you need it . "
solar arrays could help local communities power their own creations it is a possible solution not just for fab labs , but for any part of the world with power problems .
mit 's gershenfeld says that the problem-solving potential of fab labs is causing an explosion of interest in the project .
he thinks that , more fundamentally , the idea of personal or small-group fabrication has tapped into the primal need that some people have to create things , to modify the world in which they live .
standing in karlsen 's lab , gershenfeld says : " this large , viking-style building is how you build not just a room , but a community .
this is n't a corporation , this is n't a university , it is sort of a hub of a global network .
it is a new organisational structure . "
" in a way , the fab labs are havens for inventive outliers in society . "

a character simply asked for a cup of tea , and voila - the replicator would make a cuppa .
a machine that can make anything sounds like the stuff of the distant future , but a massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- program is making personal fabrication a reality .
around the world , mit is helping to build fabrication , or " fab " labs , and they are reaping results .
haakon karlsen 's farm sits hundreds of miles north of the arctic circle .
the tinkle of sheep bells is a constant reminder that humans , and their animals , have carved out a life here for thousands of years .
he spends a lot of time thinking about how technology can help him tend his flock .
" it 's not easy to collect sheep in the fall , when it 's dark , " karlsen says , pointing to the nearby peaks .
gps sheep " some sheep are always left up in the mountains .
so , in 1998 , i started to use the first radio around the neck , for sheep up in the mountains . "
karlsen modified a cell phone with global positioning system capabilities .
he strapped the phone onto a sheep collar .
the phone sends a text message with the coordinates of the sheep , and more .
" the phone also sends information about whether the sheep are moving or not , " says karlsen .
" it tells us what the temperature is , and so on .
it tells us a bit about the condition the sheep are in up in the mountains . "
karlsen 's mobile phone for sheep is a perfect example of what mit professor neil gershenfeld calls " personal fabrication " .
" by personal fabrication , what i mean is ordinary people creating , rather than consuming technology , creating technology to solve local problems , " gershenfeld says .
this is n't a corporation , this is n't a university , it is sort of a hub of a global network .
it is a new organisational structure neil gershenfeld , mit gershenfeld directs mit 's center for bits and atoms , a program whose future aim is inspired by the replicator idea from star trek .
" the research is aiming to make a molecular assembler , one machine that can build , on a molecular scale , anything , " says gershenfeld .
at first glance , that research might seem to have little to do with ordinary people and local problems .
but then gershenfeld discovered what he calls " a small side hack " that has practical benefits .
since it started four years ago , the centre has had an outreach program that allowed people of all ages to use some of the lab 's software and machines .
with minimal training , children and adults alike were designing and fabricating their own toys , jewellery , and even their own circuit boards .
gershenfeld dubbed the pared-down set of tools and software that the centre made available to lay people a fabrication , or fab lab .
he built one in boston , and another in costa rica .
fab divide " in a world of fab labs , you can think about the other five and a half billion brains on the planet not just as potential consumers , but as creators , as inventors .
" creation itself can become much more distributed , and you can bring not information technology , but it development to the masses .
you can close what you might think of as a fabrication divide . "
gershenfeld helped set up a fab lab in karlsen 's barn a couple of years ago .
but so many people came to use it , karlsen decided he needed to expand .
with help from the norwegian government , the norwegian sheepherder built a viking-style great hall to house a fab lab which opened last month .
mit pays for equipment and the host country provides a place inside , next to the sheepskins , banks of pcs with high-speed internet connections hum away .
the fab lab machines include a sign cutter and a laser cutter .
there is a 3-d computer milling machine with enough precision to make circuits .
the software that tells the machines what to do is open source , and has been created by so-called " fab labbers " from across the globe .
john silvester boafo stands next to a small scale , metal prototype of what he calls a fu-fu pounder .
" in every ghanaian home , the main dish is fu-fu , " says boafo , principal at the takoradi technical institute , home to ghana 's fab lab , which opened last year .
" fu-fu is made of plantain and cassava , which are cooked , " he explains .
" after they are cooked , they are put into a mortar , and pounded by hand .
people go through hard labour , just to get a meal to eat .
" so , we thought we could fabricate this machine to alleviate the hard labour they use in pounding . "
boafo says the fu-fu pounder is a good example of the practical projects that the ghanaian fab lab wants to tackle .
one of india 's fab labs is also working on local solutions to local problems .
it has low-cost lighting projects , and is developing a device that will help local farmers test whether the milk they have collected has gone bad .
others focus on education and training , such as costa rica , where there are " construction camps " to teach students the basics of design and engineering .
in setting up the labs , mit pays for the equipment , which can cost between $ 25,000 and $ 40,000 .
the host country or institution provides a place to put the equipment .
fab new level south africa is now taking the fab lab idea to the next level .
the government there is fronting the money for both equipment and space , not just for one fab lab , but for an initial round of four of them .
the first is being built just outside of pretoria , in what is billed as south africa 's first " science park , " according to sushil borde , who heads the government agency in charge of the fab lab roll-out .
it is not fully operational , but interest is high .
" we have these very high-tech small start-up companies that are excited by the proximity of the lab , " borde says .
" the companies say , ' we have these brilliant ideas , we have these business models , but we do n't know how to get these ideas into tangible products . " '
borde hopes that a network of fab labs will enable south african entrepreneurs and engineers alike to test their ideas , and " fast track the process of growth and development " .
the network of labs is also paying dividends for research at mit .
graduate student amy sun is working on designs for small solar reflectors that are easy to manufacture .
sun , who has helped set up labs , had the idea because almost everywhere she went she found a lack of locally available power .
" it 's extremely frustrating , " sun says .
" we spend a lot of time picking machines that can make nearly anything , and we 're all stuck with this one little problem , which is that we ca n't plug into anything .
" the idea here is to think about getting power not from a central source , but from a small reflector that you can put anywhere you need it . "
solar arrays could help local communities power their own creations it is a possible solution not just for fab labs , but for any part of the world with power problems .
mit 's gershenfeld says that the problem-solving potential of fab labs is causing an explosion of interest in the project .
he thinks that , more fundamentally , the idea of personal or small-group fabrication has tapped into the primal need that some people have to create things , to modify the world in which they live .
standing in karlsen 's lab , gershenfeld says : " this large , viking-style building is how you build not just a room , but a community .
this is n't a corporation , this is n't a university , it is sort of a hub of a global network .
it is a new organisational structure . "
" in a way , the fab labs are havens for inventive outliers in society . "

a character simply asked for a cup of tea , and voila - the replicator would make a cuppa .
a machine that can make anything sounds like the stuff of the distant future , but a massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- program is making personal fabrication a reality .
around the world , mit is helping to build fabrication , or " fab " labs , and they are reaping results .
haakon karlsen 's farm sits hundreds of miles north of the arctic circle .
the tinkle of sheep bells is a constant reminder that humans , and their animals , have carved out a life here for thousands of years .
he spends a lot of time thinking about how technology can help him tend his flock .
" it 's not easy to collect sheep in the fall , when it 's dark , " karlsen says , pointing to the nearby peaks .
gps sheep " some sheep are always left up in the mountains .
so , in 1998 , i started to use the first radio around the neck , for sheep up in the mountains . "
karlsen modified a cell phone with global positioning system capabilities .
he strapped the phone onto a sheep collar .
the phone sends a text message with the coordinates of the sheep , and more .
" the phone also sends information about whether the sheep are moving or not , " says karlsen .
" it tells us what the temperature is , and so on .
it tells us a bit about the condition the sheep are in up in the mountains . "
karlsen 's mobile phone for sheep is a perfect example of what mit professor neil gershenfeld calls " personal fabrication " .
" by personal fabrication , what i mean is ordinary people creating , rather than consuming technology , creating technology to solve local problems , " gershenfeld says .
this is n't a corporation , this is n't a university , it is sort of a hub of a global network .
it is a new organisational structure neil gershenfeld , mit gershenfeld directs mit 's center for bits and atoms , a program whose future aim is inspired by the replicator idea from star trek .
" the research is aiming to make a molecular assembler , one machine that can build , on a molecular scale , anything , " says gershenfeld .
at first glance , that research might seem to have little to do with ordinary people and local problems .
but then gershenfeld discovered what he calls " a small side hack " that has practical benefits .
since it started four years ago , the centre has had an outreach program that allowed people of all ages to use some of the lab 's software and machines .
with minimal training , children and adults alike were designing and fabricating their own toys , jewellery , and even their own circuit boards .
gershenfeld dubbed the pared-down set of tools and software that the centre made available to lay people a fabrication , or fab lab .
he built one in boston , and another in costa rica .
fab divide " in a world of fab labs , you can think about the other five and a half billion brains on the planet not just as potential consumers , but as creators , as inventors .
" creation itself can become much more distributed , and you can bring not information technology , but it development to the masses .
you can close what you might think of as a fabrication divide . "
gershenfeld helped set up a fab lab in karlsen 's barn a couple of years ago .
but so many people came to use it , karlsen decided he needed to expand .
with help from the norwegian government , the norwegian sheepherder built a viking-style great hall to house a fab lab which opened last month .
mit pays for equipment and the host country provides a place inside , next to the sheepskins , banks of pcs with high-speed internet connections hum away .
the fab lab machines include a sign cutter and a laser cutter .
there is a 3-d computer milling machine with enough precision to make circuits .
the software that tells the machines what to do is open source , and has been created by so-called " fab labbers " from across the globe .
john silvester boafo stands next to a small scale , metal prototype of what he calls a fu-fu pounder .
" in every ghanaian home , the main dish is fu-fu , " says boafo , principal at the takoradi technical institute , home to ghana 's fab lab , which opened last year .
" fu-fu is made of plantain and cassava , which are cooked , " he explains .
" after they are cooked , they are put into a mortar , and pounded by hand .
people go through hard labour , just to get a meal to eat .
" so , we thought we could fabricate this machine to alleviate the hard labour they use in pounding . "
boafo says the fu-fu pounder is a good example of the practical projects that the ghanaian fab lab wants to tackle .
one of india 's fab labs is also working on local solutions to local problems .
it has low-cost lighting projects , and is developing a device that will help local farmers test whether the milk they have collected has gone bad .
others focus on education and training , such as costa rica , where there are " construction camps " to teach students the basics of design and engineering .
in setting up the labs , mit pays for the equipment , which can cost between $ 25,000 and $ 40,000 .
the host country or institution provides a place to put the equipment .
fab new level south africa is now taking the fab lab idea to the next level .
the government there is fronting the money for both equipment and space , not just for one fab lab , but for an initial round of four of them .
the first is being built just outside of pretoria , in what is billed as south africa 's first " science park , " according to sushil borde , who heads the government agency in charge of the fab lab roll-out .
it is not fully operational , but interest is high .
" we have these very high-tech small start-up companies that are excited by the proximity of the lab , " borde says .
