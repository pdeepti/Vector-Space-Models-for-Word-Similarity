to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .
" many people concentrate on the food aspect , " said christoph asseuer .
" i 'd rather concentrate on the fact of a monopoly that a certain corporation holds on the seeds -lrb- ... -rrb-
the variety of seeds is in great danger of being throttled by the attempt to monopolize certain seeds and take certain seeds out of the market . "
monsanto bears responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is a leading producer of genetically modified crops asseuer did n't specifically name which company he was talking about , but the one bearing the brunt of attacks from most gm opponents is monsanto .
martin webber also saw sinister motives behind monsanto 's gm marketing .
" they will set up a monopoly situation here , " he said .
" it 's like in india or south america .
people from there say sooner or later that you lose your farm because you ca n't compete anymore .
i do n't want that so i 'm going to throw them out .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .
" many people concentrate on the food aspect , " said christoph asseuer .
" i 'd rather concentrate on the fact of a monopoly that a certain corporation holds on the seeds -lrb- ... -rrb-
the variety of seeds is in great danger of being throttled by the attempt to monopolize certain seeds and take certain seeds out of the market . "
monsanto bears responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is a leading producer of genetically modified crops asseuer did n't specifically name which company he was talking about , but the one bearing the brunt of attacks from most gm opponents is monsanto .
martin webber also saw sinister motives behind monsanto 's gm marketing .
" they will set up a monopoly situation here , " he said .
" it 's like in india or south america .
people from there say sooner or later that you lose your farm because you ca n't compete anymore .

a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .

eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .

brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .
18 .
eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- outside view of a house in brieskow-finkenheerd , south of frankfurt-oder in the german state brandenburg where police discovered the remains of nine newborn babies buried in the garden near the garage and arrested a woman believed to be the children 's mother , prosecutors said monday aug .

the bodies were found sunday in brieskow-finkenheerd , a village near the polish border , after police received a tip-off , said michael neff , a spokesman for prosecutors in nearby frankfurt an der oder .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- a police spokesman in the city of frankfurt an der oder on the polish border , where the 39-year-old suspect identified as sabine h. lived , said they were focusing in particular on an apartment in the nearby city of eisenhüttenstadt .
he said the aim of the new searches was to rule out other victims . the public prosecutor 's office said the 39-year-old mother was still being questioned after telling investigators she had only hazy memories of giving birth to the children while heavily intoxicated between 1988 and 1999 and leaving at least one to die under a blanket . sabine h. said she stored the corpses in flower boxes and pots on her balcony before depositing them in a family shed .
she said that all the children were fathered by her estranged husband , whom she finally divorced in may . pathologists were still trying to determine the infants ' cause of death .
authorities had initially said the births had taken place over a 16-year period but new findings from the mothers ' interrogation revealed a nearly unbroken cycle of pregnancies and deaths .
investigators were also speaking with friends and relatives of the suspect , who is also the mother of four living children . an acquaintance discovered small human bones in an old aquarium sunday after being asked to clear out a shed belonging to the family .
he alerted police , who then uncovered the remains of eight other babies hidden in flower boxes and pots in the shed and in buckets buried under sand and earth . comments on crime rile east german politicians brandenburg state interior minister jörg schönbohm blamed the legacy of communist east germany and a " forced proletarianization , " saying it had broken down societal structures leading citizens to turn a blind eye to violence and suffering . " this unbelievable indifference is what strikes me the most , " schönbohm said in an interview in wednesday 's berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" i can not understand how no one saw that this woman was in a critical situation and needed help .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .
" many people concentrate on the food aspect , " said christoph asseuer .
" i 'd rather concentrate on the fact of a monopoly that a certain corporation holds on the seeds -lrb- ... -rrb-
the variety of seeds is in great danger of being throttled by the attempt to monopolize certain seeds and take certain seeds out of the market . "

" they will set up a monopoly situation here , " he said .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .
" many people concentrate on the food aspect , " said christoph asseuer .
" i 'd rather concentrate on the fact of a monopoly that a certain corporation holds on the seeds -lrb- ... -rrb-
the variety of seeds is in great danger of being throttled by the attempt to monopolize certain seeds and take certain seeds out of the market . "
monsanto bears responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is a leading producer of genetically modified crops asseuer did n't specifically name which company he was talking about , but the one bearing the brunt of attacks from most gm opponents is monsanto .
martin webber also saw sinister motives behind monsanto 's gm marketing .
" they will set up a monopoly situation here , " he said .
" it 's like in india or south america .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .

his junior defence minister at the time , holger pfahls , 62 , had no influence on the deal , the former chancellor said , effectively clearing pfahls of bribery charges . kohl said that he promised former us secretary of state james baker in 1990 that germany would export tanks to saudi arabia .

a verdict is expected on aug.11. no new evidence on cdu scandal kohl 's testimony was eagerly awaited in germany , as the former leader 's own reputation was badly damaged in 1999 when it emerged his cdu party had been involved in receiving illegal donations through a secret slush fund . kohl swore never to reveal the names of the donors , though german police suspect that schreiber was among them .

the boards of the two companies decided that adidas would purchase the outstanding reebok shares for $ 59 -lrb- 48 euros -rrb- a piece , a premium of 34.2 percent over the closing price of reebok shares had on tuesday evening . the deal is yet to be approved by reebok shareholders and anti-trust authorities , and is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2006 . increased market presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a good year for adidas executive board director herbert hainer the complementary strengths of the two brands in different geographic locations and consumer segments will provide a significant opportunity for value growth . we will gain an unprecedented presence on the market , " said adidas executive board director , herbert hainer . reebok has a particularly strong presence on the us market with nfl -lrb- national football association -rrb- and nba -lrb- national basketball association -rrb- , whereas adidas ' traditional strongholds are the world soccer body fifa , olympic games and european soccer champions league . reebok chairman paul fireman , who holds 17 percent of the sports-shoe maker along with his wife phyllis , has already signalled he would sell his shares . " adidas is the perfect partner for reebok .

its earnings raced ahead in the second quarter , boosted by strong demand for its running shoes . adidas booked net profit of 67 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- in the period from april to june , up 48.5 percent from the year-earlier figure .
operating profit was up 24.6 percent at 153 million euros and sales rose by 8.2 percent to 1.516 billion euros . " the first six months of 2005 were important for adidas-salomon , " heiner said .
" we have made our business essentially stronger and more efficient . " in may , the german group announced it had agreed to sell its french subsidiary salomon to finnish firm amer sports corporation for around 485 million euros .
salomon specializes in winter sports , alpine and cross-country skis , snowboards and inline skates . salomon will change owners in september . with the purchase of reebok , adidas will close the distance with its arch-enemy and world leader nike .
according to expert estimates , nike currently dominates around 30 percent of the world market .
adidas and reebok put together will control around 20 percent . world cup fever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa world cup in germany 2006 is expected to drive additional sales for adidas although no international sporting events on the scale of the olympic games are planned in 2005 that could serve as sales catalysts , the sport industry , and adidas , in particular , is counting on the fifa world cup , which will take place in germany in 2006 , to drive sales in the second half of this year as well . worldwide market potential for the soccer business is estimated to 2.6 billion euros in 2005 and is expected to rise to 3 billion euros in 2006 . investors were initially taken by surprise by adidas ' announcement it was taking over reebok .
adidas shares hit an intra-day low of 141.50 euros early in the session , down 4.0 percent on the day . soon , however , investors began to warm up to the idea and were also cheered by the better-than-expected second-quarter results .
in late morning trading , adidas shares had come off their lows to show a loss of just 0.24 percent at 147.16 euros . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma battling to tear stripe off adidas all 's fair in love , war ... and the sportswear market , apparently .

a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .

eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2005 gm corn protesters send message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people would like to go so far with gm corn in germany the issue of genetically-modified corn strikes a nerve with many europeans .
to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .
" many people concentrate on the food aspect , " said christoph asseuer .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .

some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 03.08.2005 political heavyweights eye one-round bout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloves are off : schröder gets one chance to k.o. rival merkel german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will face each other in a single televised debate on september 4 .
it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .
" many people concentrate on the food aspect , " said christoph asseuer .
" i 'd rather concentrate on the fact of a monopoly that a certain corporation holds on the seeds -lrb- ... -rrb-
the variety of seeds is in great danger of being throttled by the attempt to monopolize certain seeds and take certain seeds out of the market . "
monsanto bears responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is a leading producer of genetically modified crops asseuer did n't specifically name which company he was talking about , but the one bearing the brunt of attacks from most gm opponents is monsanto .
martin webber also saw sinister motives behind monsanto 's gm marketing .
" they will set up a monopoly situation here , " he said .
" it 's like in india or south america .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .
now only a third of the population is of this opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt the majority of elderly people are in good health and want to contribute to social wealth for much longer .
given the current era of high unemployment , this is sometimes being perceived by many as a threat , said social democrat family minister renate schmidt in berlin on wednesday . " this demographic development is still being viewed here as a menace , " she said .
" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise . " employers need to change ageist attitudes schmidt said employers would have to change their current reservations towards employing elderly people in their 50s and 60s , as germany ’ s ageing society could not afford to do without them .
she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added . " and this will be particularly important for the younger generation now , who might still hear from their grandfathers and grandmothers that they are able to live well on their statutory pensions alone .
private pension insurance will play a pivotal role in avoiding an increase in old-age poverty in germany . ” schmidt praises caring elderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister praised the pensioners ’ share in looking after the young generation , while their parents are at work .
family ties , she said , were still very close in germany despite fact that the concept of living together under one roof was an exception rather than the rule . she said that pensioners were also playing a huge role in supporting children financially with a third of all elderly people polled in the study having shelled out no fewer than 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.6 billion -rrb- between 1996 and 2002 alone . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a second bite of the employment cherry retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth .

he said the aim of the new searches was to rule out other victims . the public prosecutor 's office said the 39-year-old mother was still being questioned after telling investigators she had only hazy memories of giving birth to the children while heavily intoxicated between 1988 and 1999 and leaving at least one to die under a blanket . sabine h. said she stored the corpses in flower boxes and pots on her balcony before depositing them in a family shed .
she said that all the children were fathered by her estranged husband , whom she finally divorced in may . pathologists were still trying to determine the infants ' cause of death .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .
former chancellor helmut kohl always refused in the belief that the encounters would merely raise the profile of his challenger . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany braces for election tv duel while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .

salomon specializes in winter sports , alpine and cross-country skis , snowboards and inline skates . salomon will change owners in september . with the purchase of reebok , adidas will close the distance with its arch-enemy and world leader nike .

his junior defence minister at the time , holger pfahls , 62 , had no influence on the deal , the former chancellor said , effectively clearing pfahls of bribery charges . kohl said that he promised former us secretary of state james baker in 1990 that germany would export tanks to saudi arabia .
during the first gulf war , he gave the us all manner of financial and material support in order to prevent sending german troops over to fight , kohl said . he added that he never understood why pfahls would have received any payment in connection with the deal . " the saudis knew that they 'd get their tanks , " kohl said .

he has also admitted to pocketing about a million euros over an 820-million-euro deal to sell armored vehicles to the united states the previous year . according to the charges against him , he failed to declare to tax authorities a " corruption salary " paid into a swiss bank . the presiding judge said at the start of the trial that pfahls could face a relatively lenient sentence of two years and three months in prison if he delivered a full confession .
a verdict is expected on aug.11. no new evidence on cdu scandal kohl 's testimony was eagerly awaited in germany , as the former leader 's own reputation was badly damaged in 1999 when it emerged his cdu party had been involved in receiving illegal donations through a secret slush fund . kohl swore never to reveal the names of the donors , though german police suspect that schreiber was among them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2005 germany defies ban on tobacco advertising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco advertising in germany : no end in sight germany lags behind in implementing an eu-directive prohibiting tobacco advertising .
a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .
18 .
eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .
now only a third of the population is of this opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt the majority of elderly people are in good health and want to contribute to social wealth for much longer .
given the current era of high unemployment , this is sometimes being perceived by many as a threat , said social democrat family minister renate schmidt in berlin on wednesday . " this demographic development is still being viewed here as a menace , " she said .
" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise . " employers need to change ageist attitudes schmidt said employers would have to change their current reservations towards employing elderly people in their 50s and 60s , as germany ’ s ageing society could not afford to do without them .
she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added . " and this will be particularly important for the younger generation now , who might still hear from their grandfathers and grandmothers that they are able to live well on their statutory pensions alone .
private pension insurance will play a pivotal role in avoiding an increase in old-age poverty in germany . ” schmidt praises caring elderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister praised the pensioners ’ share in looking after the young generation , while their parents are at work .
family ties , she said , were still very close in germany despite fact that the concept of living together under one roof was an exception rather than the rule . she said that pensioners were also playing a huge role in supporting children financially with a third of all elderly people polled in the study having shelled out no fewer than 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.6 billion -rrb- between 1996 and 2002 alone . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a second bite of the employment cherry retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth .

here 's what the parties have to say . spd the social democrats want germany to have a permanent seat in the united nations security council .

in addition , civil and peacekeeping missions as well as peace and conflict research should be expanded .
it remains a goal of the spd to ratify the european constitutional contract in all member states .
the spd warns against a breach of promise with bulgaria , romania , or turkey : accession talks should be continued or , in the case of turkey , begun . cdu / csu the christian democrats want to strengthen ties with the primary transatlantic partner , the us , and at the same time cultivate a close relationship with all member states in the european union , not just with france .
the deployment of bundeswehr troops abroad should be continued .
eu regulations should only be implemented in a one-to-one relationship with national regulations .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .

with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2005 germany defies ban on tobacco advertising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco advertising in germany : no end in sight germany lags behind in implementing an eu-directive prohibiting tobacco advertising .
a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .
18 .
eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- feedback is a ban on tobacco advertising the right way to reduce smoking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 03.08.2005 political heavyweights eye one-round bout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloves are off : schröder gets one chance to k.o. rival merkel german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will face each other in a single televised debate on september 4 .
it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .
former chancellor helmut kohl always refused in the belief that the encounters would merely raise the profile of his challenger . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany braces for election tv duel while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .

some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2005 germany defies ban on tobacco advertising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco advertising in germany : no end in sight germany lags behind in implementing an eu-directive prohibiting tobacco advertising .
a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .
18 .
eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2005 germany defies ban on tobacco advertising großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tobacco advertising in germany : no end in sight germany lags behind in implementing an eu-directive prohibiting tobacco advertising .
a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .

eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .

his junior defence minister at the time , holger pfahls , 62 , had no influence on the deal , the former chancellor said , effectively clearing pfahls of bribery charges . kohl said that he promised former us secretary of state james baker in 1990 that germany would export tanks to saudi arabia .
during the first gulf war , he gave the us all manner of financial and material support in order to prevent sending german troops over to fight , kohl said . he added that he never understood why pfahls would have received any payment in connection with the deal . " the saudis knew that they 'd get their tanks , " kohl said .
" it was clear to everyone that i would honor my promise . " kohl stressed that his government had never been open to bribes . " i have no indication of outside influences , " kohl said .
" i was never bribeable and never will be . " tax evasion charges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german state secretary of defense , ludwig holger pfahls pfahls , who is being tried on corruption and tax fraud charges , has admitted taking around 511,000 euros -lrb- $ 630,000 -rrb- from arms dealer karlheinz schreiber in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , but says he did nothing in return .
he has also admitted to pocketing about a million euros over an 820-million-euro deal to sell armored vehicles to the united states the previous year . according to the charges against him , he failed to declare to tax authorities a " corruption salary " paid into a swiss bank . the presiding judge said at the start of the trial that pfahls could face a relatively lenient sentence of two years and three months in prison if he delivered a full confession .
a verdict is expected on aug.11. no new evidence on cdu scandal kohl 's testimony was eagerly awaited in germany , as the former leader 's own reputation was badly damaged in 1999 when it emerged his cdu party had been involved in receiving illegal donations through a secret slush fund . kohl swore never to reveal the names of the donors , though german police suspect that schreiber was among them .
kohl has kept his promise , despite hopes that the pfahls trial might shed more light on the cdu funding scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politically charged trial takes sudden twist a the start of his trial on separate tax evasion and corruption charges over an arms deal with saudi arabia , former german junior defense minister ludwig-holger pfahls admitted in court tuesday to accepting bribes .

she said that all the children were fathered by her estranged husband , whom she finally divorced in may . pathologists were still trying to determine the infants ' cause of death .

a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .
18 .
eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .

4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .

his junior defence minister at the time , holger pfahls , 62 , had no influence on the deal , the former chancellor said , effectively clearing pfahls of bribery charges . kohl said that he promised former us secretary of state james baker in 1990 that germany would export tanks to saudi arabia .
during the first gulf war , he gave the us all manner of financial and material support in order to prevent sending german troops over to fight , kohl said . he added that he never understood why pfahls would have received any payment in connection with the deal . " the saudis knew that they 'd get their tanks , " kohl said .
" it was clear to everyone that i would honor my promise . " kohl stressed that his government had never been open to bribes . " i have no indication of outside influences , " kohl said .
" i was never bribeable and never will be . " tax evasion charges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german state secretary of defense , ludwig holger pfahls pfahls , who is being tried on corruption and tax fraud charges , has admitted taking around 511,000 euros -lrb- $ 630,000 -rrb- from arms dealer karlheinz schreiber in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , but says he did nothing in return .
he has also admitted to pocketing about a million euros over an 820-million-euro deal to sell armored vehicles to the united states the previous year . according to the charges against him , he failed to declare to tax authorities a " corruption salary " paid into a swiss bank . the presiding judge said at the start of the trial that pfahls could face a relatively lenient sentence of two years and three months in prison if he delivered a full confession .
a verdict is expected on aug.11. no new evidence on cdu scandal kohl 's testimony was eagerly awaited in germany , as the former leader 's own reputation was badly damaged in 1999 when it emerged his cdu party had been involved in receiving illegal donations through a secret slush fund . kohl swore never to reveal the names of the donors , though german police suspect that schreiber was among them .
kohl has kept his promise , despite hopes that the pfahls trial might shed more light on the cdu funding scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politically charged trial takes sudden twist a the start of his trial on separate tax evasion and corruption charges over an arms deal with saudi arabia , former german junior defense minister ludwig-holger pfahls admitted in court tuesday to accepting bribes .

he said the aim of the new searches was to rule out other victims . the public prosecutor 's office said the 39-year-old mother was still being questioned after telling investigators she had only hazy memories of giving birth to the children while heavily intoxicated between 1988 and 1999 and leaving at least one to die under a blanket . sabine h. said she stored the corpses in flower boxes and pots on her balcony before depositing them in a family shed .
she said that all the children were fathered by her estranged husband , whom she finally divorced in may . pathologists were still trying to determine the infants ' cause of death .
authorities had initially said the births had taken place over a 16-year period but new findings from the mothers ' interrogation revealed a nearly unbroken cycle of pregnancies and deaths .
investigators were also speaking with friends and relatives of the suspect , who is also the mother of four living children . an acquaintance discovered small human bones in an old aquarium sunday after being asked to clear out a shed belonging to the family .
he alerted police , who then uncovered the remains of eight other babies hidden in flower boxes and pots in the shed and in buckets buried under sand and earth . comments on crime rile east german politicians brandenburg state interior minister jörg schönbohm blamed the legacy of communist east germany and a " forced proletarianization , " saying it had broken down societal structures leading citizens to turn a blind eye to violence and suffering . " this unbelievable indifference is what strikes me the most , " schönbohm said in an interview in wednesday 's berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" i can not understand how no one saw that this woman was in a critical situation and needed help .
what were the parents doing , the neighbors ? " the remarks met with criticism by some eastern german politicians , with eckhardt rehberg in the neighboring state of mecklenburg-western pommerania warning against a " one-sided judgment against the actions of an entire population " . the chairman of the new left party , lothar bisky , said such comments reflected outdated cold war rhetoric and noted west germany also had its share of serious crimes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mother of dead babies ca n't recall killings the woman suspected of killing nine newborn babies found buried in eastern germany confirmed on tuesday that they were her children but can not recall how they were killed , officials said at a press conference .

he said the aim of the new searches was to rule out other victims . the public prosecutor 's office said the 39-year-old mother was still being questioned after telling investigators she had only hazy memories of giving birth to the children while heavily intoxicated between 1988 and 1999 and leaving at least one to die under a blanket . sabine h. said she stored the corpses in flower boxes and pots on her balcony before depositing them in a family shed .
she said that all the children were fathered by her estranged husband , whom she finally divorced in may . pathologists were still trying to determine the infants ' cause of death .
authorities had initially said the births had taken place over a 16-year period but new findings from the mothers ' interrogation revealed a nearly unbroken cycle of pregnancies and deaths .
investigators were also speaking with friends and relatives of the suspect , who is also the mother of four living children . an acquaintance discovered small human bones in an old aquarium sunday after being asked to clear out a shed belonging to the family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 03.08.2005 political heavyweights eye one-round bout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloves are off : schröder gets one chance to k.o. rival merkel german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will face each other in a single televised debate on september 4 .
it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .
former chancellor helmut kohl always refused in the belief that the encounters would merely raise the profile of his challenger . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany braces for election tv duel while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .
now only a third of the population is of this opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt the majority of elderly people are in good health and want to contribute to social wealth for much longer .
given the current era of high unemployment , this is sometimes being perceived by many as a threat , said social democrat family minister renate schmidt in berlin on wednesday . " this demographic development is still being viewed here as a menace , " she said .
" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise . " employers need to change ageist attitudes schmidt said employers would have to change their current reservations towards employing elderly people in their 50s and 60s , as germany ’ s ageing society could not afford to do without them .
she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added . " and this will be particularly important for the younger generation now , who might still hear from their grandfathers and grandmothers that they are able to live well on their statutory pensions alone .
private pension insurance will play a pivotal role in avoiding an increase in old-age poverty in germany . ” schmidt praises caring elderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister praised the pensioners ’ share in looking after the young generation , while their parents are at work .
family ties , she said , were still very close in germany despite fact that the concept of living together under one roof was an exception rather than the rule . she said that pensioners were also playing a huge role in supporting children financially with a third of all elderly people polled in the study having shelled out no fewer than 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.6 billion -rrb- between 1996 and 2002 alone . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a second bite of the employment cherry retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2005 gm corn protesters send message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people would like to go so far with gm corn in germany the issue of genetically-modified corn strikes a nerve with many europeans .
to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .

some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .

" in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , schily said , referring to islamic extremists , that there were known menaces in germany who could not be deported because they faced the death penalty in their home country or because they had become german subjects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily " however , if you know for certain they 're dangerous , but do n't have any concrete evidence of a criminal act , is it completely unimaginable to hold them in custody for a certain period to ward off danger and for public safety ? "
schily said . " we need to think about it " the interior minister added that he was aware of the fact that there is no majority currently for introducing preventative custody , but that it was necessary to start a " theoretical debate " about the issue . " we need to think about it , " he said . another important preventative measure against terrorism was integration and assimilation of foreigners , schily said in the interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration and assimilation of foreigners in germany will make the country safer , german interior minister otto schily said .
" assimilation is not the same thing as denying oneself , " he said .
" mustafa will still be called mustafa and go to a mosque . " but he said that the more germany successfully encouraged immigrants to adopt german values , the more immunity against terrorist propaganda would increase . germany is not the first european government to mull the prospect of preventative custody .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .

some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .

webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .
" many people concentrate on the food aspect , " said christoph asseuer .
" i 'd rather concentrate on the fact of a monopoly that a certain corporation holds on the seeds -lrb- ... -rrb-

"
schily said . " we need to think about it " the interior minister added that he was aware of the fact that there is no majority currently for introducing preventative custody , but that it was necessary to start a " theoretical debate " about the issue . " we need to think about it , " he said . another important preventative measure against terrorism was integration and assimilation of foreigners , schily said in the interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration and assimilation of foreigners in germany will make the country safer , german interior minister otto schily said .
" assimilation is not the same thing as denying oneself , " he said .
" mustafa will still be called mustafa and go to a mosque . " but he said that the more germany successfully encouraged immigrants to adopt german values , the more immunity against terrorist propaganda would increase . germany is not the first european government to mull the prospect of preventative custody .

brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .
18 .
eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .
europe 's anti-smoking battle dossier : since ireland became the first country in europe to ban smoking in public , other countries have been fast following suit .
-lrb- may 31 , 2005 -rrb- feedback is a ban on tobacco advertising the right way to reduce smoking ?

"
schily said . " we need to think about it " the interior minister added that he was aware of the fact that there is no majority currently for introducing preventative custody , but that it was necessary to start a " theoretical debate " about the issue .

" but he said that the more germany successfully encouraged immigrants to adopt german values , the more immunity against terrorist propaganda would increase . germany is not the first european government to mull the prospect of preventative custody .

a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .
18 .
eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2005 gm corn protesters send message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people would like to go so far with gm corn in germany the issue of genetically-modified corn strikes a nerve with many europeans .
to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .
" many people concentrate on the food aspect , " said christoph asseuer .
" i 'd rather concentrate on the fact of a monopoly that a certain corporation holds on the seeds -lrb- ... -rrb-
the variety of seeds is in great danger of being throttled by the attempt to monopolize certain seeds and take certain seeds out of the market . "
monsanto bears responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monsanto is a leading producer of genetically modified crops asseuer did n't specifically name which company he was talking about , but the one bearing the brunt of attacks from most gm opponents is monsanto .
martin webber also saw sinister motives behind monsanto 's gm marketing .
" they will set up a monopoly situation here , " he said .
" it 's like in india or south america .
people from there say sooner or later that you lose your farm because you ca n't compete anymore .
i do n't want that so i 'm going to throw them out .

" in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , schily said , referring to islamic extremists , that there were known menaces in germany who could not be deported because they faced the death penalty in their home country or because they had become german subjects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily " however , if you know for certain they 're dangerous , but do n't have any concrete evidence of a criminal act , is it completely unimaginable to hold them in custody for a certain period to ward off danger and for public safety ? "
schily said . " we need to think about it " the interior minister added that he was aware of the fact that there is no majority currently for introducing preventative custody , but that it was necessary to start a " theoretical debate " about the issue . " we need to think about it , " he said . another important preventative measure against terrorism was integration and assimilation of foreigners , schily said in the interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration and assimilation of foreigners in germany will make the country safer , german interior minister otto schily said .
" assimilation is not the same thing as denying oneself , " he said .

a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .

eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

to vent their indignation about the lifting of a moratorium , ecology campaigners protested at a gm cornfield near berlin . on sunday , up to 400 ecology campaigners from western europe flocked to a small village some 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- outside of berlin to join forces for a protest action which they called " voluntary field liberation . "
their plan was to symbolically destroy some genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- corn in a field outside of the village hohenstein .
one organizer , michael grolm , said the protesters did not come to destroy the crops in the field , but the provocative nature of the name , directed towards a farmer who is growing gm corn on his land , forced police to counter with a strong presence .
according to grolm , the large number of police officers needed to protect the relatively small parcel of land meant the protest was a success .
in his words , farmers and companies who want to propagate the advantages of gm grains , will have a " difficult time " if so many police officers are needed to protect farmland where gm crops are supposed to be grown .
protesters see two-fold danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opponents feel that not enough research has been done to assure that genetically modified grain , here soy beans , is safe ecology proponents and anti-globalization protesters showed up from germany , switzerland , austria , italy and france to demonstrate against what they believe to be a two-fold danger brought on by an increased usage of gm crops .
some were enraged by the fact that the cornfield directly neighbors a natural park , calling it a provocation .
" it is n't clear what genetically modified grains do , " said martin webber , who spearheaded the campaign in hohenstein .
webber said that he has heard of studies that some species crucial to ecosystems , such as butterflies , have been dying at much higher rates than usual when farmers grow gm crops in their fields .
while some demonstrators were concerned about the possible health hazards and / or effects to human genetic material , others saw the spread of gm corn in another light , namely the light of bright money .
" many people concentrate on the food aspect , " said christoph asseuer .
" i 'd rather concentrate on the fact of a monopoly that a certain corporation holds on the seeds -lrb- ... -rrb-

the boards of the two companies decided that adidas would purchase the outstanding reebok shares for $ 59 -lrb- 48 euros -rrb- a piece , a premium of 34.2 percent over the closing price of reebok shares had on tuesday evening . the deal is yet to be approved by reebok shareholders and anti-trust authorities , and is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2006 . increased market presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a good year for adidas executive board director herbert hainer the complementary strengths of the two brands in different geographic locations and consumer segments will provide a significant opportunity for value growth . we will gain an unprecedented presence on the market , " said adidas executive board director , herbert hainer . reebok has a particularly strong presence on the us market with nfl -lrb- national football association -rrb- and nba -lrb- national basketball association -rrb- , whereas adidas ' traditional strongholds are the world soccer body fifa , olympic games and european soccer champions league . reebok chairman paul fireman , who holds 17 percent of the sports-shoe maker along with his wife phyllis , has already signalled he would sell his shares . " adidas is the perfect partner for reebok .
the transaction provides our shareholders with good value for their shares and our employees with an opportunity for an even more exciting future , " fireman said . catching up with nike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sense of history : the adidas shoe museum in the bavarian town of scheinfeld adidas is the world 's second largest producer of sportswear .
its earnings raced ahead in the second quarter , boosted by strong demand for its running shoes . adidas booked net profit of 67 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- in the period from april to june , up 48.5 percent from the year-earlier figure .
operating profit was up 24.6 percent at 153 million euros and sales rose by 8.2 percent to 1.516 billion euros . " the first six months of 2005 were important for adidas-salomon , " heiner said .
" we have made our business essentially stronger and more efficient . " in may , the german group announced it had agreed to sell its french subsidiary salomon to finnish firm amer sports corporation for around 485 million euros .
salomon specializes in winter sports , alpine and cross-country skis , snowboards and inline skates . salomon will change owners in september . with the purchase of reebok , adidas will close the distance with its arch-enemy and world leader nike .
according to expert estimates , nike currently dominates around 30 percent of the world market .
adidas and reebok put together will control around 20 percent . world cup fever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa world cup in germany 2006 is expected to drive additional sales for adidas although no international sporting events on the scale of the olympic games are planned in 2005 that could serve as sales catalysts , the sport industry , and adidas , in particular , is counting on the fifa world cup , which will take place in germany in 2006 , to drive sales in the second half of this year as well . worldwide market potential for the soccer business is estimated to 2.6 billion euros in 2005 and is expected to rise to 3 billion euros in 2006 . investors were initially taken by surprise by adidas ' announcement it was taking over reebok .
adidas shares hit an intra-day low of 141.50 euros early in the session , down 4.0 percent on the day . soon , however , investors began to warm up to the idea and were also cheered by the better-than-expected second-quarter results .
in late morning trading , adidas shares had come off their lows to show a loss of just 0.24 percent at 147.16 euros . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma battling to tear stripe off adidas all 's fair in love , war ... and the sportswear market , apparently .

the boards of the two companies decided that adidas would purchase the outstanding reebok shares for $ 59 -lrb- 48 euros -rrb- a piece , a premium of 34.2 percent over the closing price of reebok shares had on tuesday evening . the deal is yet to be approved by reebok shareholders and anti-trust authorities , and is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2006 . increased market presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a good year for adidas executive board director herbert hainer the complementary strengths of the two brands in different geographic locations and consumer segments will provide a significant opportunity for value growth . we will gain an unprecedented presence on the market , " said adidas executive board director , herbert hainer . reebok has a particularly strong presence on the us market with nfl -lrb- national football association -rrb- and nba -lrb- national basketball association -rrb- , whereas adidas ' traditional strongholds are the world soccer body fifa , olympic games and european soccer champions league . reebok chairman paul fireman , who holds 17 percent of the sports-shoe maker along with his wife phyllis , has already signalled he would sell his shares . " adidas is the perfect partner for reebok .
the transaction provides our shareholders with good value for their shares and our employees with an opportunity for an even more exciting future , " fireman said . catching up with nike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sense of history : the adidas shoe museum in the bavarian town of scheinfeld adidas is the world 's second largest producer of sportswear .
its earnings raced ahead in the second quarter , boosted by strong demand for its running shoes . adidas booked net profit of 67 million euros -lrb- $ 82 million -rrb- in the period from april to june , up 48.5 percent from the year-earlier figure .
operating profit was up 24.6 percent at 153 million euros and sales rose by 8.2 percent to 1.516 billion euros . " the first six months of 2005 were important for adidas-salomon , " heiner said .
" we have made our business essentially stronger and more efficient . " in may , the german group announced it had agreed to sell its french subsidiary salomon to finnish firm amer sports corporation for around 485 million euros .
salomon specializes in winter sports , alpine and cross-country skis , snowboards and inline skates . salomon will change owners in september . with the purchase of reebok , adidas will close the distance with its arch-enemy and world leader nike .
according to expert estimates , nike currently dominates around 30 percent of the world market .
adidas and reebok put together will control around 20 percent . world cup fever bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa world cup in germany 2006 is expected to drive additional sales for adidas although no international sporting events on the scale of the olympic games are planned in 2005 that could serve as sales catalysts , the sport industry , and adidas , in particular , is counting on the fifa world cup , which will take place in germany in 2006 , to drive sales in the second half of this year as well . worldwide market potential for the soccer business is estimated to 2.6 billion euros in 2005 and is expected to rise to 3 billion euros in 2006 . investors were initially taken by surprise by adidas ' announcement it was taking over reebok .
adidas shares hit an intra-day low of 141.50 euros early in the session , down 4.0 percent on the day . soon , however , investors began to warm up to the idea and were also cheered by the better-than-expected second-quarter results .
in late morning trading , adidas shares had come off their lows to show a loss of just 0.24 percent at 147.16 euros . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma battling to tear stripe off adidas all 's fair in love , war ... and the sportswear market , apparently .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .
now only a third of the population is of this opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt the majority of elderly people are in good health and want to contribute to social wealth for much longer .
given the current era of high unemployment , this is sometimes being perceived by many as a threat , said social democrat family minister renate schmidt in berlin on wednesday . " this demographic development is still being viewed here as a menace , " she said .
" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise . " employers need to change ageist attitudes schmidt said employers would have to change their current reservations towards employing elderly people in their 50s and 60s , as germany ’ s ageing society could not afford to do without them .
she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added . " and this will be particularly important for the younger generation now , who might still hear from their grandfathers and grandmothers that they are able to live well on their statutory pensions alone .
private pension insurance will play a pivotal role in avoiding an increase in old-age poverty in germany . ” schmidt praises caring elderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister praised the pensioners ’ share in looking after the young generation , while their parents are at work .
family ties , she said , were still very close in germany despite fact that the concept of living together under one roof was an exception rather than the rule . she said that pensioners were also playing a huge role in supporting children financially with a third of all elderly people polled in the study having shelled out no fewer than 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.6 billion -rrb- between 1996 and 2002 alone . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a second bite of the employment cherry retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .

his junior defence minister at the time , holger pfahls , 62 , had no influence on the deal , the former chancellor said , effectively clearing pfahls of bribery charges . kohl said that he promised former us secretary of state james baker in 1990 that germany would export tanks to saudi arabia .
during the first gulf war , he gave the us all manner of financial and material support in order to prevent sending german troops over to fight , kohl said . he added that he never understood why pfahls would have received any payment in connection with the deal . " the saudis knew that they 'd get their tanks , " kohl said .
" it was clear to everyone that i would honor my promise . " kohl stressed that his government had never been open to bribes . " i have no indication of outside influences , " kohl said .

" tax evasion charges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german state secretary of defense , ludwig holger pfahls pfahls , who is being tried on corruption and tax fraud charges , has admitted taking around 511,000 euros -lrb- $ 630,000 -rrb- from arms dealer karlheinz schreiber in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , but says he did nothing in return .
he has also admitted to pocketing about a million euros over an 820-million-euro deal to sell armored vehicles to the united states the previous year . according to the charges against him , he failed to declare to tax authorities a " corruption salary " paid into a swiss bank . the presiding judge said at the start of the trial that pfahls could face a relatively lenient sentence of two years and three months in prison if he delivered a full confession .
a verdict is expected on aug.11. no new evidence on cdu scandal kohl 's testimony was eagerly awaited in germany , as the former leader 's own reputation was badly damaged in 1999 when it emerged his cdu party had been involved in receiving illegal donations through a secret slush fund . kohl swore never to reveal the names of the donors , though german police suspect that schreiber was among them .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .

" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise .

she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .
now only a third of the population is of this opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt the majority of elderly people are in good health and want to contribute to social wealth for much longer .
given the current era of high unemployment , this is sometimes being perceived by many as a threat , said social democrat family minister renate schmidt in berlin on wednesday . " this demographic development is still being viewed here as a menace , " she said .
" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise . " employers need to change ageist attitudes schmidt said employers would have to change their current reservations towards employing elderly people in their 50s and 60s , as germany ’ s ageing society could not afford to do without them .
she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added . " and this will be particularly important for the younger generation now , who might still hear from their grandfathers and grandmothers that they are able to live well on their statutory pensions alone .
private pension insurance will play a pivotal role in avoiding an increase in old-age poverty in germany . ” schmidt praises caring elderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister praised the pensioners ’ share in looking after the young generation , while their parents are at work .
family ties , she said , were still very close in germany despite fact that the concept of living together under one roof was an exception rather than the rule . she said that pensioners were also playing a huge role in supporting children financially with a third of all elderly people polled in the study having shelled out no fewer than 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.6 billion -rrb- between 1996 and 2002 alone . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a second bite of the employment cherry retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .
former chancellor helmut kohl always refused in the belief that the encounters would merely raise the profile of his challenger . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany braces for election tv duel while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .

" i hear that ms -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel is of another opinion but i have my doubts , " schröder told the daily neue presse in his hometown of hanover .
schröder , who campaigned against the us-led invasion , said he was convinced that if his opponent in the 2002 election edmund stoiber had won , german soldiers would now be fighting in iraq .
the german leader 's outspoken opposition to the iraq war - six months before it began - was widely credited with giving him the crucial boost to win a tight re-election race .
schröder has attempted to bridge the rift with washington over his strident stance against the war by committing germany to training iraqi security forces in the neighboring united arab emirates .
although merkel 's christian democratic union has a double-digit lead in the polls , a survey published last month in der spiegel news weekly found that two-thirds of voters do not trust her promise not to send troops to iraq .

" i hear that ms -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel is of another opinion but i have my doubts , " schröder told the daily neue presse in his hometown of hanover .
schröder , who campaigned against the us-led invasion , said he was convinced that if his opponent in the 2002 election edmund stoiber had won , german soldiers would now be fighting in iraq .
the german leader 's outspoken opposition to the iraq war - six months before it began - was widely credited with giving him the crucial boost to win a tight re-election race .
schröder has attempted to bridge the rift with washington over his strident stance against the war by committing germany to training iraqi security forces in the neighboring united arab emirates .
although merkel 's christian democratic union has a double-digit lead in the polls , a survey published last month in der spiegel news weekly found that two-thirds of voters do not trust her promise not to send troops to iraq .
schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have plummeted in popularity over their economic and job market policies , have attempted to put an accent on foreign and security policy issues in the campaign for the september 18 election . dw-world.de schröder to play the iraq card again ?
although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 .

" in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung , schily said , referring to islamic extremists , that there were known menaces in germany who could not be deported because they faced the death penalty in their home country or because they had become german subjects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister otto schily " however , if you know for certain they 're dangerous , but do n't have any concrete evidence of a criminal act , is it completely unimaginable to hold them in custody for a certain period to ward off danger and for public safety ? "
schily said . " we need to think about it " the interior minister added that he was aware of the fact that there is no majority currently for introducing preventative custody , but that it was necessary to start a " theoretical debate " about the issue . " we need to think about it , " he said . another important preventative measure against terrorism was integration and assimilation of foreigners , schily said in the interview . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration and assimilation of foreigners in germany will make the country safer , german interior minister otto schily said .
" assimilation is not the same thing as denying oneself , " he said .
" mustafa will still be called mustafa and go to a mosque . " but he said that the more germany successfully encouraged immigrants to adopt german values , the more immunity against terrorist propaganda would increase . germany is not the first european government to mull the prospect of preventative custody .

a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .
18 .
eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .
lawmakers in france have proposed a similar law , while the czech senate recently voted down legislation banning smoking in public buildings . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to ban tobacco ads germany will ban tobacco advertising in the press , on the internet and at sporting events in line with a european union directive , the german government said on wednesday . -lrb- may 18 , 2005 -rrb- germans agree to curb smoking moving to protect non-smokers in germany , the federal government and the country 's association of hotels and restaurants have signed an agreement which obliges owners to create non-smoking sections for their customers .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.08.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc possible insider trading at daimlerchrysler german financial watchdog , bafin , has launched a probe into possible insider trading in shares in german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler in the wake of the shock announcement last week that chairman jürgen schrempp was to step down early , a spokeswoman said wednesday .
the bafin spokeswoman insisted that the investigation was routine and one that the watchdog always launched in such cases .

a law proposed by the government is not likely to make it past the upper house dominated by opposition parties . the passing of the deadline to implement a european directive banning tobacco advertising has rekindled the debate on the issue in germany .
brussels required eu member states to pass national legislation by the end of july that prohibits advertising for tobacco products in the print and broadcast media as well as the internet . however , in germany the prohibition appears far from becoming law .
on monday , the head of the parliamentary committee for consumer protection , hertha däubler-gmelin -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized the christian democratic opposition party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for threatening to vote against a government initiative to implement the directive in the bundesrat - the upper house representing the interests of the federal states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social democratic-led federal government had originally presented the law in mid-may .
but , on july 8 , the cdu-dominated bundesrat issued a statement rejecting the proposed advertising ban .
opposition to the proposal from the bundesrat could theoretically be overruled by the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , though that can not happen until the reconstituted body convenes after the general election on sept .

eu-directive interferes with national legislation former justice minister däubler-gmelin charged that the " blockade politics in the bundesrat " by the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , undermines the protection of non-smokers .
she suggested that in sticking to their opposition to the law the union parties yield to pressure from lobby groups and business .
the cdu defended their stance , saying that legislation on health issues is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the eu-member states .
while in favor of strenghtening measures to protect non-smokers , " the issue has to be decided on in germany alone , " the head of the cdu group in the european parliament , hartmut nassauer , said on monday .
legal action against brussels meanwhile , the government has filed a suit against the directive at the european court of justice in luxembourg on purely legal grounds , däubler-gmelin said .
while supporting a ban on tobacco advertising in principle , any health-related legislation - including an advertising ban - remains within the jurisdiction of the individual member states , she added , echoing statements by the cdu .
for similar reasons germany successfully sued against a previous directive banning tobacco advertising in 2000 .
however , while legal action against the directive is under way , its implementation on the national level can not be put off .
advertising ban curbs smoking the european union agreed on the directive in may 2003 to cut down on smoking and its ill effects burdening the health budgets of its member states . an advertising ban " is one of the most effective means to reduce smoking , " eu health commissioner markos kyprianou said .
most member states have already turned the policy guideline from brussels into national law . some including italy , irland and sweden , have gone even further and introduced a general ban on smoking in all public spaces .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .
now only a third of the population is of this opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt the majority of elderly people are in good health and want to contribute to social wealth for much longer .
given the current era of high unemployment , this is sometimes being perceived by many as a threat , said social democrat family minister renate schmidt in berlin on wednesday . " this demographic development is still being viewed here as a menace , " she said .
" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise . " employers need to change ageist attitudes schmidt said employers would have to change their current reservations towards employing elderly people in their 50s and 60s , as germany ’ s ageing society could not afford to do without them .
she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added . " and this will be particularly important for the younger generation now , who might still hear from their grandfathers and grandmothers that they are able to live well on their statutory pensions alone .
private pension insurance will play a pivotal role in avoiding an increase in old-age poverty in germany . ” schmidt praises caring elderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister praised the pensioners ’ share in looking after the young generation , while their parents are at work .
family ties , she said , were still very close in germany despite fact that the concept of living together under one roof was an exception rather than the rule . she said that pensioners were also playing a huge role in supporting children financially with a third of all elderly people polled in the study having shelled out no fewer than 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.6 billion -rrb- between 1996 and 2002 alone . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a second bite of the employment cherry retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth .

august 2005 .
die leichen seien am sonntag , 31 .

die kinder seien vermutlich zwischen 1988 und 2004 geboren und unmittelbar nach der geburt getoetet worden , erklaerte ein polizeisprecher .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- outside view of a house in brieskow-finkenheerd , south of frankfurt-oder in the german state brandenburg where police discovered the remains of nine newborn babies buried in the garden near the garage and arrested a woman believed to be the children 's mother , prosecutors said monday aug .
1 , 2005 .
the bodies were found sunday in brieskow-finkenheerd , a village near the polish border , after police received a tip-off , said michael neff , a spokesman for prosecutors in nearby frankfurt an der oder .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- a police spokesman in the city of frankfurt an der oder on the polish border , where the 39-year-old suspect identified as sabine h. lived , said they were focusing in particular on an apartment in the nearby city of eisenhüttenstadt .
he said the aim of the new searches was to rule out other victims . the public prosecutor 's office said the 39-year-old mother was still being questioned after telling investigators she had only hazy memories of giving birth to the children while heavily intoxicated between 1988 and 1999 and leaving at least one to die under a blanket . sabine h. said she stored the corpses in flower boxes and pots on her balcony before depositing them in a family shed .
she said that all the children were fathered by her estranged husband , whom she finally divorced in may . pathologists were still trying to determine the infants ' cause of death .
authorities had initially said the births had taken place over a 16-year period but new findings from the mothers ' interrogation revealed a nearly unbroken cycle of pregnancies and deaths .
investigators were also speaking with friends and relatives of the suspect , who is also the mother of four living children . an acquaintance discovered small human bones in an old aquarium sunday after being asked to clear out a shed belonging to the family .
he alerted police , who then uncovered the remains of eight other babies hidden in flower boxes and pots in the shed and in buckets buried under sand and earth . comments on crime rile east german politicians brandenburg state interior minister jörg schönbohm blamed the legacy of communist east germany and a " forced proletarianization , " saying it had broken down societal structures leading citizens to turn a blind eye to violence and suffering . " this unbelievable indifference is what strikes me the most , " schönbohm said in an interview in wednesday 's berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" i can not understand how no one saw that this woman was in a critical situation and needed help .
what were the parents doing , the neighbors ? " the remarks met with criticism by some eastern german politicians , with eckhardt rehberg in the neighboring state of mecklenburg-western pommerania warning against a " one-sided judgment against the actions of an entire population " . the chairman of the new left party , lothar bisky , said such comments reflected outdated cold war rhetoric and noted west germany also had its share of serious crimes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mother of dead babies ca n't recall killings the woman suspected of killing nine newborn babies found buried in eastern germany confirmed on tuesday that they were her children but can not recall how they were killed , officials said at a press conference .

august 2005 .
die leichen seien am sonntag , 31 .

die kinder seien vermutlich zwischen 1988 und 2004 geboren und unmittelbar nach der geburt getoetet worden , erklaerte ein polizeisprecher .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- outside view of a house in brieskow-finkenheerd , south of frankfurt-oder in the german state brandenburg where police discovered the remains of nine newborn babies buried in the garden near the garage and arrested a woman believed to be the children 's mother , prosecutors said monday aug .
1 , 2005 .
the bodies were found sunday in brieskow-finkenheerd , a village near the polish border , after police received a tip-off , said michael neff , a spokesman for prosecutors in nearby frankfurt an der oder .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- a police spokesman in the city of frankfurt an der oder on the polish border , where the 39-year-old suspect identified as sabine h. lived , said they were focusing in particular on an apartment in the nearby city of eisenhüttenstadt .
he said the aim of the new searches was to rule out other victims . the public prosecutor 's office said the 39-year-old mother was still being questioned after telling investigators she had only hazy memories of giving birth to the children while heavily intoxicated between 1988 and 1999 and leaving at least one to die under a blanket . sabine h. said she stored the corpses in flower boxes and pots on her balcony before depositing them in a family shed .
she said that all the children were fathered by her estranged husband , whom she finally divorced in may . pathologists were still trying to determine the infants ' cause of death .
authorities had initially said the births had taken place over a 16-year period but new findings from the mothers ' interrogation revealed a nearly unbroken cycle of pregnancies and deaths .
investigators were also speaking with friends and relatives of the suspect , who is also the mother of four living children . an acquaintance discovered small human bones in an old aquarium sunday after being asked to clear out a shed belonging to the family .
he alerted police , who then uncovered the remains of eight other babies hidden in flower boxes and pots in the shed and in buckets buried under sand and earth . comments on crime rile east german politicians brandenburg state interior minister jörg schönbohm blamed the legacy of communist east germany and a " forced proletarianization , " saying it had broken down societal structures leading citizens to turn a blind eye to violence and suffering . " this unbelievable indifference is what strikes me the most , " schönbohm said in an interview in wednesday 's berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" i can not understand how no one saw that this woman was in a critical situation and needed help .
what were the parents doing , the neighbors ? " the remarks met with criticism by some eastern german politicians , with eckhardt rehberg in the neighboring state of mecklenburg-western pommerania warning against a " one-sided judgment against the actions of an entire population " . the chairman of the new left party , lothar bisky , said such comments reflected outdated cold war rhetoric and noted west germany also had its share of serious crimes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mother of dead babies ca n't recall killings the woman suspected of killing nine newborn babies found buried in eastern germany confirmed on tuesday that they were her children but can not recall how they were killed , officials said at a press conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : graying germany germany 's graying gangsters german models come of age growing old gracefully in germany german seniors say no to nursing homes germany -pipe- 03.08.2005 germans willing to work past retirement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans want to sit back once they reach retirement age only a minority of elderly people in germany are satisfied with saying goodbye to their working environment at the age of 60 , says a study presented on monday by the german minister for family affairs , renate schmidt . women in germany now reach the ripe old age of 80 average and men 78 years .
with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .
now only a third of the population is of this opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt the majority of elderly people are in good health and want to contribute to social wealth for much longer .
given the current era of high unemployment , this is sometimes being perceived by many as a threat , said social democrat family minister renate schmidt in berlin on wednesday . " this demographic development is still being viewed here as a menace , " she said .
" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise . " employers need to change ageist attitudes schmidt said employers would have to change their current reservations towards employing elderly people in their 50s and 60s , as germany ’ s ageing society could not afford to do without them .
she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added . " and this will be particularly important for the younger generation now , who might still hear from their grandfathers and grandmothers that they are able to live well on their statutory pensions alone .
private pension insurance will play a pivotal role in avoiding an increase in old-age poverty in germany . ” schmidt praises caring elderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister praised the pensioners ’ share in looking after the young generation , while their parents are at work .
family ties , she said , were still very close in germany despite fact that the concept of living together under one roof was an exception rather than the rule . she said that pensioners were also playing a huge role in supporting children financially with a third of all elderly people polled in the study having shelled out no fewer than 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.6 billion -rrb- between 1996 and 2002 alone . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a second bite of the employment cherry retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .
now only a third of the population is of this opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt the majority of elderly people are in good health and want to contribute to social wealth for much longer .
given the current era of high unemployment , this is sometimes being perceived by many as a threat , said social democrat family minister renate schmidt in berlin on wednesday . " this demographic development is still being viewed here as a menace , " she said .
" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise . " employers need to change ageist attitudes schmidt said employers would have to change their current reservations towards employing elderly people in their 50s and 60s , as germany ’ s ageing society could not afford to do without them .
she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added . " and this will be particularly important for the younger generation now , who might still hear from their grandfathers and grandmothers that they are able to live well on their statutory pensions alone .
private pension insurance will play a pivotal role in avoiding an increase in old-age poverty in germany . ” schmidt praises caring elderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister praised the pensioners ’ share in looking after the young generation , while their parents are at work .
family ties , she said , were still very close in germany despite fact that the concept of living together under one roof was an exception rather than the rule . she said that pensioners were also playing a huge role in supporting children financially with a third of all elderly people polled in the study having shelled out no fewer than 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.6 billion -rrb- between 1996 and 2002 alone . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a second bite of the employment cherry retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth .

august 2005 .

1 , 2005 .
the bodies were found sunday in brieskow-finkenheerd , a village near the polish border , after police received a tip-off , said michael neff , a spokesman for prosecutors in nearby frankfurt an der oder .
-lrb- ap photo / markus schreiber -rrb- a police spokesman in the city of frankfurt an der oder on the polish border , where the 39-year-old suspect identified as sabine h. lived , said they were focusing in particular on an apartment in the nearby city of eisenhüttenstadt .
he said the aim of the new searches was to rule out other victims . the public prosecutor 's office said the 39-year-old mother was still being questioned after telling investigators she had only hazy memories of giving birth to the children while heavily intoxicated between 1988 and 1999 and leaving at least one to die under a blanket . sabine h. said she stored the corpses in flower boxes and pots on her balcony before depositing them in a family shed .
she said that all the children were fathered by her estranged husband , whom she finally divorced in may . pathologists were still trying to determine the infants ' cause of death .
authorities had initially said the births had taken place over a 16-year period but new findings from the mothers ' interrogation revealed a nearly unbroken cycle of pregnancies and deaths .
investigators were also speaking with friends and relatives of the suspect , who is also the mother of four living children . an acquaintance discovered small human bones in an old aquarium sunday after being asked to clear out a shed belonging to the family .
he alerted police , who then uncovered the remains of eight other babies hidden in flower boxes and pots in the shed and in buckets buried under sand and earth . comments on crime rile east german politicians brandenburg state interior minister jörg schönbohm blamed the legacy of communist east germany and a " forced proletarianization , " saying it had broken down societal structures leading citizens to turn a blind eye to violence and suffering . " this unbelievable indifference is what strikes me the most , " schönbohm said in an interview in wednesday 's berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" i can not understand how no one saw that this woman was in a critical situation and needed help .
what were the parents doing , the neighbors ? " the remarks met with criticism by some eastern german politicians , with eckhardt rehberg in the neighboring state of mecklenburg-western pommerania warning against a " one-sided judgment against the actions of an entire population " . the chairman of the new left party , lothar bisky , said such comments reflected outdated cold war rhetoric and noted west germany also had its share of serious crimes . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mother of dead babies ca n't recall killings the woman suspected of killing nine newborn babies found buried in eastern germany confirmed on tuesday that they were her children but can not recall how they were killed , officials said at a press conference .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .

it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 03.08.2005 political heavyweights eye one-round bout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloves are off : schröder gets one chance to k.o. rival merkel german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will face each other in a single televised debate on september 4 .
it is likely to be essential viewing . the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has until september 4 to prime chancellor candidate angela merkel for a one-off television duel with her more media-savvy opponent gerhard schröder .
there will be no chance for merkel to take revenge if her debate with the incumbent chancellor goes badly as there will be just one live debate between the two candidates in the run- up to the federal election , likely to be held on september 18 . the decision to limit the heavyweight clash to the single bout was announced by schröder 's social democrats on wednesday after much deliberation .
the 90-minute debate will go out live on sept .
4 at 20:30 cet and will be broadcast on german channels ard , zdf , rtl and sat.1 / pro7 simultaneously . media savvy schröder will have to go for the kill bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision is likely to favor and please schröder despite the fact he originally demanded two duels .
the one-off will be a winner-takes-all clash which the chancellor will no doubt use to show off his slick debating skills in a bid to boost his poll ratings .
schröder staged a comeback to win the 2002 election after a television duel in which he outshone his rival that year , the conservative edmund stoiber . however , surveys in 2002 showed that stoiber was the narrow winner of their first debate but was soundly beaten by the chancellor in a second duel two weeks before the actual vote , in which he aggressively defended his decision not to send german troops to iraq .
viewers said schröder came across as the more competent , credible and likeable candidate . awkward angie gets one chance but angela merkel is a different political animal from edmund stoiber .
the single bout debate will have merkel 's advisors nervously thumbing the yellow pages for a media image consultant who can be quickly hired to whip the often awkward cdu leader into shape for her face-off with the affable tv personality that is schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel , a former scientist , has revamped her dowdy image of late but often looks uncomfortable in front of the camera and nervous at times when speaking . schröder and his people have obviously picked up on her weaknesses .
recently , the chancellor challenged his rival to agree looser ground rules for the potentially crucial television debate .
he is in favor of adding more cut-and-thrust by scrapping some of the restrictions on speaking time that governed his 2002 encounters with stoiber , a government spokesman said . " more flexibility would be desirable , " the spokesman told a regular government news briefing last week .
" it often came across to the viewer as a tight corset , " he added of the 2002 debates , in which the candidates had to limit replies to 90 , 60 or 30 seconds according to strict rules . merkel could channel everything into one big win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the chancellor 's obviously relaxed attitude to being on television , it has been merkel 's camp which has been pushing for the one-off show .
while it may be that merkel has just one chance to get it right , it also means that she also has only one chance to get it wrong .
with the right preparation , merkel could put her all into fighting her corner during the single debate . this could also mean that the threat of a second bout - which could provide schröder with a chance to cement a televised drubbing if he were to come out on top in the first - would be removed leaving the cdu chief more relaxed . embattled schröder knows winner takes all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate is beginning to look ever more important with schröder 's center-left social democrats floundering in a recent poll with just 27 percent of the vote , broadly unchanged and 17 points behind merkel 's cdu .
the chancellor may be tempted to unleash his whole media arsenal in the one-off debate , one which merkel will have to counter to remain in the lead in the polls .
it could make potentially essential viewing . the 61-year-old leader is the first incumbent german chancellor to meet his opponents in head-on tv debates .

his junior defence minister at the time , holger pfahls , 62 , had no influence on the deal , the former chancellor said , effectively clearing pfahls of bribery charges . kohl said that he promised former us secretary of state james baker in 1990 that germany would export tanks to saudi arabia .
during the first gulf war , he gave the us all manner of financial and material support in order to prevent sending german troops over to fight , kohl said . he added that he never understood why pfahls would have received any payment in connection with the deal . " the saudis knew that they 'd get their tanks , " kohl said .
" it was clear to everyone that i would honor my promise . " kohl stressed that his government had never been open to bribes . " i have no indication of outside influences , " kohl said .
" i was never bribeable and never will be . " tax evasion charges remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german state secretary of defense , ludwig holger pfahls pfahls , who is being tried on corruption and tax fraud charges , has admitted taking around 511,000 euros -lrb- $ 630,000 -rrb- from arms dealer karlheinz schreiber in connection with the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia , but says he did nothing in return .
he has also admitted to pocketing about a million euros over an 820-million-euro deal to sell armored vehicles to the united states the previous year . according to the charges against him , he failed to declare to tax authorities a " corruption salary " paid into a swiss bank . the presiding judge said at the start of the trial that pfahls could face a relatively lenient sentence of two years and three months in prison if he delivered a full confession .
a verdict is expected on aug.11. no new evidence on cdu scandal kohl 's testimony was eagerly awaited in germany , as the former leader 's own reputation was badly damaged in 1999 when it emerged his cdu party had been involved in receiving illegal donations through a secret slush fund . kohl swore never to reveal the names of the donors , though german police suspect that schreiber was among them .
kohl has kept his promise , despite hopes that the pfahls trial might shed more light on the cdu funding scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politically charged trial takes sudden twist a the start of his trial on separate tax evasion and corruption charges over an arms deal with saudi arabia , former german junior defense minister ludwig-holger pfahls admitted in court tuesday to accepting bribes .

with fewer and fewer babies being born , the german society ’ s ageing process is expected to accelerate even further in the next few decades . an eight-year study by the german center for old-age issues commissioned by the family ministry shows that elderly people will consequently play an even bigger role in both the family and working life . back in 1996 , when the last such study was conducted , about 50 percent of germans could not imagine continuing to work beyond the age of 60 .
now only a third of the population is of this opinion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate schmidt the majority of elderly people are in good health and want to contribute to social wealth for much longer .
given the current era of high unemployment , this is sometimes being perceived by many as a threat , said social democrat family minister renate schmidt in berlin on wednesday . " this demographic development is still being viewed here as a menace , " she said .
" i ’ m not denying that it ’ s a great challenge for society to cope with the consequences , but first and foremost it entails a lot of opportunities as we deal with people with valuable experience and expertise . " employers need to change ageist attitudes schmidt said employers would have to change their current reservations towards employing elderly people in their 50s and 60s , as germany ’ s ageing society could not afford to do without them .
she spoke of the government ’ s current efforts to lay on special programs with a view to making it easier for elderly mean and women to find employment again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmidt acknowledged that the way the demographic pyramid was expected to change over the next decades would make it increasingly impossible for the statutory pension system to be playing the same role it was still having for present-day pensioners . “ we surely have to tell people time and again that the statutory pension system can not shoulder the whole burden of securing old-age living standards any more , " she said . " people need to become more aware of the fact that additional private savings schemes are required to enable them to live without financial worries , " schmidt added . " and this will be particularly important for the younger generation now , who might still hear from their grandfathers and grandmothers that they are able to live well on their statutory pensions alone .
private pension insurance will play a pivotal role in avoiding an increase in old-age poverty in germany . ” schmidt praises caring elderly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family minister praised the pensioners ’ share in looking after the young generation , while their parents are at work .
family ties , she said , were still very close in germany despite fact that the concept of living together under one roof was an exception rather than the rule . she said that pensioners were also playing a huge role in supporting children financially with a third of all elderly people polled in the study having shelled out no fewer than 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 40.6 billion -rrb- between 1996 and 2002 alone . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a second bite of the employment cherry retired professionals in germany are turning their backs on allotments and organized bus tours to return to the jobs they loved as volunteers in some of the remotest places on earth .

anthony 's older sister , dominique , fought back tears as she issued a public appeal for help in catching her brother 's killers .
she said : " i just want to say to the people that if anybody knows anything can they speak up .
" this is no joke , he is flesh and blood , my little brother , he was only 18 .
" it is not over , you just do n't know , you just do n't know what you have done . "
earlier , at the scene of anthony 's death , the mother of murdered black teenager stephen lawrence said she hoped his family would have justice .

" you must do this because you know it 's right . "
doreen lawrence said she hoped anthony 's family would get justice he said the murder was " horrific " and " senseless " , adding those responsible " must be brought to justice " .
a 29-year-old man arrested in connection with the axe attack had been released on police bail and a 17-year-old , who was also being questioned , had earlier been released on police bail .
a 26-year-old man remains in custody .

mitchell 's solicitor nigel beaumont confirmed the move , which came six months after the 17-year-old was found guilty of killing his girlfriend .
judges sitting in private will consider the case submitted by mitchell 's legal team led by donald findlay qc .
mitchell was ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years for the murder .
he had denied killing jodi in june 2003 , but was found guilty after a 42-day trial at the high court in edinburgh .
mr findlay told the court : " so long as that young man maintains to me he did not kill jodi the fight to clear his name will go on . "
" convinced as i am of my client 's innocence , i hope it will be overturned " nigel beaumont mr beaumont did not go into the detail of the grounds for appeal but said they hoped to apply for bail at some stage in the process .
" it was always intimated that our client was going to appeal , " he said , " and we lodged that appeal against conviction and sentence on the grounds it was unfair .
" the next stage is that judges will consider the note of appeal .
they could reject it sitting in private but hopefully they will pass it over for a public hearing . "
principle options mr beaumont said there were three main possibilities ; there could be a retrial , the conviction and sentence could be set aside or it could be sustained .
" convinced as i am of my client 's innocence , i hope it will be overturned , " he added .
jodi , 14 , was stripped , tied up and stabbed to death in woods near her dalkeith home .
the judge described it as the worst murder case he had ever seen .
the trial heard that mitchell , a heavy cannabis user , was obsessed with the cult icon marilyn manson .

mitchell 's solicitor nigel beaumont confirmed the move , which came six months after the 17-year-old was found guilty of killing his girlfriend .
judges sitting in private will consider the case submitted by mitchell 's legal team led by donald findlay qc .
mitchell was ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years for the murder .
he had denied killing jodi in june 2003 , but was found guilty after a 42-day trial at the high court in edinburgh .
mr findlay told the court : " so long as that young man maintains to me he did not kill jodi the fight to clear his name will go on . "
convinced as i am of my client 's innocence , i hope it will be overturned nigel beaumont mr beaumont did not go into the detail of the grounds for appeal but said they hoped to apply for bail at some stage in the process .
" it was always intimated that our client was going to appeal , " he said , " and we lodged that appeal against conviction and sentence on the grounds it was unfair .
" the next stage is that judges will consider the note of appeal .
they could reject it sitting in private but hopefully they will pass it over for a public hearing . "
principle options mr beaumont said there were three main possibilities ; there could be a retrial , the conviction and sentence could be set aside or it could be sustained .
" convinced as i am of my client 's innocence , i hope it will be overturned , " he added .
jodi , 14 , was stripped , tied up and stabbed to death in woods near her dalkeith home .
the judge described it as the worst murder case he had ever seen .

she had worked in belfast city hospital during the troubles of the 1970s , but must have thought she had escaped the random killing of such attacks when she moved to england .
" most people know someone that was killed in the troubles , " her husband , sean , said in light of their son 's death .
" but you do n't expect it to happen in london . "
twenty-two-year-old ciaran cassidy , who was on his way to work on the morning of the london attacks , had an eye for the pleasures in life .
" he did n't care for politics or war , " said his close friend joe hayes at mr cassidy 's funeral , " but for his family , his friends , for his football and his weekend drink . "
' happy-go-lucky ' those sentiments were echoed by his father .
" we will remember him as a happy-go-lucky boy who enjoyed life and lived for his weekends and going out with friends . "
" i have been moved by the number of people that have come in off the street , and who knew ciaran , to offer their condolences " mike harris as he travelled to work on the morning of 7 july his thoughts , perhaps , were on his planned trip to australia .
he had been saving for several months , salting away money earned from his job as a shop assistant for a printing company in chancery lane .
or maybe he was mulling the prospects for his beloved arsenal football club in the forthcoming season .
as a child he dreamed of playing for the team and was often at highbury to cheer them on a saturday afternoon .
sean cassidy had moved to the uk from rural ireland at a time when work was short in the republic , and married veronica , a nurse , from enniskillen in northern ireland .
' great worker ' ciaran was born in october 1982 and brought up in the close-knit religious family in finsbury park , north london , along with his older sister lisa .
he attended the nearby christ the king roman catholic primary school in islington and st thomas more roman catholic secondary school in wood green , before completing his education at la swap sixth-form college in highgate .
" ciaran was a great worker , " his boss mike harris told the islington gazette .
" he is sadly missed and i have been moved by the number of people that have come in off the street , and who knew ciaran , to offer their condolences . "

she had worked in belfast city hospital during the troubles of the 1970s , but must have thought she had escaped the random killing of such attacks when she moved to england .
" most people know someone that was killed in the troubles , " her husband , sean , said in light of their son 's death .
" but you do n't expect it to happen in london . "
twenty-two-year-old ciaran cassidy , who was on his way to work on the morning of the london attacks , had an eye for the pleasures in life .
" he did n't care for politics or war , " said his close friend joe hayes at mr cassidy 's funeral , " but for his family , his friends , for his football and his weekend drink . "
' happy-go-lucky ' those sentiments were echoed by his father .
" we will remember him as a happy-go-lucky boy who enjoyed life and lived for his weekends and going out with friends . "
i have been moved by the number of people that have come in off the street , and who knew ciaran , to offer their condolences mike harris as he travelled to work on the morning of 7 july his thoughts , perhaps , were on his planned trip to australia .
he had been saving for several months , salting away money earned from his job as a shop assistant for a printing company in chancery lane .
or maybe he was mulling the prospects for his beloved arsenal football club in the forthcoming season .
as a child he dreamed of playing for the team and was often at highbury to cheer them on a saturday afternoon .
sean cassidy had moved to the uk from rural ireland at a time when work was short in the republic , and married veronica , a nurse , from enniskillen in northern ireland .
' great worker ' ciaran was born in october 1982 and brought up in the close-knit religious family in finsbury park , north london , along with his older sister lisa .
he attended the nearby christ the king roman catholic primary school in islington and st thomas more roman catholic secondary school in wood green , before completing his education at la swap sixth-form college in highgate .
" ciaran was a great worker , " his boss mike harris told the islington gazette .

she had worked in belfast city hospital during the troubles of the 1970s , but must have thought she had escaped the random killing of such attacks when she moved to england .
" most people know someone that was killed in the troubles , " her husband , sean , said in light of their son 's death .
" but you do n't expect it to happen in london . "
twenty-two-year-old ciaran cassidy , who was on his way to work on the morning of the london attacks , had an eye for the pleasures in life .
" he did n't care for politics or war , " said his close friend joe hayes at mr cassidy 's funeral , " but for his family , his friends , for his football and his weekend drink . "
' happy-go-lucky ' those sentiments were echoed by his father .
" we will remember him as a happy-go-lucky boy who enjoyed life and lived for his weekends and going out with friends . "
i have been moved by the number of people that have come in off the street , and who knew ciaran , to offer their condolences mike harris as he travelled to work on the morning of 7 july his thoughts , perhaps , were on his planned trip to australia .
he had been saving for several months , salting away money earned from his job as a shop assistant for a printing company in chancery lane .
or maybe he was mulling the prospects for his beloved arsenal football club in the forthcoming season .
as a child he dreamed of playing for the team and was often at highbury to cheer them on a saturday afternoon .
sean cassidy had moved to the uk from rural ireland at a time when work was short in the republic , and married veronica , a nurse , from enniskillen in northern ireland .
' great worker ' ciaran was born in october 1982 and brought up in the close-knit religious family in finsbury park , north london , along with his older sister lisa .
he attended the nearby christ the king roman catholic primary school in islington and st thomas more roman catholic secondary school in wood green , before completing his education at la swap sixth-form college in highgate .
" ciaran was a great worker , " his boss mike harris told the islington gazette .
" he is sadly missed and i have been moved by the number of people that have come in off the street , and who knew ciaran , to offer their condolences . "

the organic farms were found to contain 85 % more plant species , 33 % more bats , 17 % more spiders and 5 % more birds .
scientists - from oxford university , the british trust for ornithology , and the centre for ecology and hydrology - spent five years on the research .
funded by the government , it was the largest ever survey of organic farming .
" the exclusion of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers from organic is a fundamental difference between systems , " the study says .
other key differences found on the organic farms included smaller fields , more grasslands and hedges that are taller , thicker and on average 71 % longer .
dr lisa norton , of the centre for ecology & hydrology , said : " hedges are full of native , berry-producing shrubs , which are great for insects and the birds and bats that feed on them . "

the fact the organic arable farms were more likely to have livestock on them also made them richer habitats for wildlife .
the study 's lead author , british trust for ornithology habitat research director dr rob fuller , told bbc news : " there were very large benefits right across the species spectrum . "
the study had looked at a " very , very high " proportion of england 's organic arable farms , he said .
more organic farming would help " restore biodiversity within agricultural landscapes " , dr fuller added .
" less than 3 % of english farmland is organic so there is plenty of scope for an increase in area . "

the study 's lead author , british trust for ornithology habitat research director dr rob fuller , told bbc news : " there were very large benefits right across the species spectrum . "
the study had looked at a " very , very high " proportion of england 's organic arable farms , he said .
more organic farming would help " restore biodiversity within agricultural landscapes " , dr fuller added .
" less than 3 % of english farmland is organic so there is plenty of scope for an increase in area . "

mr anwar had demanded the compensation in a civil case against the government , former prime minister mahathir mohamad and the then police chief rahim noor .
mr anwar was freed from jail last year after a sentence he said was politically motivated .
he then had surgery for a back injury he said he sustained in the beating .
rahim noor 's apology was read out in court .
" i tan sri abdul rahim noor accept responsibility for the ... assault .
the pain and hurt caused to you and to your family is deeply regretted .
i sincerely apologise to you datuk sri anwar ibrahim and your family for the same , " it said .
mr anwar said he was happy with the statement .
" i , my family , accept the apology , " he said .
moving on " there is no point in going on with this episode .
the pain , anguish and humiliation were huge but i agree that we have to move on , " he added , indicating he may also drop his demand for a public apology from dr mahathir .
the amount of damages he received has not been disclosed .
his lawyer , gobind singh , suggested this was irrelevant .
" my client has maintained from the very beginning that this action is not about money but it was more about showing the police force that they can not do as they please , abuse their position and get away with it , " he said .
mr anwar was the rising star in the malaysian government until he was sacked by dr mahathir in 1998 following a rift with the prime minister over how to run the country 's economy .
mr anwar responded by leading a massive anti-government protest .
that evening police broke down his door and arrested him .
in 1999 he was jailed for six years for corruption , and in 2000 he received a further nine years for sodomy , although that conviction was later quashed .

mr anwar had demanded the compensation in a civil case against the government , former prime minister mahathir mohamad and the then police chief rahim noor .
mr anwar was freed from jail last year after a sentence he said was politically motivated .
he then had surgery for a back injury he said he sustained in the beating .
rahim noor 's apology was read out in court .
" i tan sri abdul rahim noor accept responsibility for the ... assault .
the pain and hurt caused to you and to your family is deeply regretted .
i sincerely apologise to you datuk sri anwar ibrahim and your family for the same , " it said .
mr anwar said he was happy with the statement .
" i , my family , accept the apology , " he said .
moving on " there is no point in going on with this episode .
the pain , anguish and humiliation were huge but i agree that we have to move on , " he added , indicating he may also drop his demand for a public apology from dr mahathir .
the amount of damages he received has not been disclosed .
his lawyer , gobind singh , suggested this was irrelevant .
" my client has maintained from the very beginning that this action is not about money but it was more about showing the police force that they can not do as they please , abuse their position and get away with it , " he said .
mr anwar was the rising star in the malaysian government until he was sacked by dr mahathir in 1998 following a rift with the prime minister over how to run the country 's economy .
mr anwar responded by leading a massive anti-government protest .
that evening police broke down his door and arrested him .
in 1999 he was jailed for six years for corruption , and in 2000 he received a further nine years for sodomy , although that conviction was later quashed .

officers used a combination of tracking and tapping hussain osman 's calls to locate him .
it is relatively simple to follow a person via their mobile phone .
plenty of companies offer technology to do so , legally and with the phone user 's knowledge .
however , the same process can be employed by police to locate the user without alerting them .
detectives need to first identify the phone and then find out where it is .
tracking sim and handset in the case of mr osman , british police had provided their italian counterparts with two mobile numbers linked to him .
the italian police were able to keep tabs on him despite the fact that he changed his sim card along the way .
this is because the phone identifies itself in two ways when it connects to the mobile phone network .
the sim card sends its unique imsi number - standing for international mobile subscriber identity .
this starts with the country code of the user 's account , followed by the network code and finally the telephone number .
the second number is the imei - international mobile equipment identity .
this is the number of the handset and remains constant even if the sim card is changed .
mobile phones transmit these numbers each time they make a call and when they regularly " check in " to the local base stations .
once the police know which mobile they are looking for , it is not hard to locate .
1 -rrb- phone sends signal to nearby base stations 2 -rrb- positioning software performs a triangulation calculation on the information from the base stations 3 -rrb- the data is converted into a geographical location the mobile telephone network is divided into cells with a base station at the centre of each cell .
the base station which processes the call provides the first clue to location , giving police an idea of the general area in which to look .
but other base stations can also make contact with the phone and once information from several base stations has been gathered , the location of the phone can be narrowed down using triangulation .
in built up areas where the base stations are close together this can be to within a few hundred metres ; in rural areas , the system is less accurate .
phone tapping as well as tracking mr osman , italian police listened in to his calls .
they say they heard him speaking in an ethiopian dialect spoken among people from the somali / eritrean border and this encouraged them to believe they had the right man .
one way tapping a mobile phone is with a device called an imsi-catcher .
this pretends to be a legitimate base station of the mobile phone network and tricks the phone into routing its call via the imsi-catcher where it can be passed on for decryption .
once received , the imsi-catcher passes the call on to the network , so the suspect is none the wiser he is being monitored .
however , italian police may have just contacted the mobile phone company to intercept the call .
police mobile phone tapping is particularly prevalent in italy and the country 's state mobile phone network , tim , recently appealed to magistrates to cut the number of requests as it had reached the limit it could cope with .
