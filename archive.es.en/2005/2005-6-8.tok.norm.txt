3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .
" our experiences in the cooperation with the iaea , especially in the iran issue , was excellent , " said fischer .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .
" our experiences in the cooperation with the iaea , especially in the iran issue , was excellent , " said fischer .
" so i have no reasons to complain .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .
not even all the conservatives , the main supporters of a vat hike , believe any hike will finance itself . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .

read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .
and i was not the only one .
this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .
doctors in the lefortovo prison also confirmed that my health condition was fine , even though i was arrested while in hospital , and , finally , the court itself stated in the verdict that i suffered from chronic hepatitis . what do you think about the sentence ? i see the sentence as an assessment of the degree to which i am considered to be a danger and a threat to the interests of degraded and corrupt bureaucrats . … and the position and conduct of the judges ? i feel shame for the judges and their conduct .
they have no right to be judges , let alone be addressed with " your honor . " what , in your mind , is the main reason for initiating the " yukos affair " ? fear and envy . what do you think about the conditions in the prison ?
how are you treated by the prison personnel ?
are you allowed to see your relatives ? no comment .
you will learn everything from the european human rights court . how do you occupy yourself in prison ? i 'm protecting myself , trying to protect others , and trying to live somehow . do you ever wish you were somewhere far away from russia ? never .
a criminal government is one thing , the country is another . what 's your assessment of the current political situation in russia ? it 's unpredictable and possibly explosive . can you read russian and foreign press ? i could in the past , now i ca n't . how do you assess the journalists covering your process ? variously . do you think that there is hope for a positive outcome in the case against you and mikhail khodorkovsky ? on my part , i will do everything possible and even try to do the impossible for a positive outcome , not just for mikhail 's and my sake , but also for our country 's sake .

green parliamentarian volker beck said that pope benedict xvi ’ s attitude toward homosexuality was “ marked by theological mercilessness and the haughtiness of the pharisees . ” manfred burns , spokesperson for the lesbian and gay federation , called benedict ’ s remarks on monday an “ insulting sermon of hate . ” benedict had told italian catholics that gay marriage involved a “ trivialization of the human body . ” “ gay marriage is an expression of an anarchic freedom , which falsely tries to pass itself off as the true liberation of man ... man is not just his body , and that which is biological , is not just biological , but an expression and fulfillment of his humanity , ” the pope said . continuing john paul ii 's mission benedict ’ s position is not radically different from his predecessor ’ s , pope john paul ii : although gay marriage is theologically unfounded , discrimination against gays is also sinful .
john paul was the heavy target of criticism by the lesbian and gay federation .
it called on german bishops to distance themselves from the john paul ’ s ideas on homosexuality in his last book , memory and identity , which the gay advocacy organization called “ inhuman writings . ” until now , german political groups have been careful not to criticize benedict xvi publicly .
although many germans disagree with his stance on issues regarding sexuality , public sympathy has been strong for benedict , the first german pope since 1523 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one could n't see the rainbow flag waving for the new pope since he took office almost two months ago , benedict has not focused his speeches on sexuality , but rather on encouraging peace between nations and reaching out toward protestantism and non-christian religions .
those ideas are not controversial among many western european catholics ; but in issues of sexuality , their attitudes tend statistically , world-wide , to be more libertarian . many catholic voices in the german media had expressed hope that benedict would deviate from his predecessor ’ s line on gay marriage , contraception , abortion , and other sexual issues .

those ideas are not controversial among many western european catholics ; but in issues of sexuality , their attitudes tend statistically , world-wide , to be more libertarian . many catholic voices in the german media had expressed hope that benedict would deviate from his predecessor ’ s line on gay marriage , contraception , abortion , and other sexual issues .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .

blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .
julie smith , deputy director of the center of international studies at the university of cambridge , also doubted britain could repair the divisions tearing europe apart .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .

blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .
julie smith , deputy director of the center of international studies at the university of cambridge , also doubted britain could repair the divisions tearing europe apart .

green parliamentarian volker beck said that pope benedict xvi ’ s attitude toward homosexuality was “ marked by theological mercilessness and the haughtiness of the pharisees . ” manfred burns , spokesperson for the lesbian and gay federation , called benedict ’ s remarks on monday an “ insulting sermon of hate . ” benedict had told italian catholics that gay marriage involved a “ trivialization of the human body . ” “ gay marriage is an expression of an anarchic freedom , which falsely tries to pass itself off as the true liberation of man ... man is not just his body , and that which is biological , is not just biological , but an expression and fulfillment of his humanity , ” the pope said . continuing john paul ii 's mission benedict ’ s position is not radically different from his predecessor ’ s , pope john paul ii : although gay marriage is theologically unfounded , discrimination against gays is also sinful .

those ideas are not controversial among many western european catholics ; but in issues of sexuality , their attitudes tend statistically , world-wide , to be more libertarian . many catholic voices in the german media had expressed hope that benedict would deviate from his predecessor ’ s line on gay marriage , contraception , abortion , and other sexual issues .

to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .

"
to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .
" with a belief in development and in a new generation of people who can create and enjoy , we call all young people together .
all those who can show their creative motivation belong to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max pechstein 's " junges mädchen " through their work , the artists voiced the thoughts of the anti-bourgeois younger generation , who were starting to move towards the idea of sexual freedom and individual autonomy .
they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .
complete collection by way of celebrating the movement , which was the root of expressionism and one of the most important events in the art history of the 20th century , the exhibition in berlin is showing a collection of 300 early prints , never before shown in their entirety .

kirchner experimented a great deal with color at the beginning , making unique prints of the same image with different colors .
fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .
from art nouveau to neo impressionism , from van gogh to munch and matisse to gaugin 's images from the south seas , it is all there for the trained eye to see .
collective brücke style otto mueller , who joined die brücke in 1910 , is represented in the exhibition with bathing pictures , which date back to the days when the group spent long summer holidays deep in the nature surrounding dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " zwei mädchen am wasser " by erich heckel they played with their idea of harmonious unity between art and life and used the viertelstundenakte , in which models changed their pose every fifteen minutes in order to maximise the life element of a situation , to clearly show their new found self-image , which peaked in an almost collective brücke style in 1910 and 1911 .

but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .
' feasible ' concessions for germany " germany can and will make concessions , " schröder said in a press statement during the luxemburg meeting .

" we will use our veto if we have to in order to support the british position , " brown replied .
yet if britain fails to give in on this point , the summit planned for next week is liable to run aground .
since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .

juncker once again warned the nations to seek a compromise .
the summit must see to it that " europe does n't sink into a mire " he said , noting the recent french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
aside from the british payment , further discussion continues on the overall disbursements of the eu from 2007 to 2013 .
the eu commission wants a budget of 1.025 trillion euros .
but the union 's main financial contributors germany , sweden , the netherlands , great britain , france and austria , insist on a sum of 815 billion euros .
luxemburg 's suggestion was a compromise of around 870 billion euros .
schröder seeks offensive tact schröder refused to speculate on whether an agreement could be reached .

but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .
' feasible ' concessions for germany " germany can and will make concessions , " schröder said in a press statement during the luxemburg meeting .
but any compromise has to stay within limits that " have to be financially feasible for germany .
we are n't at that point yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european union flag is seen above the ancient parthenon the decisive question revolves around how much each country has to pay into the communal eu pot .
" we are still far apart on this issue , " schröder said , clearly referring to british discount .
" we will use our veto if we have to in order to support the british position , " brown replied .
yet if britain fails to give in on this point , the summit planned for next week is liable to run aground .
since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .
the other 24 eu states have demanded that the regulation be done away with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu guenter verheugen and the vice-president of the european commission , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , on wednesday described the british rebate as " unreasonable . "
he said the uk must help to fund the bloc 's enlargement .
" there is absolutely nothing to justify that britain does not pay its part of the costs of enlargement , " verheugen told germany 's zdf television .
britain ' unreasonable ' ?
" i find it really unreasonable that one of the richest countries in europe , and that is what britain is today , is being partly financed by europe 's poorest countries , in other words the new members , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude juncker the current eu council chairman jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- wants to meet with blair on tuesday , to discuss possible solutions to the deadlock ; he plans to make a new compromise offer on wednesday .
juncker once again warned the nations to seek a compromise .
the summit must see to it that " europe does n't sink into a mire " he said , noting the recent french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
aside from the british payment , further discussion continues on the overall disbursements of the eu from 2007 to 2013 .
the eu commission wants a budget of 1.025 trillion euros .
but the union 's main financial contributors germany , sweden , the netherlands , great britain , france and austria , insist on a sum of 815 billion euros .
luxemburg 's suggestion was a compromise of around 870 billion euros .
schröder seeks offensive tact schröder refused to speculate on whether an agreement could be reached .
" i and many of my colleagues agree that , especially now , we ca n't allow the european process to just trickle away , " he said .
rather , he said , eu supporters should take an offensive tact .
and he affirmed germany 's wish to see further expansion in the european union . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution .

inanimate objects are also popular ersatz mates . remember the love boat ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2005 germany , britain clash over eu budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they wo n't be so chummy if budget talks fail next week gerhard schröder has said germany is willing to compromise on the eu budget , but britain is sticking to its guns , claiming it will use a veto if need be to retain its discounted payments . germany hopes the eu can reach a budget accord for 2007 to 2103 while luxemburg holds the eu presidency , german chancellor gerhard schröder said tuesday evening .
but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .
' feasible ' concessions for germany " germany can and will make concessions , " schröder said in a press statement during the luxemburg meeting .
but any compromise has to stay within limits that " have to be financially feasible for germany .
we are n't at that point yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european union flag is seen above the ancient parthenon the decisive question revolves around how much each country has to pay into the communal eu pot .
" we are still far apart on this issue , " schröder said , clearly referring to british discount .
" we will use our veto if we have to in order to support the british position , " brown replied .
yet if britain fails to give in on this point , the summit planned for next week is liable to run aground .
since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .
the other 24 eu states have demanded that the regulation be done away with .

he said the uk must help to fund the bloc 's enlargement .
" there is absolutely nothing to justify that britain does not pay its part of the costs of enlargement , " verheugen told germany 's zdf television .
britain ' unreasonable ' ?
" i find it really unreasonable that one of the richest countries in europe , and that is what britain is today , is being partly financed by europe 's poorest countries , in other words the new members , " he added .

juncker once again warned the nations to seek a compromise .
the summit must see to it that " europe does n't sink into a mire " he said , noting the recent french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
aside from the british payment , further discussion continues on the overall disbursements of the eu from 2007 to 2013 .
the eu commission wants a budget of 1.025 trillion euros .
but the union 's main financial contributors germany , sweden , the netherlands , great britain , france and austria , insist on a sum of 815 billion euros .
luxemburg 's suggestion was a compromise of around 870 billion euros .
schröder seeks offensive tact schröder refused to speculate on whether an agreement could be reached .
" i and many of my colleagues agree that , especially now , we ca n't allow the european process to just trickle away , " he said .
rather , he said , eu supporters should take an offensive tact .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2005 germany , britain clash over eu budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they wo n't be so chummy if budget talks fail next week gerhard schröder has said germany is willing to compromise on the eu budget , but britain is sticking to its guns , claiming it will use a veto if need be to retain its discounted payments . germany hopes the eu can reach a budget accord for 2007 to 2103 while luxemburg holds the eu presidency , german chancellor gerhard schröder said tuesday evening .
but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .
' feasible ' concessions for germany " germany can and will make concessions , " schröder said in a press statement during the luxemburg meeting .
but any compromise has to stay within limits that " have to be financially feasible for germany .
we are n't at that point yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european union flag is seen above the ancient parthenon the decisive question revolves around how much each country has to pay into the communal eu pot .
" we are still far apart on this issue , " schröder said , clearly referring to british discount .
" we will use our veto if we have to in order to support the british position , " brown replied .
yet if britain fails to give in on this point , the summit planned for next week is liable to run aground .
since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .
the other 24 eu states have demanded that the regulation be done away with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu guenter verheugen and the vice-president of the european commission , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , on wednesday described the british rebate as " unreasonable . "
he said the uk must help to fund the bloc 's enlargement .
" there is absolutely nothing to justify that britain does not pay its part of the costs of enlargement , " verheugen told germany 's zdf television .
britain ' unreasonable ' ?
" i find it really unreasonable that one of the richest countries in europe , and that is what britain is today , is being partly financed by europe 's poorest countries , in other words the new members , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude juncker the current eu council chairman jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- wants to meet with blair on tuesday , to discuss possible solutions to the deadlock ; he plans to make a new compromise offer on wednesday .
juncker once again warned the nations to seek a compromise .
the summit must see to it that " europe does n't sink into a mire " he said , noting the recent french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
aside from the british payment , further discussion continues on the overall disbursements of the eu from 2007 to 2013 .
the eu commission wants a budget of 1.025 trillion euros .
but the union 's main financial contributors germany , sweden , the netherlands , great britain , france and austria , insist on a sum of 815 billion euros .
luxemburg 's suggestion was a compromise of around 870 billion euros .
schröder seeks offensive tact schröder refused to speculate on whether an agreement could be reached .
" i and many of my colleagues agree that , especially now , we ca n't allow the european process to just trickle away , " he said .
rather , he said , eu supporters should take an offensive tact .
and he affirmed germany 's wish to see further expansion in the european union . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .
leadership vacuum but the current state of affairs leaves the eu with a leadership vacuum , said richard whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder and tony blair he added that despite the weakness of europe 's traditional steering axis of germany and france , blair is not in a position to drive the eu along a road more suited to britain .
" france and germany have already lost some their leadership potential because of their behavior over recent years , not least wrecking the stability and growth pact .
they 've lost a lot of good will from smaller member states , " he told the afp news service .
but britain hardly occupies a strong position itself .
" britain is not in the core of the european integration project , not in the euro zone and it does n't have the same relationship to the stability and growth pact , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac stumped hard for the constitution the french believed that the constitution , in opposition to their preferred big-government model , opened the door to right-wing " anglo-saxon " economic liberalism - namely the deregulated markets in public services operating in britain and the united states .
blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .
julie smith , deputy director of the center of international studies at the university of cambridge , also doubted britain could repair the divisions tearing europe apart .
" now is a time to say what are the things that really bind us , what are the things on which we all agree , and how to move forward , " she told afp .
" unfortunately the -lrb- british -rrb- agenda is not one of those things that binds us .
the more -lrb- blair -rrb- tries to push that the less he is going to influence the union effectively .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .
leadership vacuum but the current state of affairs leaves the eu with a leadership vacuum , said richard whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder and tony blair he added that despite the weakness of europe 's traditional steering axis of germany and france , blair is not in a position to drive the eu along a road more suited to britain .
" france and germany have already lost some their leadership potential because of their behavior over recent years , not least wrecking the stability and growth pact .
they 've lost a lot of good will from smaller member states , " he told the afp news service .
but britain hardly occupies a strong position itself .
" britain is not in the core of the european integration project , not in the euro zone and it does n't have the same relationship to the stability and growth pact , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac stumped hard for the constitution the french believed that the constitution , in opposition to their preferred big-government model , opened the door to right-wing " anglo-saxon " economic liberalism - namely the deregulated markets in public services operating in britain and the united states .
blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .
julie smith , deputy director of the center of international studies at the university of cambridge , also doubted britain could repair the divisions tearing europe apart .
" now is a time to say what are the things that really bind us , what are the things on which we all agree , and how to move forward , " she told afp .

"
to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .
" with a belief in development and in a new generation of people who can create and enjoy , we call all young people together .
all those who can show their creative motivation belong to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max pechstein 's " junges mädchen " through their work , the artists voiced the thoughts of the anti-bourgeois younger generation , who were starting to move towards the idea of sexual freedom and individual autonomy .
they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .
complete collection by way of celebrating the movement , which was the root of expressionism and one of the most important events in the art history of the 20th century , the exhibition in berlin is showing a collection of 300 early prints , never before shown in their entirety .

kirchner experimented a great deal with color at the beginning , making unique prints of the same image with different colors .
fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .
from art nouveau to neo impressionism , from van gogh to munch and matisse to gaugin 's images from the south seas , it is all there for the trained eye to see .
collective brücke style otto mueller , who joined die brücke in 1910 , is represented in the exhibition with bathing pictures , which date back to the days when the group spent long summer holidays deep in the nature surrounding dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " zwei mädchen am wasser " by erich heckel they played with their idea of harmonious unity between art and life and used the viertelstundenakte , in which models changed their pose every fifteen minutes in order to maximise the life element of a situation , to clearly show their new found self-image , which peaked in an almost collective brücke style in 1910 and 1911 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.06.2005 getting young germans into politics 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war protests are n't the only way to get youth politically active early federal elections in germany are around the corner .
policies that affect 16 to 30-year olds are not high on the political agenda however .
nevertheless , political and non-political groups are reaching out to them . it was not difficult to pick out ole erdmann out of the small group seated around two tables in bonn 's cafe nyx .
the university student is animated and emanates an air of authority .
most importantly , he exudes optimism , something he and his cohorts in the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- , the youth fraction of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , need .
the defeat of the spd in state elections in north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- on may 22 - after 39 years of rule - sent shock waves throughout the jusos in all of nrw .
a positive spin had to be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole erdmann " on election evening , four or five people joined , " said erdmann -lrb- photo -rrb- .
they will need the new manpower .
nine lost state elections in a row like the social democrats have suffered does not exactly stir up cheerfulness and enthusiasm .
" you have to bring a lot of idealism with you , " said katrin bierwirt who has been a juso member for six years .
a time where she has watched a slow , steady decline of the party 's popularity across the country despite it being in power in berlin .
with the exception of schröder 's reelection in 2002 , victory parties for the spd have been far and few between .
unemployment , tuition worries the most recent unemployment benefits laws , particularly hartz iv , named after peter hartz , the man who helped draw up the legislation and who also is head of personnel at vw , are reason for concern with the jusos .
up until the late 1990 's , germany 's welfare and unemployment recipients lived relatively secure lives .
the sagging economy and huge federal deficits since then have caused the center-left government in berlin to make harsh cuts .
having no job is no longer an option , at least that 's the word from berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested against social welfare cuts in leipzig in 2004 .
nevertheless , they got hartz iv and the cuts in 2005 " if someone graduates from university and is n't sure he 'll find a job , " explained erdmann , " and then is sitting on college tuition debts , which is what the opposition is promoting , then things will be a lot worse .
hartz iv is a huge problem . "
yet the jusos are n't expecting to see any changes within the labor market .
the hartz laws are fully embedded in schröder 's " agenda 2010 " which is supposed to reform the german labor market and result in a stronger german economy .
where they now will see changes is in the university system .
cdu youth for tuition before being elected in may , the cdu in nrw pledged to introduce tuition fees at the state 's universities .
albeit they are planning a modest 500 euro per semester fee , the junge union -lrb- ju -rrb- , the group for those under 35 in the cdu but predominantly made up of students , thinks the move is long overdue .
german universities suffer from overcrowding and underfunding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to levy tuition fees so that lecture halls at universities can continue to be funded " the fact that we won the state election means that tuition will be introduced at universities in nrw , " said hans-peter bröhl , head of the cologne ju .
" there should be tuition for the duration of studies and repayment would start once the graduate found a job . "

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .
not even all the conservatives , the main supporters of a vat hike , believe any hike will finance itself . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .
leadership vacuum but the current state of affairs leaves the eu with a leadership vacuum , said richard whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder and tony blair he added that despite the weakness of europe 's traditional steering axis of germany and france , blair is not in a position to drive the eu along a road more suited to britain .
" france and germany have already lost some their leadership potential because of their behavior over recent years , not least wrecking the stability and growth pact .
they 've lost a lot of good will from smaller member states , " he told the afp news service .
but britain hardly occupies a strong position itself .
" britain is not in the core of the european integration project , not in the euro zone and it does n't have the same relationship to the stability and growth pact , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac stumped hard for the constitution the french believed that the constitution , in opposition to their preferred big-government model , opened the door to right-wing " anglo-saxon " economic liberalism - namely the deregulated markets in public services operating in britain and the united states .
blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .
julie smith , deputy director of the center of international studies at the university of cambridge , also doubted britain could repair the divisions tearing europe apart .
" now is a time to say what are the things that really bind us , what are the things on which we all agree , and how to move forward , " she told afp .
" unfortunately the -lrb- british -rrb- agenda is not one of those things that binds us .
the more -lrb- blair -rrb- tries to push that the less he is going to influence the union effectively .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .
" our experiences in the cooperation with the iaea , especially in the iran issue , was excellent , " said fischer .

policies that affect 16 to 30-year olds are not high on the political agenda however .
nevertheless , political and non-political groups are reaching out to them . it was not difficult to pick out ole erdmann out of the small group seated around two tables in bonn 's cafe nyx .
the university student is animated and emanates an air of authority .
most importantly , he exudes optimism , something he and his cohorts in the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- , the youth fraction of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , need .
the defeat of the spd in state elections in north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- on may 22 - after 39 years of rule - sent shock waves throughout the jusos in all of nrw .
a positive spin had to be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole erdmann " on election evening , four or five people joined , " said erdmann -lrb- photo -rrb- .
they will need the new manpower .
nine lost state elections in a row like the social democrats have suffered does not exactly stir up cheerfulness and enthusiasm .
" you have to bring a lot of idealism with you , " said katrin bierwirt who has been a juso member for six years .
a time where she has watched a slow , steady decline of the party 's popularity across the country despite it being in power in berlin .
with the exception of schröder 's reelection in 2002 , victory parties for the spd have been far and few between .
unemployment , tuition worries the most recent unemployment benefits laws , particularly hartz iv , named after peter hartz , the man who helped draw up the legislation and who also is head of personnel at vw , are reason for concern with the jusos .
up until the late 1990 's , germany 's welfare and unemployment recipients lived relatively secure lives .
the sagging economy and huge federal deficits since then have caused the center-left government in berlin to make harsh cuts .
having no job is no longer an option , at least that 's the word from berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested against social welfare cuts in leipzig in 2004 .
nevertheless , they got hartz iv and the cuts in 2005 " if someone graduates from university and is n't sure he 'll find a job , " explained erdmann , " and then is sitting on college tuition debts , which is what the opposition is promoting , then things will be a lot worse .
hartz iv is a huge problem . "
yet the jusos are n't expecting to see any changes within the labor market .
the hartz laws are fully embedded in schröder 's " agenda 2010 " which is supposed to reform the german labor market and result in a stronger german economy .
where they now will see changes is in the university system .
cdu youth for tuition before being elected in may , the cdu in nrw pledged to introduce tuition fees at the state 's universities .
albeit they are planning a modest 500 euro per semester fee , the junge union -lrb- ju -rrb- , the group for those under 35 in the cdu but predominantly made up of students , thinks the move is long overdue .
german universities suffer from overcrowding and underfunding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to levy tuition fees so that lecture halls at universities can continue to be funded " the fact that we won the state election means that tuition will be introduced at universities in nrw , " said hans-peter bröhl , head of the cologne ju .
" there should be tuition for the duration of studies and repayment would start once the graduate found a job . "

but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .
' feasible ' concessions for germany " germany can and will make concessions , " schröder said in a press statement during the luxemburg meeting .
but any compromise has to stay within limits that " have to be financially feasible for germany .
we are n't at that point yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european union flag is seen above the ancient parthenon the decisive question revolves around how much each country has to pay into the communal eu pot .
" we are still far apart on this issue , " schröder said , clearly referring to british discount .
" we will use our veto if we have to in order to support the british position , " brown replied .
yet if britain fails to give in on this point , the summit planned for next week is liable to run aground .
since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .
the other 24 eu states have demanded that the regulation be done away with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu guenter verheugen and the vice-president of the european commission , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , on wednesday described the british rebate as " unreasonable . "
he said the uk must help to fund the bloc 's enlargement .
" there is absolutely nothing to justify that britain does not pay its part of the costs of enlargement , " verheugen told germany 's zdf television .
britain ' unreasonable ' ?
" i find it really unreasonable that one of the richest countries in europe , and that is what britain is today , is being partly financed by europe 's poorest countries , in other words the new members , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude juncker the current eu council chairman jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- wants to meet with blair on tuesday , to discuss possible solutions to the deadlock ; he plans to make a new compromise offer on wednesday .
juncker once again warned the nations to seek a compromise .
the summit must see to it that " europe does n't sink into a mire " he said , noting the recent french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
aside from the british payment , further discussion continues on the overall disbursements of the eu from 2007 to 2013 .
the eu commission wants a budget of 1.025 trillion euros .
but the union 's main financial contributors germany , sweden , the netherlands , great britain , france and austria , insist on a sum of 815 billion euros .
luxemburg 's suggestion was a compromise of around 870 billion euros .
schröder seeks offensive tact schröder refused to speculate on whether an agreement could be reached .
" i and many of my colleagues agree that , especially now , we ca n't allow the european process to just trickle away , " he said .
rather , he said , eu supporters should take an offensive tact .
and he affirmed germany 's wish to see further expansion in the european union . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution .

their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .
" with a belief in development and in a new generation of people who can create and enjoy , we call all young people together .
all those who can show their creative motivation belong to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max pechstein 's " junges mädchen " through their work , the artists voiced the thoughts of the anti-bourgeois younger generation , who were starting to move towards the idea of sexual freedom and individual autonomy .
they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .
complete collection by way of celebrating the movement , which was the root of expressionism and one of the most important events in the art history of the 20th century , the exhibition in berlin is showing a collection of 300 early prints , never before shown in their entirety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst ludwig kirchner , czardastänzerinnen , 1908/1920 " through the gifts from erich heckel and karl schmidt-rottluff , we have a whole series of very rare copies .
kirchner experimented a great deal with color at the beginning , making unique prints of the same image with different colors .
fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .
from art nouveau to neo impressionism , from van gogh to munch and matisse to gaugin 's images from the south seas , it is all there for the trained eye to see .
collective brücke style otto mueller , who joined die brücke in 1910 , is represented in the exhibition with bathing pictures , which date back to the days when the group spent long summer holidays deep in the nature surrounding dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " zwei mädchen am wasser " by erich heckel they played with their idea of harmonious unity between art and life and used the viertelstundenakte , in which models changed their pose every fifteen minutes in order to maximise the life element of a situation , to clearly show their new found self-image , which peaked in an almost collective brücke style in 1910 and 1911 .
the group eventually moved from dresden to berlin , where a new manifesto drawn up by ernst ludwig kirchner sent them scattering in different directions .
but now they are back together in the capital 's neue nationalgalerie , and can be viewed there until 2nd october . ute büsing -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german painter provokes with " aryan art " german painter norbert bisky has been criticized for toying with the aestheticism of fascism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.06.2005 getting young germans into politics back to first page back 2/2 while the cologne ju is on the same wavelength with the party on the question of tuition fees , they do clash on other subjects .
one burning issue for cologne according to bröhl is urban flight .
young families are leaving cologne to the suburbs yet then commute to the city to work .
in other words , they are taking advantage of the city 's infrastructure without having to pay for it .
" it 's my opinion that tax exemptions for commuting to work should be abolished , " he explained .
but the nrw ju , dominated primarily by groups from the bedroom communities , is in favor of keeping the tax break according to bröhl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban flight is a problem in cologne according to the ju that may be a small chink in the cologne ju 's armor , but the group is proud of recent successes .
in the last three years , membership has doubled .
bröhl pointed out that online interest is rising steadily .
but not everyone feels compelled to join a political party to be politically active .
reaching out the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- in bonn acts an outpost to help young and old alike inform themselves more about how they can more influence the political scene .
in the 1960 's and 70 's , students for the most part , directed their activism towards political institutions .
yet this is no longer the case .
" you ca n't say that young people have given up being politically active , " bpb president thomas krüger said .
" activism is not directed at the institutions , let alone the parties .
it 's project-based .
young people are interested in particular subjects such as the environment or globalization .
research shows that subject-oriented activism is widespread , but with a much less parliamentary aspect .
that is what people have to understand as being politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can also turn to the bpb 's online presence for information krüger grew up in communist east germany and believes the pursuit of democracy is important despite its shortcomings .
political education must be an individual pursuit .
young people should take anything that smacks of indoctrination , political parties included , with a grain of salt .
krüger is absolutely convinced that credibility is the decisive characteristic that today 's youth feel is lacking in politics .
teenagers and those in their 20 's can move things politically .
party politics is one way but as krüger puts it , society and democracy has come to a point , where a different kind of " political being " exists and has to be further cultivated . john kluempers , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .
-lrb- june 6 , 2005 -rrb- conservatism : the new rebellion ?
much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .
not even all the conservatives , the main supporters of a vat hike , believe any hike will finance itself . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work .
-lrb- april 5 , 2005 -rrb- a tax on mastication ?
it 's a rare day in germany when opposing politicians agree on a sticky issue .
but when it comes to keeping the streets clean of chewing gum , they are ready to do just that .
-lrb- may 3 , 2005 -rrb- flat tax revolution puts europe on edge in bratislava last week , george w. bush praised slovakia 's new flat tax .
but what bush finds inspiring is infuriating western european leaders .

read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .
and i was not the only one .
this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .
" our experiences in the cooperation with the iaea , especially in the iran issue , was excellent , " said fischer .

a german sex psychologist says more and more people are calling their true loves by a " pet " name - which is only appropriate , when their partners are pooches .
inanimate objects are also popular ersatz mates . remember the love boat ?
how about the love ferry ?
german sex psychologist and researcher volkmar sigusch sees a trend toward people having love ties to inanimate objects - such as a boat - or to house pets , as well as having no emotional ties at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's unlikely to propose to her washing machine the renowned academic , who heads the frankfurt based german society for sex research , recently published a book called neosexualitäten , or neo-sexuality , in which he describes the " cultural change of love and perversion " in modern society .
" we live in a situation where things that were once proscribed or embarrassing or shameful can now be expressed , " he said .
" today we talk about things that used to be hidden . "
two of the trends he sees are towards asexuality - where for varied reasons people show no sexual desire at all - and objectophilia , a sexual obsession with objects or house pets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i pronounce you man and bitch " : dog weddings are not unheard of in florida in his book , sigusch describes a woman whose love life gave new meaning to the term partner-ship when she fell in love with a ferry .
she thought about the boat obsessively , photographed it , then decorated the photographs .
she was " enraptured like one in love , " he wrote .
the scientist also considers people to be objectophiles who treat their pets - mostly cats and dogs , but sometimes lizards - like beloved partners .
they hug and kiss them , spoil them , take them on vacation , dress them up - even send them to spas or summer camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's in the driver 's seat here ?
" some love their pets more than they have ever loved a person , " he said .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .
not even all the conservatives , the main supporters of a vat hike , believe any hike will finance itself . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy .

the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?

a german sex psychologist says more and more people are calling their true loves by a " pet " name - which is only appropriate , when their partners are pooches .
inanimate objects are also popular ersatz mates . remember the love boat ?
how about the love ferry ?
german sex psychologist and researcher volkmar sigusch sees a trend toward people having love ties to inanimate objects - such as a boat - or to house pets , as well as having no emotional ties at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's unlikely to propose to her washing machine the renowned academic , who heads the frankfurt based german society for sex research , recently published a book called neosexualitäten , or neo-sexuality , in which he describes the " cultural change of love and perversion " in modern society .
" we live in a situation where things that were once proscribed or embarrassing or shameful can now be expressed , " he said .
" today we talk about things that used to be hidden . "
two of the trends he sees are towards asexuality - where for varied reasons people show no sexual desire at all - and objectophilia , a sexual obsession with objects or house pets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i pronounce you man and bitch " : dog weddings are not unheard of in florida in his book , sigusch describes a woman whose love life gave new meaning to the term partner-ship when she fell in love with a ferry .
she thought about the boat obsessively , photographed it , then decorated the photographs .
she was " enraptured like one in love , " he wrote .
the scientist also considers people to be objectophiles who treat their pets - mostly cats and dogs , but sometimes lizards - like beloved partners .
they hug and kiss them , spoil them , take them on vacation , dress them up - even send them to spas or summer camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's in the driver 's seat here ?
" some love their pets more than they have ever loved a person , " he said .
those who worry that there can be no future for such a union can take heart in sigusch 's prediction that it will only be a few decades before such " partnerships " are openly recognized . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dna against doggy droppings dna analysis is useful in solving crimes , determining parentage and making medical advances .

read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .
and i was not the only one .
this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .
doctors in the lefortovo prison also confirmed that my health condition was fine , even though i was arrested while in hospital , and , finally , the court itself stated in the verdict that i suffered from chronic hepatitis . what do you think about the sentence ? i see the sentence as an assessment of the degree to which i am considered to be a danger and a threat to the interests of degraded and corrupt bureaucrats . … and the position and conduct of the judges ? i feel shame for the judges and their conduct .
they have no right to be judges , let alone be addressed with " your honor . " what , in your mind , is the main reason for initiating the " yukos affair " ? fear and envy . what do you think about the conditions in the prison ?
how are you treated by the prison personnel ?
are you allowed to see your relatives ? no comment .
you will learn everything from the european human rights court . how do you occupy yourself in prison ? i 'm protecting myself , trying to protect others , and trying to live somehow . do you ever wish you were somewhere far away from russia ? never .
a criminal government is one thing , the country is another . what 's your assessment of the current political situation in russia ? it 's unpredictable and possibly explosive . can you read russian and foreign press ? i could in the past , now i ca n't . how do you assess the journalists covering your process ? variously . do you think that there is hope for a positive outcome in the case against you and mikhail khodorkovsky ? on my part , i will do everything possible and even try to do the impossible for a positive outcome , not just for mikhail 's and my sake , but also for our country 's sake .

green parliamentarian volker beck said that pope benedict xvi ’ s attitude toward homosexuality was “ marked by theological mercilessness and the haughtiness of the pharisees . ” manfred burns , spokesperson for the lesbian and gay federation , called benedict ’ s remarks on monday an “ insulting sermon of hate . ” benedict had told italian catholics that gay marriage involved a “ trivialization of the human body . ” “ gay marriage is an expression of an anarchic freedom , which falsely tries to pass itself off as the true liberation of man ... man is not just his body , and that which is biological , is not just biological , but an expression and fulfillment of his humanity , ” the pope said . continuing john paul ii 's mission benedict ’ s position is not radically different from his predecessor ’ s , pope john paul ii : although gay marriage is theologically unfounded , discrimination against gays is also sinful .
john paul was the heavy target of criticism by the lesbian and gay federation .
it called on german bishops to distance themselves from the john paul ’ s ideas on homosexuality in his last book , memory and identity , which the gay advocacy organization called “ inhuman writings . ” until now , german political groups have been careful not to criticize benedict xvi publicly .
although many germans disagree with his stance on issues regarding sexuality , public sympathy has been strong for benedict , the first german pope since 1523 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one could n't see the rainbow flag waving for the new pope since he took office almost two months ago , benedict has not focused his speeches on sexuality , but rather on encouraging peace between nations and reaching out toward protestantism and non-christian religions .
those ideas are not controversial among many western european catholics ; but in issues of sexuality , their attitudes tend statistically , world-wide , to be more libertarian . many catholic voices in the german media had expressed hope that benedict would deviate from his predecessor ’ s line on gay marriage , contraception , abortion , and other sexual issues .
but monday ’ s speech , and the reaction to it , appear to signal no change in the frustration among gay advocacy groups with the pope ’ s conservative views on sexuality and social issues . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

"
both sides will improve cooperation on railway-equipment design and manufacturing , railway lines and equipment maintenance , information technology and other technologies in the sector .

"
to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .
" with a belief in development and in a new generation of people who can create and enjoy , we call all young people together .
all those who can show their creative motivation belong to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max pechstein 's " junges mädchen " through their work , the artists voiced the thoughts of the anti-bourgeois younger generation , who were starting to move towards the idea of sexual freedom and individual autonomy .
they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .
complete collection by way of celebrating the movement , which was the root of expressionism and one of the most important events in the art history of the 20th century , the exhibition in berlin is showing a collection of 300 early prints , never before shown in their entirety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst ludwig kirchner , czardastänzerinnen , 1908/1920 " through the gifts from erich heckel and karl schmidt-rottluff , we have a whole series of very rare copies .
kirchner experimented a great deal with color at the beginning , making unique prints of the same image with different colors .
fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .
from art nouveau to neo impressionism , from van gogh to munch and matisse to gaugin 's images from the south seas , it is all there for the trained eye to see .
collective brücke style otto mueller , who joined die brücke in 1910 , is represented in the exhibition with bathing pictures , which date back to the days when the group spent long summer holidays deep in the nature surrounding dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " zwei mädchen am wasser " by erich heckel they played with their idea of harmonious unity between art and life and used the viertelstundenakte , in which models changed their pose every fifteen minutes in order to maximise the life element of a situation , to clearly show their new found self-image , which peaked in an almost collective brücke style in 1910 and 1911 .
the group eventually moved from dresden to berlin , where a new manifesto drawn up by ernst ludwig kirchner sent them scattering in different directions .

green parliamentarian volker beck said that pope benedict xvi ’ s attitude toward homosexuality was “ marked by theological mercilessness and the haughtiness of the pharisees . ” manfred burns , spokesperson for the lesbian and gay federation , called benedict ’ s remarks on monday an “ insulting sermon of hate . ” benedict had told italian catholics that gay marriage involved a “ trivialization of the human body . ” “ gay marriage is an expression of an anarchic freedom , which falsely tries to pass itself off as the true liberation of man ... man is not just his body , and that which is biological , is not just biological , but an expression and fulfillment of his humanity , ” the pope said . continuing john paul ii 's mission benedict ’ s position is not radically different from his predecessor ’ s , pope john paul ii : although gay marriage is theologically unfounded , discrimination against gays is also sinful .
john paul was the heavy target of criticism by the lesbian and gay federation .
it called on german bishops to distance themselves from the john paul ’ s ideas on homosexuality in his last book , memory and identity , which the gay advocacy organization called “ inhuman writings . ” until now , german political groups have been careful not to criticize benedict xvi publicly .
although many germans disagree with his stance on issues regarding sexuality , public sympathy has been strong for benedict , the first german pope since 1523 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one could n't see the rainbow flag waving for the new pope since he took office almost two months ago , benedict has not focused his speeches on sexuality , but rather on encouraging peace between nations and reaching out toward protestantism and non-christian religions .
those ideas are not controversial among many western european catholics ; but in issues of sexuality , their attitudes tend statistically , world-wide , to be more libertarian . many catholic voices in the german media had expressed hope that benedict would deviate from his predecessor ’ s line on gay marriage , contraception , abortion , and other sexual issues .
but monday ’ s speech , and the reaction to it , appear to signal no change in the frustration among gay advocacy groups with the pope ’ s conservative views on sexuality and social issues . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .
not even all the conservatives , the main supporters of a vat hike , believe any hike will finance itself . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work .

it 's a rare day in germany when opposing politicians agree on a sticky issue .
but when it comes to keeping the streets clean of chewing gum , they are ready to do just that .

"
to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .

they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .
complete collection by way of celebrating the movement , which was the root of expressionism and one of the most important events in the art history of the 20th century , the exhibition in berlin is showing a collection of 300 early prints , never before shown in their entirety .

kirchner experimented a great deal with color at the beginning , making unique prints of the same image with different colors .
fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .
from art nouveau to neo impressionism , from van gogh to munch and matisse to gaugin 's images from the south seas , it is all there for the trained eye to see .

"
both sides will improve cooperation on railway-equipment design and manufacturing , railway lines and equipment maintenance , information technology and other technologies in the sector .
leg up on the competition ?
state media said the agreement signals that germany 's maglev train builder has made a breakthrough in competition for high-speed rail orders from china against its french and japanese rivals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maglev train at platform in shanghai maglev technology was developed by transrapid international , a consortium comprising german industrial giants thyssenkrupp and siemens .
it allows trains to barrel at speeds of up to 430 kilometers per hour .
china currently operates a short maglev line linking shanghai 's new airport to the city .
china planned last year to invest some $ 16 billion -lrb- 13 billion euros -rrb- to build a high speed link between shanghai and beijing - a top priority project for the nation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2005 can britain save europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions to the eu 's woes wo n't be easy for tony blair to find britain takes over the european union 's presidency next month .
but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .
leadership vacuum but the current state of affairs leaves the eu with a leadership vacuum , said richard whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder and tony blair he added that despite the weakness of europe 's traditional steering axis of germany and france , blair is not in a position to drive the eu along a road more suited to britain .
" france and germany have already lost some their leadership potential because of their behavior over recent years , not least wrecking the stability and growth pact .
they 've lost a lot of good will from smaller member states , " he told the afp news service .
but britain hardly occupies a strong position itself .
" britain is not in the core of the european integration project , not in the euro zone and it does n't have the same relationship to the stability and growth pact , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac stumped hard for the constitution the french believed that the constitution , in opposition to their preferred big-government model , opened the door to right-wing " anglo-saxon " economic liberalism - namely the deregulated markets in public services operating in britain and the united states .
blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .

berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder and tony blair he added that despite the weakness of europe 's traditional steering axis of germany and france , blair is not in a position to drive the eu along a road more suited to britain .
" france and germany have already lost some their leadership potential because of their behavior over recent years , not least wrecking the stability and growth pact .
they 've lost a lot of good will from smaller member states , " he told the afp news service .
but britain hardly occupies a strong position itself .
" britain is not in the core of the european integration project , not in the euro zone and it does n't have the same relationship to the stability and growth pact , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac stumped hard for the constitution the french believed that the constitution , in opposition to their preferred big-government model , opened the door to right-wing " anglo-saxon " economic liberalism - namely the deregulated markets in public services operating in britain and the united states .
blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .
julie smith , deputy director of the center of international studies at the university of cambridge , also doubted britain could repair the divisions tearing europe apart .
" now is a time to say what are the things that really bind us , what are the things on which we all agree , and how to move forward , " she told afp .
" unfortunately the -lrb- british -rrb- agenda is not one of those things that binds us .
the more -lrb- blair -rrb- tries to push that the less he is going to influence the union effectively .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .
not even all the conservatives , the main supporters of a vat hike , believe any hike will finance itself . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .
not even all the conservatives , the main supporters of a vat hike , believe any hike will finance itself . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work .
-lrb- april 5 , 2005 -rrb- a tax on mastication ?
it 's a rare day in germany when opposing politicians agree on a sticky issue .
but when it comes to keeping the streets clean of chewing gum , they are ready to do just that .

one burning issue for cologne according to bröhl is urban flight .
young families are leaving cologne to the suburbs yet then commute to the city to work .
in other words , they are taking advantage of the city 's infrastructure without having to pay for it .
" it 's my opinion that tax exemptions for commuting to work should be abolished , " he explained .
but the nrw ju , dominated primarily by groups from the bedroom communities , is in favor of keeping the tax break according to bröhl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban flight is a problem in cologne according to the ju that may be a small chink in the cologne ju 's armor , but the group is proud of recent successes .
in the last three years , membership has doubled .
bröhl pointed out that online interest is rising steadily .
but not everyone feels compelled to join a political party to be politically active .
reaching out the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- in bonn acts an outpost to help young and old alike inform themselves more about how they can more influence the political scene .
in the 1960 's and 70 's , students for the most part , directed their activism towards political institutions .
yet this is no longer the case .
" you ca n't say that young people have given up being politically active , " bpb president thomas krüger said .
" activism is not directed at the institutions , let alone the parties .
it 's project-based .
young people are interested in particular subjects such as the environment or globalization .
research shows that subject-oriented activism is widespread , but with a much less parliamentary aspect .
that is what people have to understand as being politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can also turn to the bpb 's online presence for information krüger grew up in communist east germany and believes the pursuit of democracy is important despite its shortcomings .
political education must be an individual pursuit .
young people should take anything that smacks of indoctrination , political parties included , with a grain of salt .
krüger is absolutely convinced that credibility is the decisive characteristic that today 's youth feel is lacking in politics .
teenagers and those in their 20 's can move things politically .
party politics is one way but as krüger puts it , society and democracy has come to a point , where a different kind of " political being " exists and has to be further cultivated . john kluempers , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2005 interview : lebedev feels shame for judges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebedev -lrb- right -rrb- and khordokovsky -lrb- left -rrb- during the trial platon lebedev was recently sentenced to nine years in a labor camp , along with his business partner and former russian oil magnate , mikhail khodorkovsky .
read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .
and i was not the only one .
this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .
doctors in the lefortovo prison also confirmed that my health condition was fine , even though i was arrested while in hospital , and , finally , the court itself stated in the verdict that i suffered from chronic hepatitis . what do you think about the sentence ? i see the sentence as an assessment of the degree to which i am considered to be a danger and a threat to the interests of degraded and corrupt bureaucrats . … and the position and conduct of the judges ? i feel shame for the judges and their conduct .
they have no right to be judges , let alone be addressed with " your honor . " what , in your mind , is the main reason for initiating the " yukos affair " ? fear and envy . what do you think about the conditions in the prison ?
how are you treated by the prison personnel ?

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .
not even all the conservatives , the main supporters of a vat hike , believe any hike will finance itself . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work .
-lrb- april 5 , 2005 -rrb- a tax on mastication ?
it 's a rare day in germany when opposing politicians agree on a sticky issue .
but when it comes to keeping the streets clean of chewing gum , they are ready to do just that .

"
to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .

they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .
complete collection by way of celebrating the movement , which was the root of expressionism and one of the most important events in the art history of the 20th century , the exhibition in berlin is showing a collection of 300 early prints , never before shown in their entirety .

kirchner experimented a great deal with color at the beginning , making unique prints of the same image with different colors .
fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .
from art nouveau to neo impressionism , from van gogh to munch and matisse to gaugin 's images from the south seas , it is all there for the trained eye to see .

" in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .
" with a belief in development and in a new generation of people who can create and enjoy , we call all young people together .
all those who can show their creative motivation belong to us . "

a german sex psychologist says more and more people are calling their true loves by a " pet " name - which is only appropriate , when their partners are pooches .
inanimate objects are also popular ersatz mates . remember the love boat ?
how about the love ferry ?
german sex psychologist and researcher volkmar sigusch sees a trend toward people having love ties to inanimate objects - such as a boat - or to house pets , as well as having no emotional ties at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's unlikely to propose to her washing machine the renowned academic , who heads the frankfurt based german society for sex research , recently published a book called neosexualitäten , or neo-sexuality , in which he describes the " cultural change of love and perversion " in modern society .
" we live in a situation where things that were once proscribed or embarrassing or shameful can now be expressed , " he said .
" today we talk about things that used to be hidden . "
two of the trends he sees are towards asexuality - where for varied reasons people show no sexual desire at all - and objectophilia , a sexual obsession with objects or house pets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i pronounce you man and bitch " : dog weddings are not unheard of in florida in his book , sigusch describes a woman whose love life gave new meaning to the term partner-ship when she fell in love with a ferry .
she thought about the boat obsessively , photographed it , then decorated the photographs .
she was " enraptured like one in love , " he wrote .
the scientist also considers people to be objectophiles who treat their pets - mostly cats and dogs , but sometimes lizards - like beloved partners .
they hug and kiss them , spoil them , take them on vacation , dress them up - even send them to spas or summer camps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's in the driver 's seat here ?
" some love their pets more than they have ever loved a person , " he said .
those who worry that there can be no future for such a union can take heart in sigusch 's prediction that it will only be a few decades before such " partnerships " are openly recognized . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dna against doggy droppings dna analysis is useful in solving crimes , determining parentage and making medical advances .

his testimony suggests the crime ring stretches to turkey and beyond . it could be the case of the one that got away .
the croat , known only as milan p. , a suspect in the german match-fixing scandal , was released from custody on tuesday after four months detention despite being the connection between germany 's biggest sporting scandal and an international crime ring rigging soccer matches all over the continent and beyond . the 39-year old , the proprietor of berlins king cafe - the front for a betting manipulation ring that was exposed last year - was released by the berlin public prosecutor 's office after a three and a half hour review of his case .
it is believed that information he passed to investigators helped smooth his release . match rigging scandal with international scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and turkey are just two countries which could be linked by the scandal milan p. and his brother ante could be the connection between a spate of match fixing and referee manipulation in the german bundesliga and a wider network of rigged betting offences . the croat is said to have admitted to traveling to turkey in 2004 to bribe a midfield player and another colleague at the turkish super league club mke ankaragücü to throw a game against galatasary istanbul for 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 18,000 -rrb- .
in the end , the fix was not completed due to the midfielder refusing the offer and the ankara team won 1-0 . after intensive investigation , the croat 's testimony was upheld by the prosecutor 's office after conclusive proof of the approach , in the form of sms messages to his brother ante , was revealed .

hoyzer himself escaped a prison sentence by revealing his dealings with ante and milan , who have allegedly been active in austria , england , greece and italy . milan p. was arrested at the end of january at the king cafe in berlin , the suspected hub of the rigging organization , along with his brother after hoyzer named them in his testimony .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .
" our experiences in the cooperation with the iaea , especially in the iran issue , was excellent , " said fischer .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "

but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .
' feasible ' concessions for germany " germany can and will make concessions , " schröder said in a press statement during the luxemburg meeting .
but any compromise has to stay within limits that " have to be financially feasible for germany .
we are n't at that point yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european union flag is seen above the ancient parthenon the decisive question revolves around how much each country has to pay into the communal eu pot .
" we are still far apart on this issue , " schröder said , clearly referring to british discount .

"
both sides will improve cooperation on railway-equipment design and manufacturing , railway lines and equipment maintenance , information technology and other technologies in the sector .
leg up on the competition ?
state media said the agreement signals that germany 's maglev train builder has made a breakthrough in competition for high-speed rail orders from china against its french and japanese rivals .

one burning issue for cologne according to bröhl is urban flight .
young families are leaving cologne to the suburbs yet then commute to the city to work .
in other words , they are taking advantage of the city 's infrastructure without having to pay for it .
" it 's my opinion that tax exemptions for commuting to work should be abolished , " he explained .
but the nrw ju , dominated primarily by groups from the bedroom communities , is in favor of keeping the tax break according to bröhl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban flight is a problem in cologne according to the ju that may be a small chink in the cologne ju 's armor , but the group is proud of recent successes .
in the last three years , membership has doubled .
bröhl pointed out that online interest is rising steadily .
but not everyone feels compelled to join a political party to be politically active .
reaching out the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- in bonn acts an outpost to help young and old alike inform themselves more about how they can more influence the political scene .
in the 1960 's and 70 's , students for the most part , directed their activism towards political institutions .
yet this is no longer the case .
" you ca n't say that young people have given up being politically active , " bpb president thomas krüger said .
" activism is not directed at the institutions , let alone the parties .
it 's project-based .
young people are interested in particular subjects such as the environment or globalization .
research shows that subject-oriented activism is widespread , but with a much less parliamentary aspect .
that is what people have to understand as being politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can also turn to the bpb 's online presence for information krüger grew up in communist east germany and believes the pursuit of democracy is important despite its shortcomings .
political education must be an individual pursuit .
young people should take anything that smacks of indoctrination , political parties included , with a grain of salt .
krüger is absolutely convinced that credibility is the decisive characteristic that today 's youth feel is lacking in politics .
teenagers and those in their 20 's can move things politically .
party politics is one way but as krüger puts it , society and democracy has come to a point , where a different kind of " political being " exists and has to be further cultivated . john kluempers , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .
-lrb- june 6 , 2005 -rrb- conservatism : the new rebellion ?
much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

one burning issue for cologne according to bröhl is urban flight .
young families are leaving cologne to the suburbs yet then commute to the city to work .
in other words , they are taking advantage of the city 's infrastructure without having to pay for it .
" it 's my opinion that tax exemptions for commuting to work should be abolished , " he explained .
but the nrw ju , dominated primarily by groups from the bedroom communities , is in favor of keeping the tax break according to bröhl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban flight is a problem in cologne according to the ju that may be a small chink in the cologne ju 's armor , but the group is proud of recent successes .
in the last three years , membership has doubled .
bröhl pointed out that online interest is rising steadily .
but not everyone feels compelled to join a political party to be politically active .
reaching out the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- in bonn acts an outpost to help young and old alike inform themselves more about how they can more influence the political scene .
in the 1960 's and 70 's , students for the most part , directed their activism towards political institutions .
yet this is no longer the case .
" you ca n't say that young people have given up being politically active , " bpb president thomas krüger said .
" activism is not directed at the institutions , let alone the parties .
it 's project-based .
young people are interested in particular subjects such as the environment or globalization .
research shows that subject-oriented activism is widespread , but with a much less parliamentary aspect .
that is what people have to understand as being politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can also turn to the bpb 's online presence for information krüger grew up in communist east germany and believes the pursuit of democracy is important despite its shortcomings .
political education must be an individual pursuit .
young people should take anything that smacks of indoctrination , political parties included , with a grain of salt .
krüger is absolutely convinced that credibility is the decisive characteristic that today 's youth feel is lacking in politics .
teenagers and those in their 20 's can move things politically .
party politics is one way but as krüger puts it , society and democracy has come to a point , where a different kind of " political being " exists and has to be further cultivated . john kluempers , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .

policies that affect 16 to 30-year olds are not high on the political agenda however .
nevertheless , political and non-political groups are reaching out to them . it was not difficult to pick out ole erdmann out of the small group seated around two tables in bonn 's cafe nyx .
the university student is animated and emanates an air of authority .
most importantly , he exudes optimism , something he and his cohorts in the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- , the youth fraction of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , need .
the defeat of the spd in state elections in north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- on may 22 - after 39 years of rule - sent shock waves throughout the jusos in all of nrw .
a positive spin had to be found .

they will need the new manpower .
nine lost state elections in a row like the social democrats have suffered does not exactly stir up cheerfulness and enthusiasm .
" you have to bring a lot of idealism with you , " said katrin bierwirt who has been a juso member for six years .
a time where she has watched a slow , steady decline of the party 's popularity across the country despite it being in power in berlin .
with the exception of schröder 's reelection in 2002 , victory parties for the spd have been far and few between .
unemployment , tuition worries the most recent unemployment benefits laws , particularly hartz iv , named after peter hartz , the man who helped draw up the legislation and who also is head of personnel at vw , are reason for concern with the jusos .
up until the late 1990 's , germany 's welfare and unemployment recipients lived relatively secure lives .
the sagging economy and huge federal deficits since then have caused the center-left government in berlin to make harsh cuts .
having no job is no longer an option , at least that 's the word from berlin .

hartz iv is a huge problem . "
yet the jusos are n't expecting to see any changes within the labor market .
the hartz laws are fully embedded in schröder 's " agenda 2010 " which is supposed to reform the german labor market and result in a stronger german economy .
where they now will see changes is in the university system .
cdu youth for tuition before being elected in may , the cdu in nrw pledged to introduce tuition fees at the state 's universities .
albeit they are planning a modest 500 euro per semester fee , the junge union -lrb- ju -rrb- , the group for those under 35 in the cdu but predominantly made up of students , thinks the move is long overdue .
german universities suffer from overcrowding and underfunding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to levy tuition fees so that lecture halls at universities can continue to be funded " the fact that we won the state election means that tuition will be introduced at universities in nrw , " said hans-peter bröhl , head of the cologne ju .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .
leadership vacuum but the current state of affairs leaves the eu with a leadership vacuum , said richard whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder and tony blair he added that despite the weakness of europe 's traditional steering axis of germany and france , blair is not in a position to drive the eu along a road more suited to britain .
" france and germany have already lost some their leadership potential because of their behavior over recent years , not least wrecking the stability and growth pact .
they 've lost a lot of good will from smaller member states , " he told the afp news service .
but britain hardly occupies a strong position itself .
" britain is not in the core of the european integration project , not in the euro zone and it does n't have the same relationship to the stability and growth pact , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac stumped hard for the constitution the french believed that the constitution , in opposition to their preferred big-government model , opened the door to right-wing " anglo-saxon " economic liberalism - namely the deregulated markets in public services operating in britain and the united states .
blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .
julie smith , deputy director of the center of international studies at the university of cambridge , also doubted britain could repair the divisions tearing europe apart .
" now is a time to say what are the things that really bind us , what are the things on which we all agree , and how to move forward , " she told afp .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .

berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .

but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .
' feasible ' concessions for germany " germany can and will make concessions , " schröder said in a press statement during the luxemburg meeting .
but any compromise has to stay within limits that " have to be financially feasible for germany .
we are n't at that point yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european union flag is seen above the ancient parthenon the decisive question revolves around how much each country has to pay into the communal eu pot .
" we are still far apart on this issue , " schröder said , clearly referring to british discount .
" we will use our veto if we have to in order to support the british position , " brown replied .
yet if britain fails to give in on this point , the summit planned for next week is liable to run aground .
since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .
the other 24 eu states have demanded that the regulation be done away with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu guenter verheugen and the vice-president of the european commission , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , on wednesday described the british rebate as " unreasonable . "
he said the uk must help to fund the bloc 's enlargement .
" there is absolutely nothing to justify that britain does not pay its part of the costs of enlargement , " verheugen told germany 's zdf television .
britain ' unreasonable ' ?
" i find it really unreasonable that one of the richest countries in europe , and that is what britain is today , is being partly financed by europe 's poorest countries , in other words the new members , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude juncker the current eu council chairman jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- wants to meet with blair on tuesday , to discuss possible solutions to the deadlock ; he plans to make a new compromise offer on wednesday .
juncker once again warned the nations to seek a compromise .
the summit must see to it that " europe does n't sink into a mire " he said , noting the recent french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
aside from the british payment , further discussion continues on the overall disbursements of the eu from 2007 to 2013 .
the eu commission wants a budget of 1.025 trillion euros .
but the union 's main financial contributors germany , sweden , the netherlands , great britain , france and austria , insist on a sum of 815 billion euros .
luxemburg 's suggestion was a compromise of around 870 billion euros .
schröder seeks offensive tact schröder refused to speculate on whether an agreement could be reached .
" i and many of my colleagues agree that , especially now , we ca n't allow the european process to just trickle away , " he said .
rather , he said , eu supporters should take an offensive tact .
and he affirmed germany 's wish to see further expansion in the european union . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.06.2005 getting young germans into politics 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : war protests are n't the only way to get youth politically active early federal elections in germany are around the corner .
policies that affect 16 to 30-year olds are not high on the political agenda however .
nevertheless , political and non-political groups are reaching out to them . it was not difficult to pick out ole erdmann out of the small group seated around two tables in bonn 's cafe nyx .
the university student is animated and emanates an air of authority .
most importantly , he exudes optimism , something he and his cohorts in the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- , the youth fraction of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , need .
the defeat of the spd in state elections in north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- on may 22 - after 39 years of rule - sent shock waves throughout the jusos in all of nrw .
a positive spin had to be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole erdmann " on election evening , four or five people joined , " said erdmann -lrb- photo -rrb- .
they will need the new manpower .
nine lost state elections in a row like the social democrats have suffered does not exactly stir up cheerfulness and enthusiasm .
" you have to bring a lot of idealism with you , " said katrin bierwirt who has been a juso member for six years .
a time where she has watched a slow , steady decline of the party 's popularity across the country despite it being in power in berlin .
with the exception of schröder 's reelection in 2002 , victory parties for the spd have been far and few between .
unemployment , tuition worries the most recent unemployment benefits laws , particularly hartz iv , named after peter hartz , the man who helped draw up the legislation and who also is head of personnel at vw , are reason for concern with the jusos .
up until the late 1990 's , germany 's welfare and unemployment recipients lived relatively secure lives .
the sagging economy and huge federal deficits since then have caused the center-left government in berlin to make harsh cuts .
having no job is no longer an option , at least that 's the word from berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands protested against social welfare cuts in leipzig in 2004 .
nevertheless , they got hartz iv and the cuts in 2005 " if someone graduates from university and is n't sure he 'll find a job , " explained erdmann , " and then is sitting on college tuition debts , which is what the opposition is promoting , then things will be a lot worse .
hartz iv is a huge problem . "
yet the jusos are n't expecting to see any changes within the labor market .
the hartz laws are fully embedded in schröder 's " agenda 2010 " which is supposed to reform the german labor market and result in a stronger german economy .
where they now will see changes is in the university system .
cdu youth for tuition before being elected in may , the cdu in nrw pledged to introduce tuition fees at the state 's universities .
albeit they are planning a modest 500 euro per semester fee , the junge union -lrb- ju -rrb- , the group for those under 35 in the cdu but predominantly made up of students , thinks the move is long overdue .
german universities suffer from overcrowding and underfunding .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu wants to levy tuition fees so that lecture halls at universities can continue to be funded " the fact that we won the state election means that tuition will be introduced at universities in nrw , " said hans-peter bröhl , head of the cologne ju .
" there should be tuition for the duration of studies and repayment would start once the graduate found a job . "

much has been made lately of the idea that teenage " cool " is giving way to a renaissance of conservatism .
but are young germans really seeking the security and stability of anachronistic values over their right to rebel ?

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .

and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .

ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .

" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .

but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .

since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .

but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .
' feasible ' concessions for germany " germany can and will make concessions , " schröder said in a press statement during the luxemburg meeting .
but any compromise has to stay within limits that " have to be financially feasible for germany .
we are n't at that point yet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european union flag is seen above the ancient parthenon the decisive question revolves around how much each country has to pay into the communal eu pot .
" we are still far apart on this issue , " schröder said , clearly referring to british discount .
" we will use our veto if we have to in order to support the british position , " brown replied .
yet if britain fails to give in on this point , the summit planned for next week is liable to run aground .
since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .
the other 24 eu states have demanded that the regulation be done away with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu guenter verheugen and the vice-president of the european commission , günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , on wednesday described the british rebate as " unreasonable . "
he said the uk must help to fund the bloc 's enlargement .
" there is absolutely nothing to justify that britain does not pay its part of the costs of enlargement , " verheugen told germany 's zdf television .
britain ' unreasonable ' ?
" i find it really unreasonable that one of the richest countries in europe , and that is what britain is today , is being partly financed by europe 's poorest countries , in other words the new members , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean claude juncker the current eu council chairman jean-claude juncker -lrb- photo -rrb- wants to meet with blair on tuesday , to discuss possible solutions to the deadlock ; he plans to make a new compromise offer on wednesday .
juncker once again warned the nations to seek a compromise .
the summit must see to it that " europe does n't sink into a mire " he said , noting the recent french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
aside from the british payment , further discussion continues on the overall disbursements of the eu from 2007 to 2013 .
the eu commission wants a budget of 1.025 trillion euros .
but the union 's main financial contributors germany , sweden , the netherlands , great britain , france and austria , insist on a sum of 815 billion euros .
luxemburg 's suggestion was a compromise of around 870 billion euros .
schröder seeks offensive tact schröder refused to speculate on whether an agreement could be reached .
" i and many of my colleagues agree that , especially now , we ca n't allow the european process to just trickle away , " he said .
rather , he said , eu supporters should take an offensive tact .

to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .

they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .

fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .

"
to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .
" with a belief in development and in a new generation of people who can create and enjoy , we call all young people together .
all those who can show their creative motivation belong to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max pechstein 's " junges mädchen " through their work , the artists voiced the thoughts of the anti-bourgeois younger generation , who were starting to move towards the idea of sexual freedom and individual autonomy .
they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .
complete collection by way of celebrating the movement , which was the root of expressionism and one of the most important events in the art history of the 20th century , the exhibition in berlin is showing a collection of 300 early prints , never before shown in their entirety .

kirchner experimented a great deal with color at the beginning , making unique prints of the same image with different colors .
fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .
from art nouveau to neo impressionism , from van gogh to munch and matisse to gaugin 's images from the south seas , it is all there for the trained eye to see .
collective brücke style otto mueller , who joined die brücke in 1910 , is represented in the exhibition with bathing pictures , which date back to the days when the group spent long summer holidays deep in the nature surrounding dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " zwei mädchen am wasser " by erich heckel they played with their idea of harmonious unity between art and life and used the viertelstundenakte , in which models changed their pose every fifteen minutes in order to maximise the life element of a situation , to clearly show their new found self-image , which peaked in an almost collective brücke style in 1910 and 1911 .
the group eventually moved from dresden to berlin , where a new manifesto drawn up by ernst ludwig kirchner sent them scattering in different directions .

one burning issue for cologne according to bröhl is urban flight .
young families are leaving cologne to the suburbs yet then commute to the city to work .
in other words , they are taking advantage of the city 's infrastructure without having to pay for it .
" it 's my opinion that tax exemptions for commuting to work should be abolished , " he explained .
but the nrw ju , dominated primarily by groups from the bedroom communities , is in favor of keeping the tax break according to bröhl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban flight is a problem in cologne according to the ju that may be a small chink in the cologne ju 's armor , but the group is proud of recent successes .
in the last three years , membership has doubled .
bröhl pointed out that online interest is rising steadily .
but not everyone feels compelled to join a political party to be politically active .
reaching out the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- in bonn acts an outpost to help young and old alike inform themselves more about how they can more influence the political scene .
in the 1960 's and 70 's , students for the most part , directed their activism towards political institutions .
yet this is no longer the case .
" you ca n't say that young people have given up being politically active , " bpb president thomas krüger said .
" activism is not directed at the institutions , let alone the parties .
it 's project-based .
young people are interested in particular subjects such as the environment or globalization .

a german sex psychologist says more and more people are calling their true loves by a " pet " name - which is only appropriate , when their partners are pooches .
inanimate objects are also popular ersatz mates . remember the love boat ?

german sex psychologist and researcher volkmar sigusch sees a trend toward people having love ties to inanimate objects - such as a boat - or to house pets , as well as having no emotional ties at all .

" we live in a situation where things that were once proscribed or embarrassing or shameful can now be expressed , " he said .
" today we talk about things that used to be hidden . "
two of the trends he sees are towards asexuality - where for varied reasons people show no sexual desire at all - and objectophilia , a sexual obsession with objects or house pets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i pronounce you man and bitch " : dog weddings are not unheard of in florida in his book , sigusch describes a woman whose love life gave new meaning to the term partner-ship when she fell in love with a ferry .

she was " enraptured like one in love , " he wrote .
the scientist also considers people to be objectophiles who treat their pets - mostly cats and dogs , but sometimes lizards - like beloved partners .
they hug and kiss them , spoil them , take them on vacation , dress them up - even send them to spas or summer camps .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .
" our experiences in the cooperation with the iaea , especially in the iran issue , was excellent , " said fischer .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2005 interview : lebedev feels shame for judges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebedev -lrb- right -rrb- and khordokovsky -lrb- left -rrb- during the trial platon lebedev was recently sentenced to nine years in a labor camp , along with his business partner and former russian oil magnate , mikhail khodorkovsky .
read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .
and i was not the only one .
this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .
doctors in the lefortovo prison also confirmed that my health condition was fine , even though i was arrested while in hospital , and , finally , the court itself stated in the verdict that i suffered from chronic hepatitis . what do you think about the sentence ? i see the sentence as an assessment of the degree to which i am considered to be a danger and a threat to the interests of degraded and corrupt bureaucrats . … and the position and conduct of the judges ? i feel shame for the judges and their conduct .
they have no right to be judges , let alone be addressed with " your honor . " what , in your mind , is the main reason for initiating the " yukos affair " ? fear and envy . what do you think about the conditions in the prison ?
how are you treated by the prison personnel ?
are you allowed to see your relatives ? no comment .
you will learn everything from the european human rights court . how do you occupy yourself in prison ? i 'm protecting myself , trying to protect others , and trying to live somehow . do you ever wish you were somewhere far away from russia ? never .
a criminal government is one thing , the country is another . what 's your assessment of the current political situation in russia ? it 's unpredictable and possibly explosive . can you read russian and foreign press ? i could in the past , now i ca n't . how do you assess the journalists covering your process ? variously . do you think that there is hope for a positive outcome in the case against you and mikhail khodorkovsky ? on my part , i will do everything possible and even try to do the impossible for a positive outcome , not just for mikhail 's and my sake , but also for our country 's sake .
as philosophers like to put it : there is always hope , and hope dies last . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans criticize khordorkovsky verdict german politicians on tuesday condemned the jailing of yukos oil founder mikhail khordorkovsky , who was convicted of fraud and tax evasion by a russian court .

read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .
and i was not the only one .
this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .
doctors in the lefortovo prison also confirmed that my health condition was fine , even though i was arrested while in hospital , and , finally , the court itself stated in the verdict that i suffered from chronic hepatitis . what do you think about the sentence ? i see the sentence as an assessment of the degree to which i am considered to be a danger and a threat to the interests of degraded and corrupt bureaucrats . … and the position and conduct of the judges ? i feel shame for the judges and their conduct .
they have no right to be judges , let alone be addressed with " your honor . " what , in your mind , is the main reason for initiating the " yukos affair " ? fear and envy . what do you think about the conditions in the prison ?
how are you treated by the prison personnel ?
are you allowed to see your relatives ? no comment .
you will learn everything from the european human rights court . how do you occupy yourself in prison ? i 'm protecting myself , trying to protect others , and trying to live somehow . do you ever wish you were somewhere far away from russia ? never .
a criminal government is one thing , the country is another . what 's your assessment of the current political situation in russia ? it 's unpredictable and possibly explosive . can you read russian and foreign press ? i could in the past , now i ca n't . how do you assess the journalists covering your process ? variously . do you think that there is hope for a positive outcome in the case against you and mikhail khodorkovsky ? on my part , i will do everything possible and even try to do the impossible for a positive outcome , not just for mikhail 's and my sake , but also for our country 's sake .

"
both sides will improve cooperation on railway-equipment design and manufacturing , railway lines and equipment maintenance , information technology and other technologies in the sector .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .

blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .

one burning issue for cologne according to bröhl is urban flight .
young families are leaving cologne to the suburbs yet then commute to the city to work .
in other words , they are taking advantage of the city 's infrastructure without having to pay for it .
" it 's my opinion that tax exemptions for commuting to work should be abolished , " he explained .
but the nrw ju , dominated primarily by groups from the bedroom communities , is in favor of keeping the tax break according to bröhl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban flight is a problem in cologne according to the ju that may be a small chink in the cologne ju 's armor , but the group is proud of recent successes .
in the last three years , membership has doubled .
bröhl pointed out that online interest is rising steadily .
but not everyone feels compelled to join a political party to be politically active .
reaching out the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- in bonn acts an outpost to help young and old alike inform themselves more about how they can more influence the political scene .
in the 1960 's and 70 's , students for the most part , directed their activism towards political institutions .
yet this is no longer the case .
" you ca n't say that young people have given up being politically active , " bpb president thomas krüger said .
" activism is not directed at the institutions , let alone the parties .
it 's project-based .
young people are interested in particular subjects such as the environment or globalization .

"
to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .
" with a belief in development and in a new generation of people who can create and enjoy , we call all young people together .
all those who can show their creative motivation belong to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max pechstein 's " junges mädchen " through their work , the artists voiced the thoughts of the anti-bourgeois younger generation , who were starting to move towards the idea of sexual freedom and individual autonomy .
they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .
complete collection by way of celebrating the movement , which was the root of expressionism and one of the most important events in the art history of the 20th century , the exhibition in berlin is showing a collection of 300 early prints , never before shown in their entirety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ernst ludwig kirchner , czardastänzerinnen , 1908/1920 " through the gifts from erich heckel and karl schmidt-rottluff , we have a whole series of very rare copies .
kirchner experimented a great deal with color at the beginning , making unique prints of the same image with different colors .
fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .
from art nouveau to neo impressionism , from van gogh to munch and matisse to gaugin 's images from the south seas , it is all there for the trained eye to see .
collective brücke style otto mueller , who joined die brücke in 1910 , is represented in the exhibition with bathing pictures , which date back to the days when the group spent long summer holidays deep in the nature surrounding dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " zwei mädchen am wasser " by erich heckel they played with their idea of harmonious unity between art and life and used the viertelstundenakte , in which models changed their pose every fifteen minutes in order to maximise the life element of a situation , to clearly show their new found self-image , which peaked in an almost collective brücke style in 1910 and 1911 .
the group eventually moved from dresden to berlin , where a new manifesto drawn up by ernst ludwig kirchner sent them scattering in different directions .
but now they are back together in the capital 's neue nationalgalerie , and can be viewed there until 2nd october . ute büsing -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german painter provokes with " aryan art " german painter norbert bisky has been criticized for toying with the aestheticism of fascism .

"
to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .
their founding manifesto contained a clear message for them and anyone who cared to listen .
" with a belief in development and in a new generation of people who can create and enjoy , we call all young people together .
all those who can show their creative motivation belong to us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max pechstein 's " junges mädchen " through their work , the artists voiced the thoughts of the anti-bourgeois younger generation , who were starting to move towards the idea of sexual freedom and individual autonomy .
they began with old-fashioned techniques such as woodcuts , but in keeping with their lust for liberation , used them to depict images of naked men and women .
complete collection by way of celebrating the movement , which was the root of expressionism and one of the most important events in the art history of the 20th century , the exhibition in berlin is showing a collection of 300 early prints , never before shown in their entirety .

fritz bleyl created very delicate woodcuts , and then in 1906 emil nolde joined die brücke - and introduced the others to etchings , " exhibition director magdalena moeller said .
although the brücke artists followed the principles of uniqueness , the collection on show in berlin is testimony to the rich influences which fed into their work .
from art nouveau to neo impressionism , from van gogh to munch and matisse to gaugin 's images from the south seas , it is all there for the trained eye to see .
collective brücke style otto mueller , who joined die brücke in 1910 , is represented in the exhibition with bathing pictures , which date back to the days when the group spent long summer holidays deep in the nature surrounding dresden .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .

both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .

" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .
" our experiences in the cooperation with the iaea , especially in the iran issue , was excellent , " said fischer .
" so i have no reasons to complain . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer heads to us to push un reform german foreign minister joschka fischer will hold talks in washington on wednesday with secretary of state condoleezza rice .

but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .

" we will use our veto if we have to in order to support the british position , " brown replied .
yet if britain fails to give in on this point , the summit planned for next week is liable to run aground .
since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .

the summit must see to it that " europe does n't sink into a mire " he said , noting the recent french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .
aside from the british payment , further discussion continues on the overall disbursements of the eu from 2007 to 2013 .

but the union 's main financial contributors germany , sweden , the netherlands , great britain , france and austria , insist on a sum of 815 billion euros .
luxemburg 's suggestion was a compromise of around 870 billion euros .
schröder seeks offensive tact schröder refused to speculate on whether an agreement could be reached .

green parliamentarian volker beck said that pope benedict xvi ’ s attitude toward homosexuality was “ marked by theological mercilessness and the haughtiness of the pharisees . ” manfred burns , spokesperson for the lesbian and gay federation , called benedict ’ s remarks on monday an “ insulting sermon of hate . ” benedict had told italian catholics that gay marriage involved a “ trivialization of the human body . ” “ gay marriage is an expression of an anarchic freedom , which falsely tries to pass itself off as the true liberation of man ... man is not just his body , and that which is biological , is not just biological , but an expression and fulfillment of his humanity , ” the pope said . continuing john paul ii 's mission benedict ’ s position is not radically different from his predecessor ’ s , pope john paul ii : although gay marriage is theologically unfounded , discrimination against gays is also sinful .
john paul was the heavy target of criticism by the lesbian and gay federation .
it called on german bishops to distance themselves from the john paul ’ s ideas on homosexuality in his last book , memory and identity , which the gay advocacy organization called “ inhuman writings . ” until now , german political groups have been careful not to criticize benedict xvi publicly .
although many germans disagree with his stance on issues regarding sexuality , public sympathy has been strong for benedict , the first german pope since 1523 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one could n't see the rainbow flag waving for the new pope since he took office almost two months ago , benedict has not focused his speeches on sexuality , but rather on encouraging peace between nations and reaching out toward protestantism and non-christian religions .
those ideas are not controversial among many western european catholics ; but in issues of sexuality , their attitudes tend statistically , world-wide , to be more libertarian . many catholic voices in the german media had expressed hope that benedict would deviate from his predecessor ’ s line on gay marriage , contraception , abortion , and other sexual issues .
but monday ’ s speech , and the reaction to it , appear to signal no change in the frustration among gay advocacy groups with the pope ’ s conservative views on sexuality and social issues . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain approves gay marriage , adoption days after the election of a staunchly conservative new pope , predominantly roman catholic spain is set to allow homosexuals to marry and adopt children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.06.2005 interview : lebedev feels shame for judges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebedev -lrb- right -rrb- and khordokovsky -lrb- left -rrb- during the trial platon lebedev was recently sentenced to nine years in a labor camp , along with his business partner and former russian oil magnate , mikhail khodorkovsky .
read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .
and i was not the only one .
this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .
doctors in the lefortovo prison also confirmed that my health condition was fine , even though i was arrested while in hospital , and , finally , the court itself stated in the verdict that i suffered from chronic hepatitis . what do you think about the sentence ? i see the sentence as an assessment of the degree to which i am considered to be a danger and a threat to the interests of degraded and corrupt bureaucrats . … and the position and conduct of the judges ? i feel shame for the judges and their conduct .
they have no right to be judges , let alone be addressed with " your honor . " what , in your mind , is the main reason for initiating the " yukos affair " ? fear and envy . what do you think about the conditions in the prison ?
how are you treated by the prison personnel ?
are you allowed to see your relatives ? no comment .
you will learn everything from the european human rights court . how do you occupy yourself in prison ? i 'm protecting myself , trying to protect others , and trying to live somehow . do you ever wish you were somewhere far away from russia ? never .
a criminal government is one thing , the country is another . what 's your assessment of the current political situation in russia ? it 's unpredictable and possibly explosive . can you read russian and foreign press ? i could in the past , now i ca n't . how do you assess the journalists covering your process ? variously . do you think that there is hope for a positive outcome in the case against you and mikhail khodorkovsky ? on my part , i will do everything possible and even try to do the impossible for a positive outcome , not just for mikhail 's and my sake , but also for our country 's sake .

read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .

this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .
doctors in the lefortovo prison also confirmed that my health condition was fine , even though i was arrested while in hospital , and , finally , the court itself stated in the verdict that i suffered from chronic hepatitis . what do you think about the sentence ? i see the sentence as an assessment of the degree to which i am considered to be a danger and a threat to the interests of degraded and corrupt bureaucrats . … and the position and conduct of the judges ? i feel shame for the judges and their conduct .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .
leadership vacuum but the current state of affairs leaves the eu with a leadership vacuum , said richard whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder and tony blair he added that despite the weakness of europe 's traditional steering axis of germany and france , blair is not in a position to drive the eu along a road more suited to britain .
" france and germany have already lost some their leadership potential because of their behavior over recent years , not least wrecking the stability and growth pact .
they 've lost a lot of good will from smaller member states , " he told the afp news service .
but britain hardly occupies a strong position itself .
" britain is not in the core of the european integration project , not in the euro zone and it does n't have the same relationship to the stability and growth pact , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac stumped hard for the constitution the french believed that the constitution , in opposition to their preferred big-government model , opened the door to right-wing " anglo-saxon " economic liberalism - namely the deregulated markets in public services operating in britain and the united states .
blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .
julie smith , deputy director of the center of international studies at the university of cambridge , also doubted britain could repair the divisions tearing europe apart .

but after dropping plans monday for a referendum on the eu constitution , london may have difficulty healing growing rifts on the continent . when prime minister tony blair becomes chairman of the six-month rotating european union presidency on july 1 , he risks being painted as the man who killed off hopes of resurrecting the constitution , analysts said .
yet trouble could come even earlier , when blair travels to brussels for a june 16-17 summit of eu states , including france and germany .
berlin urged the 25-nation bloc to continue the process of ratifying the constitution , but britain ignored the pleas .
british foreign secretary jack straw said monday his government would not proceed with a referendum until the dust had settled from the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters last week .
parts of the european union constitution could be introduced without a referendum in britain , straw said tuesday . in an attempt to bolster efforts by blair to calm the political storm sweeping europe over the eu constitution , straw said the charter was not dead despite the decision taken by britain .
leadership vacuum but the current state of affairs leaves the eu with a leadership vacuum , said richard whitman , who heads the european program at the royal institute of international affairs in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder and tony blair he added that despite the weakness of europe 's traditional steering axis of germany and france , blair is not in a position to drive the eu along a road more suited to britain .
" france and germany have already lost some their leadership potential because of their behavior over recent years , not least wrecking the stability and growth pact .
they 've lost a lot of good will from smaller member states , " he told the afp news service .
but britain hardly occupies a strong position itself .
" britain is not in the core of the european integration project , not in the euro zone and it does n't have the same relationship to the stability and growth pact , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac stumped hard for the constitution the french believed that the constitution , in opposition to their preferred big-government model , opened the door to right-wing " anglo-saxon " economic liberalism - namely the deregulated markets in public services operating in britain and the united states .
blair unlikely to push observers believe blair will not seize the chance to guide the eu in that direction as he assumes the presidency .
" absolutely not , because much of the opposition in the netherlands and france came from people on the left , " said patrick dunleavy , a politics professor at the london school of economics .
" i do n't see how pushing an agenda that contributed powerfully to two referendum defeats would be a positive thing to do .
that 's not to say that it wo n't be tried , " he added .
julie smith , deputy director of the center of international studies at the university of cambridge , also doubted britain could repair the divisions tearing europe apart .
" now is a time to say what are the things that really bind us , what are the things on which we all agree , and how to move forward , " she told afp .
" unfortunately the -lrb- british -rrb- agenda is not one of those things that binds us .
the more -lrb- blair -rrb- tries to push that the less he is going to influence the union effectively .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .

cycling in the nude , the karlsruhe court ruled , is " highly inconvenient . "
the group of 12 naturists were planning to cycle along the rhine in the state of baden-württemberg on saturday as part of what they were dubbing " world nude cycling day . "
the court upheld an earlier decision from the local authorities to ban the ride .
it said that cycling in the nude contravened the unwritten rules of public decency .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .
" our experiences in the cooperation with the iaea , especially in the iran issue , was excellent , " said fischer .

3 .
the decision to start the negotiations was final , but the negotiation framework still had to be determined , and the decision about it had to be reached unanimously . abandoning talks with ankara " would carry considerable risk , " said fischer after a meeting with us security advisor stephan hadley . both the proponents and the opponents of the turkish entry into the eu agree about turkey 's strategic importance for european security .
they also agree that turkey still needs to undergo a long modernization process with the help of european countries . the difference between the two camps lies in the way they see the outcome of the negotiations as either a full membership or " something which already exists today , namely a privileged partnership , " fischer said . no automatic membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkey be the first predominantly muslim nation to join eu ?
taking into account opposition to turkey 's eu membership , fischer said that at any rate a decision on turkey 's membership would come at the conclusion of accession talks and only after a " europe-capable " turkey has come into existence . the decision would come " within 15 years at the earliest , " he said . fischer also connected the turkish question with the developments in the near and middle east as well as the iran nuclear weapons policy . " i do not understand why anyone would give that up , unless one was blind and reckless about european security interests , " he said . some eu officials said dutch and french rejection of the eu constitution meant an end to eu enlargement .
the us , on the other hand , is concerned about the possible repercussions the european constitutional crisis may have on the role which eu currently plays as a stabilizing factor in the balkan region . fischer underscored that the eu would remain active on the world stage .
in view of the negotiations about the final status of kosovo , according to fisher , this was a " decisive year . " similarly to the turkish model , the eu balkan strategy is based on offering balkan countries the possibility of joining the eu after they have met a set of necessary conditions . us giving up opposition meanwhile , the united states signaled wednesday that it was open to a third term for un atomic agency chief mohamed elbaradei , but stopped short of endorsing a new mandate outright . secretary of state condoleezza rice said washington had worked well with elbaradei in the past and she looked forward to talks on the future with the head of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- here thursday . elbaradei has clashed with the united states over iraq 's weapons capability and his handling of iran 's nuclear program .
but diplomats in vienna said the americans had given up trying to deny him a new , four-year term . " we do have a long-held view that in general it is better that there be two terms for these positions , " rice told reporters after talks here wednesday with fischer .
" nonetheless , we have worked well with dr. elbaradei in the past .
and i 'm going to meet him tomorrow to discuss his vision for what the iaea will do in these next extremely important years . "
rice did not explicitly say the united states would drop its opposition to a new term for elbaradei , who has served as iaea director general since 1997 and is the only candidate before the body 's board of governors . fischer was less nuanced .

to mark the occasion , berlin is staging the exhibition " brücke and berlin - 100 years of expressionism . " in 1905 four architect students , ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz bleyl , erich heckel and karl schmidt rottluff , joined forces in a bid to find new forms of artistic expression which would liberate them from the constraints of the then predominant academic style .

one burning issue for cologne according to bröhl is urban flight .
young families are leaving cologne to the suburbs yet then commute to the city to work .
in other words , they are taking advantage of the city 's infrastructure without having to pay for it .
" it 's my opinion that tax exemptions for commuting to work should be abolished , " he explained .
but the nrw ju , dominated primarily by groups from the bedroom communities , is in favor of keeping the tax break according to bröhl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban flight is a problem in cologne according to the ju that may be a small chink in the cologne ju 's armor , but the group is proud of recent successes .
in the last three years , membership has doubled .
bröhl pointed out that online interest is rising steadily .
but not everyone feels compelled to join a political party to be politically active .
reaching out the federal center for political education -lrb- bpb -rrb- in bonn acts an outpost to help young and old alike inform themselves more about how they can more influence the political scene .
in the 1960 's and 70 's , students for the most part , directed their activism towards political institutions .
yet this is no longer the case .
" you ca n't say that young people have given up being politically active , " bpb president thomas krüger said .
" activism is not directed at the institutions , let alone the parties .
it 's project-based .
young people are interested in particular subjects such as the environment or globalization .
research shows that subject-oriented activism is widespread , but with a much less parliamentary aspect .
that is what people have to understand as being politically active today . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people can also turn to the bpb 's online presence for information krüger grew up in communist east germany and believes the pursuit of democracy is important despite its shortcomings .
political education must be an individual pursuit .
young people should take anything that smacks of indoctrination , political parties included , with a grain of salt .
krüger is absolutely convinced that credibility is the decisive characteristic that today 's youth feel is lacking in politics .
teenagers and those in their 20 's can move things politically .
party politics is one way but as krüger puts it , society and democracy has come to a point , where a different kind of " political being " exists and has to be further cultivated . john kluempers , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .

policies that affect 16 to 30-year olds are not high on the political agenda however .

most importantly , he exudes optimism , something he and his cohorts in the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- , the youth fraction of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , need .
the defeat of the spd in state elections in north-rhine westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- on may 22 - after 39 years of rule - sent shock waves throughout the jusos in all of nrw .

hartz iv is a huge problem . "
yet the jusos are n't expecting to see any changes within the labor market .
the hartz laws are fully embedded in schröder 's " agenda 2010 " which is supposed to reform the german labor market and result in a stronger german economy .
where they now will see changes is in the university system .
cdu youth for tuition before being elected in may , the cdu in nrw pledged to introduce tuition fees at the state 's universities .

his testimony suggests the crime ring stretches to turkey and beyond . it could be the case of the one that got away .
the croat , known only as milan p. , a suspect in the german match-fixing scandal , was released from custody on tuesday after four months detention despite being the connection between germany 's biggest sporting scandal and an international crime ring rigging soccer matches all over the continent and beyond . the 39-year old , the proprietor of berlins king cafe - the front for a betting manipulation ring that was exposed last year - was released by the berlin public prosecutor 's office after a three and a half hour review of his case .
it is believed that information he passed to investigators helped smooth his release . match rigging scandal with international scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and turkey are just two countries which could be linked by the scandal milan p. and his brother ante could be the connection between a spate of match fixing and referee manipulation in the german bundesliga and a wider network of rigged betting offences . the croat is said to have admitted to traveling to turkey in 2004 to bribe a midfield player and another colleague at the turkish super league club mke ankaragücü to throw a game against galatasary istanbul for 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 18,000 -rrb- .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .
and fdp leader guido westerwelle has repeatedly said the liberals would not support raising the vat . most politicians in germany agree germany , which has one of the most complicated tax systems in the world , could use a major tax reform .
" we need a serious structural modernization of the tax code , " said cdu tax expert peter rzepka , adding a " grand vision " could help the country 's mood and strengthen its efforts to spark growth . however , the big question is how any tax reform might be paid for - and that 's something few people agree upon .
not even all the conservatives , the main supporters of a vat hike , believe any hike will finance itself . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cracking down on tax evaders as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .
but according to the fdp finance expert ludwig thiele , the goal has to be an overall lowering of the tax burden in germany .

better get that david hasselhoff cd now politicians generally shy away from talking about raising taxes ahead of an election .
but as germany heads toward an early vote this fall , talk about hiking the country 's value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- is making the rounds . the prospect must be extremely seductive german politicians faced with an ever-widening budget deficit : currently , germany 's 16 percent vat , a general consumption tax on goods and services , filled the government 's coffers last year with 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 171 billion -rrb- .
by raising it only one percentage point , another 8 billion euros would head towards the treasury . at the same time , social security costs on workers ' wages could be cut in an effort to lower germany 's rather high labor costs .
ideally , that would let germany follow the example of scandinavian nations that have solid economic growth and lower unemployment . germany 's vat is currently under the european average .
denmark , sweden and hungary are at the high end with 25 percent and only tiny luxembourg and cyprus charge less at 15 percent . regardless of the international comparison , germans are still likely uneager to see the vat raised in the near future .
but that does n't bother christian democratic mp steffen kampeter .
" now is n't the time to make gifts , " he said , adding that politicians needed to come clean with voters before the election and tell that things ca n't continue on as they are . scaring voters ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel conservative governors from several german states have even started to openly discuss raising the vat by up to four percentage points .
the national leadership of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , however , continues to play its cards closer to the chest .
both the conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel and cdu secretary-general volker kauder fear voters could be scared off by a premature debate about tax hikes .
but they have refused to rule out the possibility of raising the vat and kauder has repeatedly said the conservatives will take a holistic view of what the country needs . the ruling center-let coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens , sensing a possible weakness , have gone on the attack over the conservatives ' tax talk .
joachim poß , deputy parliamentary leader for the spd , said average germans will be the losers .
" hike the vat , slash the tax write-offs for workers and then cut the highest tax rate for the privileged few - that 's what will happen if the cdu / csu and fdp win early elections , " he said . but it would n't be quite that simply .
although the spd and greens overwhelmingly oppose raising the vat - which started out at 10 percent in 1968 - the cdu and the smaller free market free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are divided over the matter . liberals oppose hike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the fdp has long pleaded for a radical tax reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.06.2005 -pipe- 09:00 utc daimlerchrysler unveils new car daimlerchrysler unveiled a ' bionic ' diesel-powered concept car tuesday that would vastly improve fuel economy while meeting strict pollution standards .
the german-us automaker also confirmed it would be investing $ 40 billion -lrb- 32.4 billion euros -rrb- in north america over the next five years to introduce new models and upgrade its facilities .
at a company-sponsored technology symposium in washington , top executives of the auto giant introduced the car using a " boxfish " shape to improve aerodynamics and a diesel engine that would meet tough us emission standards in all 50 states , a spokesman said .
the mercedes-benz concept car would increase the fuel economy advantage of diesel , getting 70 miles -lrb- 112 kilometers -rrb- to the gallon -lrb- 3.8 liters -rrb- , daimlerchrysler said .
in the eu driving cycle , the concept car had a fuel consumption of 4.3 liters per 100 kilometers .
separately , sources close to daimlerchrysler ag and general motors said the two firms would each invest up to $ 500 million dollars in a joint venture to develop a two-mode hybrid propulsion system .
the sources added that the joint venture development center will be set up in troy , michigan , and that other german carmakers are interested in joining the joint venture project with gm . dw-world.de weak dollar unnerves german car giants german auto manufacturers are facing the prospect of having their us profits from imported models slashed due to the weak performance of the dollar .

read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .
and i was not the only one .
this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .
doctors in the lefortovo prison also confirmed that my health condition was fine , even though i was arrested while in hospital , and , finally , the court itself stated in the verdict that i suffered from chronic hepatitis . what do you think about the sentence ? i see the sentence as an assessment of the degree to which i am considered to be a danger and a threat to the interests of degraded and corrupt bureaucrats . … and the position and conduct of the judges ? i feel shame for the judges and their conduct .
they have no right to be judges , let alone be addressed with " your honor . " what , in your mind , is the main reason for initiating the " yukos affair " ? fear and envy . what do you think about the conditions in the prison ?
how are you treated by the prison personnel ?

read dw-world 's exclusive interview with him . dw-world : what do you think about the trial and the verdict passed by the moscow municipal court ? platon lebedev : i already said what i though about the trial , after the verdict was passed .
i said that that was a crime and that the judges had lost their honor . are you talking about the guilty verdict and its argumentation ? as far as the argumentation of the verdict is concerned , i have spoken on more than one occasion , and my assessment and position never changed .
on april 16 , 2004 , i spoke about the charges pressed against me at the very beginning of the process .
i pointed more than once to the crimes committed by officials involved in falsifying charges against me . i do n't think one should use the word " arguments " to describe the conclusions reached in the verdict because they were both mendacious and unintelligent , to such a degree , that i found myself having to laugh during the proceedings .
and i was not the only one .
this is a fact : when the court itself is laughing about its arguments , what more could one say ? a good example for the " arguments " of the government is the fact that mr. putin , after i was arrested , announced in the states that i was in " excellent health , " referring to the words of state prosecutor ustinov .
doctors in the lefortovo prison also confirmed that my health condition was fine , even though i was arrested while in hospital , and , finally , the court itself stated in the verdict that i suffered from chronic hepatitis . what do you think about the sentence ? i see the sentence as an assessment of the degree to which i am considered to be a danger and a threat to the interests of degraded and corrupt bureaucrats . … and the position and conduct of the judges ? i feel shame for the judges and their conduct .
they have no right to be judges , let alone be addressed with " your honor . " what , in your mind , is the main reason for initiating the " yukos affair " ? fear and envy . what do you think about the conditions in the prison ?
how are you treated by the prison personnel ?
are you allowed to see your relatives ? no comment .
you will learn everything from the european human rights court . how do you occupy yourself in prison ? i 'm protecting myself , trying to protect others , and trying to live somehow . do you ever wish you were somewhere far away from russia ? never .
a criminal government is one thing , the country is another . what 's your assessment of the current political situation in russia ? it 's unpredictable and possibly explosive . can you read russian and foreign press ? i could in the past , now i ca n't . how do you assess the journalists covering your process ? variously . do you think that there is hope for a positive outcome in the case against you and mikhail khodorkovsky ? on my part , i will do everything possible and even try to do the impossible for a positive outcome , not just for mikhail 's and my sake , but also for our country 's sake .

just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .

since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .

the summit must see to it that " europe does n't sink into a mire " he said , noting the recent french and dutch rejections of the eu constitution .

but resistance from britain may make that impossible .
just one week before a decisive eu summit on june 16 and 17 , players the front lines in the debate over the european union 's mid-term financial planning have entrenched themselves in their positions .
uk brandishes veto threat despite a looming constitutional crisis , great britain is holding tight to its veto threat , which it says it will use to secure the continued reduced fees it currently pays into eu coffers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown " our position has n't changed , " british finance minister gordon brown -lrb- photo -rrb- said at a meeting with his eu colleagues on tuesday in luxemburg .
schröder , for his part , warned while he is willing to make concessions to toward compromise with his eu partners , they wo n't be too extreme .
' feasible ' concessions for germany " germany can and will make concessions , " schröder said in a press statement during the luxemburg meeting .
but any compromise has to stay within limits that " have to be financially feasible for germany .

" we will use our veto if we have to in order to support the british position , " brown replied .
yet if britain fails to give in on this point , the summit planned for next week is liable to run aground .
since 1984 , britain has been allowed to pay a reduced amount toward the eu budget , totalling some 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.6 billion -rrb- per year .
the initial reason for this was that there were significantly fewer farmers to receive eu subsidies in britain than in other eu nations .
but since these subsidies have been falling for years , the discount is widely considered to be inappropriate .
the other 24 eu states have demanded that the regulation be done away with .

" we live in a situation where things that were once proscribed or embarrassing or shameful can now be expressed , " he said .
" today we talk about things that used to be hidden . "
two of the trends he sees are towards asexuality - where for varied reasons people show no sexual desire at all - and objectophilia , a sexual obsession with objects or house pets .

she was " enraptured like one in love , " he wrote .
the scientist also considers people to be objectophiles who treat their pets - mostly cats and dogs , but sometimes lizards - like beloved partners .
they hug and kiss them , spoil them , take them on vacation , dress them up - even send them to spas or summer camps .

the move , officially announced at the apple worldwide developers conference on monday , could mean people hold off buying new apple laptops .
apple said it was making the move to x86 architecture chips because they offer more power and better efficiency .
the first apple computers with intel chips will be on the market next year .
that is likely to be the mac mini , with the entire product line switching by the end of 2007 .
applications will continue to work on both types of chip-sets for some years .
but graham barlow , editor of macformat magazine , said some people may not buy a new apple machine knowing that a new processor was coming out next year .
" that must be the worry for apple retailers .
i think it 's highly likely there will be some price drops to tempt people to buy the final stocks of powerpc equipped macs , " he told the bbc news website .
apple has sent a strong signal that it would be sensible to wait a year if you want to buy a new powerbook gary barnett , ovum one main motivation behind the switch is because ibm has not yet been able to produce versions of the g5 chip , used in apple 's desktop g5 machines , which are suitable for apple laptops without overheating .
intel is the world 's largest semiconductor company .
ibm and motorola -lrb- now freescale semiconductor -rrb- have been providing powerpc chips to apple for more than a decade .
the announcement has come as a bolt out of the blue to many , and experts say it is one of the biggest transitions in the mac market since the move from os 9 to os x operating systems .
hold off ?
some analysts have suggested that the transition could further damage apple 's low 2.3 % worldwide market share , while others say it is a logical decision .
others worry that it is a big gamble for apple because it might create consumer confusion , and could damage support from a loyal cohort of mac users .
gary barnett , research director at technology analysts ovum , said he was puzzled by the move and had been watching the reaction on internet newsgroup discussion forums .
" one poster was debating whether to upgrade his powerbook or to go on holiday - there was no point in him buying a powerbook if it was going to be obsolete in 18 months ' time , " he told the bbc news website .
apple may have lost the war for the office environment to windows , but it wants to win the next war - the battle for control of your digital entertainment graham barlow , macformat " apple has sent a strong signal that it would be sensible to wait a year if you want to buy a new powerbook . "
apple said the change gets around issues it has previously had with chip supplies , as well as the power versus heat problems it has with ibm chips .
but , added mr barnett , the move was confusing because ibm 's powerpc was about to be produced in huge volumes because of its deal to provide the microprocessors for the next-generation of microsoft , nintendo and sony games consoles .
its openpower initiative , aimed at device manufacturers , was gaining headway too .
it is aimed at improving the market presence of the power architecture through open standards development .
mr barnett said he would have been more impressed if apple had decided to switch to amd processors instead .
amd had " out-innovated " intel in terms of its 64 processor technology , he said .
" everything around powerpc seems to interesting and optimistic - amd can be classified as that too .
intel is just the current leader , albeit it by a big margin . "
next war but there was no doubt that the move would have a significant impact on software vendors .
a lot depends on getting the mac developers on side at an early stage .
the company announced on monday the release of the developer transition kit with an intel-based mac development system and preview versions of apple 's software .
it will let developers prepare versions of their applications which will run on both powerpc and intel-based macs .
powerpc will be in all the main next-generations games consoles macformat magazine 's mr barlow said reaction from mac users had been mixed , from " hell has frozen over " to " apple 's transition has come full circle " .
" of course , people 's fears are that their macs will become obsolete when the new range of intel-based macs come out in 2006 , " he said .
" but ultimately it means faster macs and more choice for the consumer , which is a good thing . "
others think the move shows that processor brand is becoming increasingly irrelevant .
mr barlow added that it would open a plethora of opportunities for apple in the computing market .
" apple may have lost the war for the office environment to windows , but it wants to win the next war - the battle for control of your digital entertainment , " he said .
" with the ipod and itunes music store it already owns most of the digital audio market , but it 's going to need new devices and new technology to get control of the emerging downloadable movie market too .
" these are the kind of possibilities that the intel chips provide with their low power consumption and built-in digital rights management . "
it could also pave the way for the quicker adoption of wimax - ultra fast wireless net connectivity which intel is touting and other developments in wireless portable devices .
apple previewed a version of mac os x tiger , running on an intel-based mac , to more than 3,800 developers on monday .
according to mark sparrow , technical editor for macformat , software will be available for both processors through apple 's xcode development platform that can compile code for both processors .
" install cds will contain something called a unified binary which will install the appropriate version depending on the type of processor in the mac .
" older powerpc software will run on the new machines thanks to a special ultra-light emulator called rosetta , " he said .

the move , officially announced at the apple worldwide developers conference on monday , could mean people hold off buying new apple laptops .
apple said it was making the move to x86 architecture chips because they offer more power and better efficiency .
the first apple computers with intel chips will be on the market next year .
that is likely to be the mac mini , with the entire product line switching by the end of 2007 .
applications will continue to work on both types of chip-sets for some years .
but graham barlow , editor of macformat magazine , said some people may not buy a new apple machine knowing that a new processor was coming out next year .
" that must be the worry for apple retailers .
i think it 's highly likely there will be some price drops to tempt people to buy the final stocks of powerpc equipped macs , " he told the bbc news website .
apple has sent a strong signal that it would be sensible to wait a year if you want to buy a new powerbook gary barnett , ovum one main motivation behind the switch is because ibm has not yet been able to produce versions of the g5 chip , used in apple 's desktop g5 machines , which are suitable for apple laptops without overheating .
intel is the world 's largest semiconductor company .
ibm and motorola -lrb- now freescale semiconductor -rrb- have been providing powerpc chips to apple for more than a decade .
the announcement has come as a bolt out of the blue to many , and experts say it is one of the biggest transitions in the mac market since the move from os 9 to os x operating systems .
hold off ?
some analysts have suggested that the transition could further damage apple 's low 2.3 % worldwide market share , while others say it is a logical decision .
others worry that it is a big gamble for apple because it might create consumer confusion , and could damage support from a loyal cohort of mac users .
gary barnett , research director at technology analysts ovum , said he was puzzled by the move and had been watching the reaction on internet newsgroup discussion forums .
" one poster was debating whether to upgrade his powerbook or to go on holiday - there was no point in him buying a powerbook if it was going to be obsolete in 18 months ' time , " he told the bbc news website .
apple may have lost the war for the office environment to windows , but it wants to win the next war - the battle for control of your digital entertainment graham barlow , macformat " apple has sent a strong signal that it would be sensible to wait a year if you want to buy a new powerbook . "
apple said the change gets around issues it has previously had with chip supplies , as well as the power versus heat problems it has with ibm chips .
but , added mr barnett , the move was confusing because ibm 's powerpc was about to be produced in huge volumes because of its deal to provide the microprocessors for the next-generation of microsoft , nintendo and sony games consoles .
its openpower initiative , aimed at device manufacturers , was gaining headway too .
it is aimed at improving the market presence of the power architecture through open standards development .
mr barnett said he would have been more impressed if apple had decided to switch to amd processors instead .
amd had " out-innovated " intel in terms of its 64 processor technology , he said .
" everything around powerpc seems to interesting and optimistic - amd can be classified as that too .
intel is just the current leader , albeit it by a big margin . "
next war but there was no doubt that the move would have a significant impact on software vendors .
a lot depends on getting the mac developers on side at an early stage .
the company announced on monday the release of the developer transition kit with an intel-based mac development system and preview versions of apple 's software .
it will let developers prepare versions of their applications which will run on both powerpc and intel-based macs .
powerpc will be in all the main next-generations games consoles macformat magazine 's mr barlow said reaction from mac users had been mixed , from " hell has frozen over " to " apple 's transition has come full circle " .
" of course , people 's fears are that their macs will become obsolete when the new range of intel-based macs come out in 2006 , " he said .
" but ultimately it means faster macs and more choice for the consumer , which is a good thing . "
others think the move shows that processor brand is becoming increasingly irrelevant .
mr barlow added that it would open a plethora of opportunities for apple in the computing market .
" apple may have lost the war for the office environment to windows , but it wants to win the next war - the battle for control of your digital entertainment , " he said .
" with the ipod and itunes music store it already owns most of the digital audio market , but it 's going to need new devices and new technology to get control of the emerging downloadable movie market too .
" these are the kind of possibilities that the intel chips provide with their low power consumption and built-in digital rights management . "
it could also pave the way for the quicker adoption of wimax - ultra fast wireless net connectivity which intel is touting and other developments in wireless portable devices .
apple previewed a version of mac os x tiger , running on an intel-based mac , to more than 3,800 developers on monday .
according to mark sparrow , technical editor for macformat , software will be available for both processors through apple 's xcode development platform that can compile code for both processors .
" install cds will contain something called a unified binary which will install the appropriate version depending on the type of processor in the mac .

a lot depends on getting the mac developers on side at an early stage .
the company announced on monday the release of the developer transition kit with an intel-based mac development system and preview versions of apple 's software .
it will let developers prepare versions of their applications which will run on both powerpc and intel-based macs .

" of course , people 's fears are that their macs will become obsolete when the new range of intel-based macs come out in 2006 , " he said .

others think the move shows that processor brand is becoming increasingly irrelevant .
mr barlow added that it would open a plethora of opportunities for apple in the computing market .

apple previewed a version of mac os x tiger , running on an intel-based mac , to more than 3,800 developers on monday .
according to mark sparrow , technical editor for macformat , software will be available for both processors through apple 's xcode development platform that can compile code for both processors .

the move , officially announced at the apple worldwide developers conference on monday , could mean people hold off buying new apple laptops .
apple said it was making the move to x86 architecture chips because they offer more power and better efficiency .
the first apple computers with intel chips will be on the market next year .
that is likely to be the mac mini , with the entire product line switching by the end of 2007 .
applications will continue to work on both types of chip-sets for some years .
but graham barlow , editor of macformat magazine , said some people may not buy a new apple machine knowing that a new processor was coming out next year .
" that must be the worry for apple retailers .
i think it 's highly likely there will be some price drops to tempt people to buy the final stocks of powerpc equipped macs , " he told the bbc news website .
apple has sent a strong signal that it would be sensible to wait a year if you want to buy a new powerbook gary barnett , ovum one main motivation behind the switch is because ibm has not yet been able to produce versions of the g5 chip , used in apple 's desktop g5 machines , which are suitable for apple laptops without overheating .
intel is the world 's largest semiconductor company .
ibm and motorola -lrb- now freescale semiconductor -rrb- have been providing powerpc chips to apple for more than a decade .
the announcement has come as a bolt out of the blue to many , and experts say it is one of the biggest transitions in the mac market since the move from os 9 to os x operating systems .
hold off ?
some analysts have suggested that the transition could further damage apple 's low 2.3 % worldwide market share , while others say it is a logical decision .
others worry that it is a big gamble for apple because it might create consumer confusion , and could damage support from a loyal cohort of mac users .
gary barnett , research director at technology analysts ovum , said he was puzzled by the move and had been watching the reaction on internet newsgroup discussion forums .
" one poster was debating whether to upgrade his powerbook or to go on holiday - there was no point in him buying a powerbook if it was going to be obsolete in 18 months ' time , " he told the bbc news website .

apple said the change gets around issues it has previously had with chip supplies , as well as the power versus heat problems it has with ibm chips .

the claims against president lula 's governing workers ' party were made on monday by the leader of another party .
speaking in brasilia on tuesday night , lula said the votes of lawmakers should never be up for sale .
he said he personally would ensure that investigations reached their logical conclusion .
by coincidence , the president was addressing an international forum to discuss ways of combating corruption .
on paper this was an uncomfortable encounter in which a president facing bribery claims addressed international delegates who have come to brazil to discuss corruption .
no outright denial initially looking nervous and drawn , lula nonetheless offered a spirited performance .
" i swore by the constitution to be the main guardian of brazil 's institutions , " he said , " and the parliament can not ever be for sale . "
the president promised a thorough investigation , adding there would be no cover-up .
" if needs be , we are prepared to cut off our own flesh , " he said - an apparent reference to alleged wrongdoing within his own workers ' party .
tellingly , there was no outright denial of the allegation that the party treasurer made payments to lawmakers from other parties but neither has there yet been any hard evidence to support the claim .
the treasurer , delubio soares , has been kept away from the media since the story broke .
he is expected to give his version of events on wednesday .

the wales tourist board said new figures showed awareness of the event was rising and there had been an increase in people taking golf breaks .
the ryder cup is contested by the best european and us golfers every two years .
it will be held at the celtic manor resort , near newport , in 2010 .
it is hoped wales can take a share of the multimillion pound golf tourism market , which brings in an estimated £ 175m annually to the economy in scotland .
the ryder cup , watched by 435 million people worldwide , has already been heralded as partly responsible for a new link between the celtic manor and the world 's largest golf complex - the mission hills resort in china .
we will not get a better chance to raise our profile in the us rob holt sir terry matthews , chairman of the celtic manor resort , said the partnership will benefit members of each club and unveiling it was " a great privilege " .
claire sanders , from the wales tourist board , said owners of mission hills , which has 10 18-hole courses , knew the joint venture would be advantageous .
" the golf scene in china is such a developing market - i am sure that they are fully aware that , up to and after 2010 , they will benefit from the work being done to promote the celtic manor , " she said .
discussions have also begun about a new tournament - possibly to be called the double dragon - which could alternate between the two resorts .
a spokesman for the celtic manor resort said these talks were at an early stage and , if the world 's top players were to play in the event , discussions would be needed with representatives from the european and asian tours .
the celtic manor resort has linked up with a prestigious chinese hotel back on the fairways , andy calton , editor of today 's golfer magazine , said wales was starting to become a more attractive destination for golfers , partly due to the ryder cup .
" it used to be scotland and ireland where people went on short breaks , but wales is starting to get up there , " he said .
" to be mentioned at that level is a massive achievement . "
earlier this year , three welsh courses were included in the top 100 courses outside the us by american magazine golf digest for the first time .
rob holt , general manager of ryder cup wales 2010 , said the courses had not changed , but the profile of wales as a golfing venue had improved .
bernard langer captained the europeans to ryder cup victory in 2004 " the ryder cup is not just about three days in 2010 - we are using it as a catalyst to promote wales , " he said .
" we will not get a better chance to raise our profile in the us - it is our biggest chance to break the us market . "
and it is not just south wales that is benefiting - david morkill , secretary from the royal st david 's course in harlech said the ryder cup had given a " spin-off effect " across the whole of wales .
" the profile of visitors has also changed - we are getting more visitors from abroad , and they will come regardless of the distance -lsb- from the celtic manor -rsb- . "
he added that the ryder cup had also provided the impetus for seven courses in north west wales to link up to promote themselves .
new links outside golf itself , gerry hallett , deputy chief executive of the wales trade international arm of the welsh assembly , said that business as well as tourism was taking advantage of the ryder cup .
he said the increased awareness about wales was already having " a fairly broad return " and that results would become " more tangible " over time .
he added the relationship between the celtic manor and mission hills was an good example of how new business links could be created .
" we are keen to use it as a backdrop - it is a nice route into china , which is an unfamiliar route for small welsh businesses , " he said .

" we would urge the trust to be as frank and as open with the public as they can because it will not be easy to win an argument that recommends closure . "
the audit report revealed the trust overspent by £ 9m in 2004/5 and that it owes £ 12m .
it is also forecasting a £ 10m deficit in 2005/6 .
district auditor lynne snowball said the trust would have to save £ 66m over the next three years to get back on track .

she said : " we must accept that there will be financial arguments for and against the maternity unit 's closure .

" we would urge the trust to be as frank and as open with the public as they can because it will not be easy to win an argument that recommends closure . "
the audit report revealed the trust overspent by £ 9m in 2004/5 and that it owes £ 12m .
it is also forecasting a £ 10m deficit in 2005/6 .
district auditor lynne snowball said the trust would have to save £ 66m over the next three years to get back on track .

the conservatives urged mrs blair to hand her £ 30,000 fee for the lecture on life inside downing street to charity .
asked about the row , an exasperated mr blair said : " i do n't think there 's ever anything i can say on these things that can make it better . "
he said cherie had also helped back london 's olympics bid while in the us .
' tightrope ' mr blair was in washington for talks with george bush before the g8 summit .
what is wrong to me is the blair family making tens of thousands of pounds out of effectively exploiting mr blair 's job chris grayling , shadow commons leader mrs blair said the fact her speech came at the same time her husband was in the us was a coincidence .
she said she had to " walk a tightrope " with her joint roles as a professional woman and as the uk prime minister 's wife .
she told a us interviewer her engagement had been booked well in advance , adding : " it has crossed my mind that of all the 365 days in the year that tony could have come , this was not my favourite . "
she went on to say " you ca n't please all the people all the time " .
ministerial code mrs blair argued that dennis thatcher had a number of " outside interests " and " no-one found anything wrong with that " .
the row centres on mrs blair 's decision to give a talk on tuesday at washington 's kennedy centre - billed as the inside account of the " first lady of downing street " .
the conservatives say the lecture went against the spirit of the ministerial code which prevents members of the government making money from commercial activities relating to their job .
shadow commons leader chris grayling says the code should cover activities directly linked to the job of the prime minister .
mr grayling said mrs blair should donate any fee to charity arguing the " commercial nature " of her trip was " inappropriate " .
' normal procedure ' he said : " what is wrong to me is the blair family making tens of thousands of pounds out of effectively exploiting mr blair 's job when the ministerial code says they are not allowed to do that . "
and he has written to foreign secretary jack straw saying he is " astonished " britain 's ambassador was involved in mrs blair 's private engagement , after sir david manning introduced mrs blair at the kennedy centre .
" i should be grateful if you could investigate what has happened and in particular why a senior civil servant would agree to participate in a purely commercial event on behalf of mrs blair , " he writes .
but downing street said it was " normal procedure " for sir david to introduce or accompany " any prominent british citizen visiting washington " .
the foreign office said sir david had introduced tv chef nigella lawson and artist andrew goldsworthy when they were in washington .
the spokesman added that on the day of mrs blair 's speech the ambassador also introduced the headteacher of the local british school in washington .
a spokesman for london 2012 said : " cherie blair , as a senior bid ambassador , has undertaken a series of briefings with the international media and we were delighted that she was able to meet and brief senior figures from the american media while in new york . "
