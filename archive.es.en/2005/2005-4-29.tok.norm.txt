" the proposal of the turkish prime minister -lrb- recep tayyip erdogan -rrb- is good and this path should be followed , " schröder said during an interview with turkish television station ntv before his may 3-4 visit to turkey .
however the german chancellor said it was important that a " nation looks at its history with a sense of self-criticism . "
schröder added that this question would " never " be a pre-condition imposed on turkey - which rejects the armenian claim of a genocide - for its entry into the european union .
ankara fears that the genocide allegations could fuel anti-turkish sentiment in international public opinion at a time when it is vying for eu membership .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .
" and the only thing that was piled up there was cheese ... we stuffed ourselves , and i have n't eaten cheese after that for i do n't know how many years .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .

when special " trophy commissions " made up of red army experts - whose official mission was to look for cultural property stolen by the nazis - began removing and transporting art treasures from germany back to the soviet union , these fragments went with them . vocal criticism the prussian cultural heritage foundation in berlin has been vocal in its criticism of the exhibition . but the pushkin museum insists that according to international law on restitution of works of art looted during armed conflicts , the pieces belong to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is n't the first time exhibitions of so-called " trophy art " from germany have taken place in st. petersburg and moscow .
in november 1992 , the hermitage -lrb- photo -rrb- showed drawings from the bremen kunsthalle and most of the objects were exhibited again in moscow in march 1993 . the perceived recalcitrance of russia 's museums was underscored by the fact that on tuesday , the same day the latest exhibition opened , the foundation symbolically returned a work of 17th century art to russia as a gesture of reconciliation . " russia 's behavior is seriously straining our relationship and is highly detrimental to the position of germany 's museum directors , " said christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture . secret spoils the german government has been trying to reclaim its cultural property from russia for some 15 years , including the restitution of almost 200,000 works of art , two million books and about three kilometers of files . for years , russian authorities denied it was keeping secret spoils in special depots , while simultaneously maintaining that its german cultural property was legitimately owned as reparations . then , in 1992 , the promising german-russian treaty of cultural cooperation was expected to usher in a new era of amicability , but by the mid-1990s the restitution negotiations had caved in to opposition from influential russian political sectors rejecting the restitution claims , as well as pressure from nationalistic groups championing the right of the russian people to german cultural property as indemnity for its 30 million dead and the suffering and atrocities russia had to endure through nazi aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as günter nooke from the christian democrats pointed out in an interview with the berliner zeitung , the issue provides a stark contrast to the upbeat state of german-russian relations touted by chancellor schröder and president putin .

when special " trophy commissions " made up of red army experts - whose official mission was to look for cultural property stolen by the nazis - began removing and transporting art treasures from germany back to the soviet union , these fragments went with them . vocal criticism the prussian cultural heritage foundation in berlin has been vocal in its criticism of the exhibition . but the pushkin museum insists that according to international law on restitution of works of art looted during armed conflicts , the pieces belong to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is n't the first time exhibitions of so-called " trophy art " from germany have taken place in st. petersburg and moscow .
in november 1992 , the hermitage -lrb- photo -rrb- showed drawings from the bremen kunsthalle and most of the objects were exhibited again in moscow in march 1993 . the perceived recalcitrance of russia 's museums was underscored by the fact that on tuesday , the same day the latest exhibition opened , the foundation symbolically returned a work of 17th century art to russia as a gesture of reconciliation . " russia 's behavior is seriously straining our relationship and is highly detrimental to the position of germany 's museum directors , " said christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture . secret spoils the german government has been trying to reclaim its cultural property from russia for some 15 years , including the restitution of almost 200,000 works of art , two million books and about three kilometers of files . for years , russian authorities denied it was keeping secret spoils in special depots , while simultaneously maintaining that its german cultural property was legitimately owned as reparations . then , in 1992 , the promising german-russian treaty of cultural cooperation was expected to usher in a new era of amicability , but by the mid-1990s the restitution negotiations had caved in to opposition from influential russian political sectors rejecting the restitution claims , as well as pressure from nationalistic groups championing the right of the russian people to german cultural property as indemnity for its 30 million dead and the suffering and atrocities russia had to endure through nazi aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as günter nooke from the christian democrats pointed out in an interview with the berliner zeitung , the issue provides a stark contrast to the upbeat state of german-russian relations touted by chancellor schröder and president putin . " this is a political standstill , " he said .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .
" and the only thing that was piled up there was cheese ... we stuffed ourselves , and i have n't eaten cheese after that for i do n't know how many years .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .
" and the only thing that was piled up there was cheese ... we stuffed ourselves , and i have n't eaten cheese after that for i do n't know how many years .

" the proposal of the turkish prime minister -lrb- recep tayyip erdogan -rrb- is good and this path should be followed , " schröder said during an interview with turkish television station ntv before his may 3-4 visit to turkey .
however the german chancellor said it was important that a " nation looks at its history with a sense of self-criticism . "
schröder added that this question would " never " be a pre-condition imposed on turkey - which rejects the armenian claim of a genocide - for its entry into the european union .
ankara fears that the genocide allegations could fuel anti-turkish sentiment in international public opinion at a time when it is vying for eu membership .
erdogan said friday turkey could normalize relations with armenia at the same time as undertaking the study of the armenian massacres .
turkey had previously demanded that armenia first abandon its campaign for the recognition of the world war i massacres as genocide . dw-world.de armenian massacre clouds turkey 's eu bid tens of thousands of armenians including the president and top officials filed through the towering genocide memorial in yerevan on sunday to commemorate the 90th anniversary of mass killings by ottoman turks .

when special " trophy commissions " made up of red army experts - whose official mission was to look for cultural property stolen by the nazis - began removing and transporting art treasures from germany back to the soviet union , these fragments went with them . vocal criticism the prussian cultural heritage foundation in berlin has been vocal in its criticism of the exhibition . but the pushkin museum insists that according to international law on restitution of works of art looted during armed conflicts , the pieces belong to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is n't the first time exhibitions of so-called " trophy art " from germany have taken place in st. petersburg and moscow .
in november 1992 , the hermitage -lrb- photo -rrb- showed drawings from the bremen kunsthalle and most of the objects were exhibited again in moscow in march 1993 . the perceived recalcitrance of russia 's museums was underscored by the fact that on tuesday , the same day the latest exhibition opened , the foundation symbolically returned a work of 17th century art to russia as a gesture of reconciliation . " russia 's behavior is seriously straining our relationship and is highly detrimental to the position of germany 's museum directors , " said christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture . secret spoils the german government has been trying to reclaim its cultural property from russia for some 15 years , including the restitution of almost 200,000 works of art , two million books and about three kilometers of files . for years , russian authorities denied it was keeping secret spoils in special depots , while simultaneously maintaining that its german cultural property was legitimately owned as reparations . then , in 1992 , the promising german-russian treaty of cultural cooperation was expected to usher in a new era of amicability , but by the mid-1990s the restitution negotiations had caved in to opposition from influential russian political sectors rejecting the restitution claims , as well as pressure from nationalistic groups championing the right of the russian people to german cultural property as indemnity for its 30 million dead and the suffering and atrocities russia had to endure through nazi aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as günter nooke from the christian democrats pointed out in an interview with the berliner zeitung , the issue provides a stark contrast to the upbeat state of german-russian relations touted by chancellor schröder and president putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.04.2005 euro gains popularity in central europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is supplanting the koruna , forint and zloty it may be up to five years until they plan to formally adopt the euro , but many central european countries are already using the currency for an increasing number of transactions . at cashiers in many large stores there are signs that euros are accepted and stating the daily exchange rate - while business transactions are increasingly being done in euros .
on january 1 last year , slovakia introduced a new law allowing shops and restaurants to freely accept euros , four months before the country joined the european union . " until then establishments had to have special permission but more and more wanted to be able to accept payments in euros , " slovak central bank spokesman igor barat told the afp news agency . tourists make up the bulk of the euro payments , but numerous slovaks returning from holidays in the euro zone use up their money this way . " last year we saw an increase of several percent in the number of payments made in euros which is down to the increase in tourists , " petr vyhnalek , a director of retail chain globus in the czech republic , said .
" we have seen a significant number of payments in euros in prague by tourists and also in border regions by poles and germans , " vyhnalek added . countdown to the euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovenia , as the countdown begins to the euro 's expected adoption in 2007 , the government plans to introduce dual-pricing in all stores later this year .
prices are already increasingly being advertised both in slovenian tolars and euros , particularly for real estate and cars . the euro has become popular in poland 's border regions , particularly along the frontier with germany but also with ukraine and lithuania . " the euro has superseded the traditional dollar there , " stanislaw kluza , an economist with bgz bank , said . around 30 percent of domestic and export business transactions by larger czech companies are now carried out in euros , says czech economic chamber president jaromir drabek . " czech companies are increasingly using euros because of the currency 's stability compared to the fluctuating koruna exchange rate , and that proportion is set to grow , " drabek told afp . the trend is particularly strong in the automotive and chemical industries .
the czechs plan to adopt the euro in 2010 .
some slovak banks already state the euro 's rate equivalent on their clients ' koruna account statements . " this is getting slovaks used to the euro ahead of its adoption in 2009 , " said barat . euro loans on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outside view of the hungarian parliament building in budapest .
many companies in the region have taken out loans in euros due to better interest rates .
in hungary euro-denominated retail and household loans are dramatically on the rise .
seventy percent of new corporate loans last year were in a foreign currency , predominantly euros , according to the hungarian financial supervisory authority . " the most important reasons ... are companies ' confidence in the stability of the forint exchange rate and the difference between the relatively high interest rate on forint loans and the relatively low interest rate on foreign currency denominated loans , " it said in a recent report . in 2004 , 44.5 percent of all corporate loans were foreign currency denominated -lrb- mostly euros -rrb- , up from 35 percent in 2002 , while 14.5 percent of household loans were foreign currency denominated , up from 2.9 percent in 2002 , the authority said . in slovakia train and plane tickets abroad , taxi fares and restaurant and hotel bills can all be paid in euros .
a slovenian public opinion poll rated the euro the most trusted " institution " . tourist-orientated companies in slovenia can legally accept euros .
shops near the italian or austrian border and petrol stations and motorway toll stations countrywide also accept euros . in lithuania the law already allows payments in euros and some retailers post prices in euros .
in estonia , even though accepting euros is illegal , shops display prices both in kroons and euros , to ensure a smooth transition to the euro , which estonia plans to adopt in 2007 , and customers get receipts in both currencies . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair shelves plans for quick euro entry a week ahead of the british general election on may 5 , polls suggest prime minister tony blair is all set to win a third term in power .

" we have two expectations from the talks , " schröder said in a press conference with visiting new zealand prime minister helen clark . " the first is that we reinforce the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as it is now and we need to put all our efforts into that , " he said .

" the proposal of the turkish prime minister -lrb- recep tayyip erdogan -rrb- is good and this path should be followed , " schröder said during an interview with turkish television station ntv before his may 3-4 visit to turkey .
however the german chancellor said it was important that a " nation looks at its history with a sense of self-criticism . "
schröder added that this question would " never " be a pre-condition imposed on turkey - which rejects the armenian claim of a genocide - for its entry into the european union .
ankara fears that the genocide allegations could fuel anti-turkish sentiment in international public opinion at a time when it is vying for eu membership .
erdogan said friday turkey could normalize relations with armenia at the same time as undertaking the study of the armenian massacres .
turkey had previously demanded that armenia first abandon its campaign for the recognition of the world war i massacres as genocide . dw-world.de armenian massacre clouds turkey 's eu bid tens of thousands of armenians including the president and top officials filed through the towering genocide memorial in yerevan on sunday to commemorate the 90th anniversary of mass killings by ottoman turks .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 29.04.2005 impressive iran 's bundesliga connection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's mahdavikia -lrb- right -rrb- is one the bundesliga 's iranian contingent if its current impressive form continues , iran 's national soccer team should feature at the 2006 world cup in germany .
for a number of the players it will be like playing at home after another season in the bundesliga . a strong campaign in asian qualifying zone has so far seen iran installed as favorites to make it to the world cup in germany in 2006 at the expense of experienced teams such as south korea and japan . for some players within the unbeaten iranian squad , the journey to the world cup will not require much international travel .
the current success of iran can be traced to a number of players performing in the bundesliga . german influence in iran is stronger than in any other asian nation with striker vahid hashemian turning out for champions-elect bayern munich , bochum 's moharram navidkia , playmaker fereydoon zandi at kaiserslautern and hamburg sv 's mehdi mahdavikia are all playing a part in the campaign to bring their country to their adopted land to battle for the ultimate soccer prize next year . iran coach branko ivankovic has praised the bundesliga quartet and considers their contribution to be an integral part of the team 's success at the midway point of the asian zone 's third and final qualifying round .
" i am quite pleased with the german-based players who have adapted very well to the team so far .
the experience they have gained in bundesliga is important in helping the team to win matches , " the 51-year-old croatian told fifaworldcup.com. benched hashemian lethal for iran vahid ' the helicopter ' hashemian , named as such due to his presence in aerial duels , is arguably one of the most successful asian players in german soccer .
the 28-year-old forward scored 16 goals last season at his former club bochum as they recorded an impressive fifth-placed finish in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a two million euro transfer to bavarian giants bayern , however , hashemian has been restricted to substitute performances due to the impressive line-up of marksmen in the squad which includes roy makaay , claudio pizarro , josé paolo guerrero and roque santa cruz . even so , the lack of first team action has done nothing to dent his resolve or blunt his sharpness in front of goal when given the chance .
hashemian has scored four goals in the past six world cup qualifiers , including a brace that handed iran three precious points in the crucial 2-1 victory over group a favorites japan in march . " hashemian has developed into a great player after his spells with three german bundesliga clubs .
i am happy to see how quickly he fitted back into the team after his return , " ivankovic said , referring to the striker 's three-year self-imposed exile from the national team . kaiserslautern 's zandi runs midfield show fereydoon zandi is a welcome addition to the iran team .
the german-born midfielder , recently made a nationalized iranian , has given his coach a pivotal center to a powerful midfield trio , with hamburg 's mahdavikia and javad nekounam the other constituent parts . " he has done a brilliant job with the team in the past three qualifiers to date , " said ivankovic .
" what i would say is that he has a lot of potential to develop as you see he has been getting better and better game after game . "
zandi 's german style of play has added a combative edge to the team and his distribution and vision has helped iran overcome some quality opposition with commanding performances from his central role . mahdavikia an icon-in-progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdi mahdavikia despite the playmaker mantle sitting comfortably on the shoulders of the kaiserslautern man , the player that is becoming the most iconic and valuable is the emerging mehdi mahdavikia . the 26-year-old hamburg player was named asian player of the year in 2003 and has gone from strength to strength in the national team , providing the attackers with the lifeblood of their game : the incisive ball and pinpoint crosses . young star navidkia ready to break through bochum 's moharram navidkia is also a player to watch .
the former olympic team captain and 2003 footballer of the year in iran is still only 22 and has made some crucial appearances as a substitute in the national team 's world cup campaign to date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moharram navidkia with a solid front partnership of hashemian and veteran ali daei , the leading scorer in the asian qualifying tournament , navidkia is struggling to break into the team on a regular basis but ivankovic has high hopes for him and the rest of the youngsters pushing for inclusion . " i am hoping that i can pass on to the next iran coach a team based around this young generation and with five players under 23 in the current team , i believe we are heading in the right direction , " ivankovic concluded .
if things continue as they are , that direction will be towards germany and the 2006 world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rankings " a joke " as germany slip to 20th jürgen klinsmann has branded the fifa world ranking system " a bad joke " after germany slipped to 20th place .

for a number of the players it will be like playing at home after another season in the bundesliga . a strong campaign in asian qualifying zone has so far seen iran installed as favorites to make it to the world cup in germany in 2006 at the expense of experienced teams such as south korea and japan . for some players within the unbeaten iranian squad , the journey to the world cup will not require much international travel .
the current success of iran can be traced to a number of players performing in the bundesliga . german influence in iran is stronger than in any other asian nation with striker vahid hashemian turning out for champions-elect bayern munich , bochum 's moharram navidkia , playmaker fereydoon zandi at kaiserslautern and hamburg sv 's mehdi mahdavikia are all playing a part in the campaign to bring their country to their adopted land to battle for the ultimate soccer prize next year . iran coach branko ivankovic has praised the bundesliga quartet and considers their contribution to be an integral part of the team 's success at the midway point of the asian zone 's third and final qualifying round .
" i am quite pleased with the german-based players who have adapted very well to the team so far .
the experience they have gained in bundesliga is important in helping the team to win matches , " the 51-year-old croatian told fifaworldcup.com. benched hashemian lethal for iran vahid ' the helicopter ' hashemian , named as such due to his presence in aerial duels , is arguably one of the most successful asian players in german soccer .
the 28-year-old forward scored 16 goals last season at his former club bochum as they recorded an impressive fifth-placed finish in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a two million euro transfer to bavarian giants bayern , however , hashemian has been restricted to substitute performances due to the impressive line-up of marksmen in the squad which includes roy makaay , claudio pizarro , josé paolo guerrero and roque santa cruz . even so , the lack of first team action has done nothing to dent his resolve or blunt his sharpness in front of goal when given the chance .
hashemian has scored four goals in the past six world cup qualifiers , including a brace that handed iran three precious points in the crucial 2-1 victory over group a favorites japan in march . " hashemian has developed into a great player after his spells with three german bundesliga clubs .
i am happy to see how quickly he fitted back into the team after his return , " ivankovic said , referring to the striker 's three-year self-imposed exile from the national team . kaiserslautern 's zandi runs midfield show fereydoon zandi is a welcome addition to the iran team .
the german-born midfielder , recently made a nationalized iranian , has given his coach a pivotal center to a powerful midfield trio , with hamburg 's mahdavikia and javad nekounam the other constituent parts . " he has done a brilliant job with the team in the past three qualifiers to date , " said ivankovic .
" what i would say is that he has a lot of potential to develop as you see he has been getting better and better game after game . "
zandi 's german style of play has added a combative edge to the team and his distribution and vision has helped iran overcome some quality opposition with commanding performances from his central role . mahdavikia an icon-in-progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdi mahdavikia despite the playmaker mantle sitting comfortably on the shoulders of the kaiserslautern man , the player that is becoming the most iconic and valuable is the emerging mehdi mahdavikia . the 26-year-old hamburg player was named asian player of the year in 2003 and has gone from strength to strength in the national team , providing the attackers with the lifeblood of their game : the incisive ball and pinpoint crosses . young star navidkia ready to break through bochum 's moharram navidkia is also a player to watch .
the former olympic team captain and 2003 footballer of the year in iran is still only 22 and has made some crucial appearances as a substitute in the national team 's world cup campaign to date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moharram navidkia with a solid front partnership of hashemian and veteran ali daei , the leading scorer in the asian qualifying tournament , navidkia is struggling to break into the team on a regular basis but ivankovic has high hopes for him and the rest of the youngsters pushing for inclusion . " i am hoping that i can pass on to the next iran coach a team based around this young generation and with five players under 23 in the current team , i believe we are heading in the right direction , " ivankovic concluded .
if things continue as they are , that direction will be towards germany and the 2006 world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rankings " a joke " as germany slip to 20th jürgen klinsmann has branded the fifa world ranking system " a bad joke " after germany slipped to 20th place .

for a number of the players it will be like playing at home after another season in the bundesliga . a strong campaign in asian qualifying zone has so far seen iran installed as favorites to make it to the world cup in germany in 2006 at the expense of experienced teams such as south korea and japan . for some players within the unbeaten iranian squad , the journey to the world cup will not require much international travel .
the current success of iran can be traced to a number of players performing in the bundesliga . german influence in iran is stronger than in any other asian nation with striker vahid hashemian turning out for champions-elect bayern munich , bochum 's moharram navidkia , playmaker fereydoon zandi at kaiserslautern and hamburg sv 's mehdi mahdavikia are all playing a part in the campaign to bring their country to their adopted land to battle for the ultimate soccer prize next year . iran coach branko ivankovic has praised the bundesliga quartet and considers their contribution to be an integral part of the team 's success at the midway point of the asian zone 's third and final qualifying round .
" i am quite pleased with the german-based players who have adapted very well to the team so far .
the experience they have gained in bundesliga is important in helping the team to win matches , " the 51-year-old croatian told fifaworldcup.com. benched hashemian lethal for iran vahid ' the helicopter ' hashemian , named as such due to his presence in aerial duels , is arguably one of the most successful asian players in german soccer .
the 28-year-old forward scored 16 goals last season at his former club bochum as they recorded an impressive fifth-placed finish in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a two million euro transfer to bavarian giants bayern , however , hashemian has been restricted to substitute performances due to the impressive line-up of marksmen in the squad which includes roy makaay , claudio pizarro , josé paolo guerrero and roque santa cruz . even so , the lack of first team action has done nothing to dent his resolve or blunt his sharpness in front of goal when given the chance .
hashemian has scored four goals in the past six world cup qualifiers , including a brace that handed iran three precious points in the crucial 2-1 victory over group a favorites japan in march . " hashemian has developed into a great player after his spells with three german bundesliga clubs .
i am happy to see how quickly he fitted back into the team after his return , " ivankovic said , referring to the striker 's three-year self-imposed exile from the national team . kaiserslautern 's zandi runs midfield show fereydoon zandi is a welcome addition to the iran team .
the german-born midfielder , recently made a nationalized iranian , has given his coach a pivotal center to a powerful midfield trio , with hamburg 's mahdavikia and javad nekounam the other constituent parts . " he has done a brilliant job with the team in the past three qualifiers to date , " said ivankovic .
" what i would say is that he has a lot of potential to develop as you see he has been getting better and better game after game . "
zandi 's german style of play has added a combative edge to the team and his distribution and vision has helped iran overcome some quality opposition with commanding performances from his central role . mahdavikia an icon-in-progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdi mahdavikia despite the playmaker mantle sitting comfortably on the shoulders of the kaiserslautern man , the player that is becoming the most iconic and valuable is the emerging mehdi mahdavikia . the 26-year-old hamburg player was named asian player of the year in 2003 and has gone from strength to strength in the national team , providing the attackers with the lifeblood of their game : the incisive ball and pinpoint crosses . young star navidkia ready to break through bochum 's moharram navidkia is also a player to watch .
the former olympic team captain and 2003 footballer of the year in iran is still only 22 and has made some crucial appearances as a substitute in the national team 's world cup campaign to date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moharram navidkia with a solid front partnership of hashemian and veteran ali daei , the leading scorer in the asian qualifying tournament , navidkia is struggling to break into the team on a regular basis but ivankovic has high hopes for him and the rest of the youngsters pushing for inclusion . " i am hoping that i can pass on to the next iran coach a team based around this young generation and with five players under 23 in the current team , i believe we are heading in the right direction , " ivankovic concluded .

on january 1 last year , slovakia introduced a new law allowing shops and restaurants to freely accept euros , four months before the country joined the european union . " until then establishments had to have special permission but more and more wanted to be able to accept payments in euros , " slovak central bank spokesman igor barat told the afp news agency . tourists make up the bulk of the euro payments , but numerous slovaks returning from holidays in the euro zone use up their money this way . " last year we saw an increase of several percent in the number of payments made in euros which is down to the increase in tourists , " petr vyhnalek , a director of retail chain globus in the czech republic , said .
" we have seen a significant number of payments in euros in prague by tourists and also in border regions by poles and germans , " vyhnalek added . countdown to the euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovenia , as the countdown begins to the euro 's expected adoption in 2007 , the government plans to introduce dual-pricing in all stores later this year .
prices are already increasingly being advertised both in slovenian tolars and euros , particularly for real estate and cars . the euro has become popular in poland 's border regions , particularly along the frontier with germany but also with ukraine and lithuania . " the euro has superseded the traditional dollar there , " stanislaw kluza , an economist with bgz bank , said . around 30 percent of domestic and export business transactions by larger czech companies are now carried out in euros , says czech economic chamber president jaromir drabek . " czech companies are increasingly using euros because of the currency 's stability compared to the fluctuating koruna exchange rate , and that proportion is set to grow , " drabek told afp . the trend is particularly strong in the automotive and chemical industries .
the czechs plan to adopt the euro in 2010 .
some slovak banks already state the euro 's rate equivalent on their clients ' koruna account statements . " this is getting slovaks used to the euro ahead of its adoption in 2009 , " said barat . euro loans on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outside view of the hungarian parliament building in budapest .
many companies in the region have taken out loans in euros due to better interest rates .
in hungary euro-denominated retail and household loans are dramatically on the rise .
seventy percent of new corporate loans last year were in a foreign currency , predominantly euros , according to the hungarian financial supervisory authority . " the most important reasons ... are companies ' confidence in the stability of the forint exchange rate and the difference between the relatively high interest rate on forint loans and the relatively low interest rate on foreign currency denominated loans , " it said in a recent report . in 2004 , 44.5 percent of all corporate loans were foreign currency denominated -lrb- mostly euros -rrb- , up from 35 percent in 2002 , while 14.5 percent of household loans were foreign currency denominated , up from 2.9 percent in 2002 , the authority said . in slovakia train and plane tickets abroad , taxi fares and restaurant and hotel bills can all be paid in euros .
a slovenian public opinion poll rated the euro the most trusted " institution " . tourist-orientated companies in slovenia can legally accept euros .
shops near the italian or austrian border and petrol stations and motorway toll stations countrywide also accept euros . in lithuania the law already allows payments in euros and some retailers post prices in euros .
in estonia , even though accepting euros is illegal , shops display prices both in kroons and euros , to ensure a smooth transition to the euro , which estonia plans to adopt in 2007 , and customers get receipts in both currencies . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair shelves plans for quick euro entry a week ahead of the british general election on may 5 , polls suggest prime minister tony blair is all set to win a third term in power .

" we have two expectations from the talks , " schröder said in a press conference with visiting new zealand prime minister helen clark . " the first is that we reinforce the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as it is now and we need to put all our efforts into that , " he said .
" the second is that there is a credible disarmament mechanism and we hope we will see movement from countries on this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clark -lrb- photo , with joschka fischer -rrb- said she hoped the meeting would focus on " striking a balance and ensuring that a country 's right to produce nuclear energy does not provide cover for developing nuclear weapons . "
she pointed out that germany , britain and france should be congratulated for their efforts on attempting to obtain guarantees from iran that it will not use its nuclear program to build weapons . focus on north korea foreign minister joschka fischer will lead the german delegation at the conference in new york which begins monday and lasts until may 27 . attended by diplomats from some 190 countries , it will re-examine the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which was first introduced in 1970 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is expected to push for discussions on tightening npt rules that have been either bent or broken by , for example , iran and north korea . north korea is set to be a major talking point at the conference .
the communist state said this month it had shut down a nuclear power plant and was preparing to re-process the plant 's spent fuel , a move that could result in the production of enough plutonium to build up to six more nuclear bombs . us in the hotseat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the us may well come in for some criticism itself .
president george bush 's track record of tinkering with international anti-nuclear rules has prompted critics to say washington is top among those undermining the authority of the npt .
bush has refused to support a test-ban treaty , threw out the anti-ballistic missile treaty with russia , and is still dragging his feet on negotiating a global treaty to end the production of fissile material for bombs . to many , washington 's perceived double standards set a bad example when it comes to negotiations with countries such as north korea and iran . the us energy department , meanwhile , is keen to promote plans to make stockpiled warheads less sensitive to ageing , thereby saving on weapons maintenance and cutting back its stores . fdp gets tough on nuclear weapons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a matter with particular relevance in germany , where the nuclear question unexpectedly reared its head again this week . in the bundestag , the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with backing from the green party , called for an immediate withdrawal of some 150 land-based us nuclear weapons still housed on german soil - a surprise move from a party generally known for its staunchly pro-american stance . but party leader guido westerwelle described the weapons as a relic of the cold war , and pointed out that the credibility of the npt depended on states coming through on their pledge to disarm . according to article ii of the npt , ratified by the us in 1970 and germany in 1975 , " each non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly , or indirectly . " " it 's time to reconsider whether their presence still serves a relevant purpose , " liberal democrat mp werner hoyer told german weekly der spiegel .
harking back to the days of the iron curtain , most of the 480 us nuclear weapons stored in europe are located in germany , strategically closest to eastern europe . the german delegation in new york , however , is not expected to raise the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 29.04.2005 impressive iran 's bundesliga connection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's mahdavikia -lrb- right -rrb- is one the bundesliga 's iranian contingent if its current impressive form continues , iran 's national soccer team should feature at the 2006 world cup in germany .
for a number of the players it will be like playing at home after another season in the bundesliga . a strong campaign in asian qualifying zone has so far seen iran installed as favorites to make it to the world cup in germany in 2006 at the expense of experienced teams such as south korea and japan . for some players within the unbeaten iranian squad , the journey to the world cup will not require much international travel .
the current success of iran can be traced to a number of players performing in the bundesliga . german influence in iran is stronger than in any other asian nation with striker vahid hashemian turning out for champions-elect bayern munich , bochum 's moharram navidkia , playmaker fereydoon zandi at kaiserslautern and hamburg sv 's mehdi mahdavikia are all playing a part in the campaign to bring their country to their adopted land to battle for the ultimate soccer prize next year . iran coach branko ivankovic has praised the bundesliga quartet and considers their contribution to be an integral part of the team 's success at the midway point of the asian zone 's third and final qualifying round .
" i am quite pleased with the german-based players who have adapted very well to the team so far .
the experience they have gained in bundesliga is important in helping the team to win matches , " the 51-year-old croatian told fifaworldcup.com. benched hashemian lethal for iran vahid ' the helicopter ' hashemian , named as such due to his presence in aerial duels , is arguably one of the most successful asian players in german soccer .
the 28-year-old forward scored 16 goals last season at his former club bochum as they recorded an impressive fifth-placed finish in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a two million euro transfer to bavarian giants bayern , however , hashemian has been restricted to substitute performances due to the impressive line-up of marksmen in the squad which includes roy makaay , claudio pizarro , josé paolo guerrero and roque santa cruz . even so , the lack of first team action has done nothing to dent his resolve or blunt his sharpness in front of goal when given the chance .
hashemian has scored four goals in the past six world cup qualifiers , including a brace that handed iran three precious points in the crucial 2-1 victory over group a favorites japan in march . " hashemian has developed into a great player after his spells with three german bundesliga clubs .
i am happy to see how quickly he fitted back into the team after his return , " ivankovic said , referring to the striker 's three-year self-imposed exile from the national team . kaiserslautern 's zandi runs midfield show fereydoon zandi is a welcome addition to the iran team .
the german-born midfielder , recently made a nationalized iranian , has given his coach a pivotal center to a powerful midfield trio , with hamburg 's mahdavikia and javad nekounam the other constituent parts . " he has done a brilliant job with the team in the past three qualifiers to date , " said ivankovic .
" what i would say is that he has a lot of potential to develop as you see he has been getting better and better game after game . "
zandi 's german style of play has added a combative edge to the team and his distribution and vision has helped iran overcome some quality opposition with commanding performances from his central role . mahdavikia an icon-in-progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdi mahdavikia despite the playmaker mantle sitting comfortably on the shoulders of the kaiserslautern man , the player that is becoming the most iconic and valuable is the emerging mehdi mahdavikia . the 26-year-old hamburg player was named asian player of the year in 2003 and has gone from strength to strength in the national team , providing the attackers with the lifeblood of their game : the incisive ball and pinpoint crosses . young star navidkia ready to break through bochum 's moharram navidkia is also a player to watch .
the former olympic team captain and 2003 footballer of the year in iran is still only 22 and has made some crucial appearances as a substitute in the national team 's world cup campaign to date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moharram navidkia with a solid front partnership of hashemian and veteran ali daei , the leading scorer in the asian qualifying tournament , navidkia is struggling to break into the team on a regular basis but ivankovic has high hopes for him and the rest of the youngsters pushing for inclusion . " i am hoping that i can pass on to the next iran coach a team based around this young generation and with five players under 23 in the current team , i believe we are heading in the right direction , " ivankovic concluded .

these days , about 10 percent of german children are classified as clinically obese and those numbers are rising . " children are eating too much and too many sweet and fatty foods , " said german minister of food and agriculture renate künast , who added that she wants to do something about it by making sure children know all about healthy eating right from kindergarten . meeting recently with us secretary of state for agriculture , eric bost , the two ministers unveiled plans to try to combat the epidemic .
in the us , roughly 17 percent of all primary school children are classified as obese , something which many attribute to the popularity of fast food and a lack of exercise . " -lrb- germans -rrb- are quickly catching up with us , ” said bost . a number one killer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bad dietary habits - an international problem disease caused by the wrong diet accounts for about one-third of all costs to germany 's health care system .
in the us , obesity and lack of exercise are about to overtake smoking as the number one killer . one joint solution is the “ nutritional pyramid , ” officials said .
it is envisioned as an easy to understand guide to a healthy diet .
they believe it is better to prevent obesity than try to cure it and the first step is to improve dietary education . the american version of the nutritional pyramid for children is already on the internet .
visitors to the site can compile their ideal diet .
bost said he takes great pride in the initial response . “ during a 24-hour period , we had over 62 million hits to the internet site , ” he said . many measures needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setting a bad example künast hopes for a similar outcome .
she has just written a book called the “ fat maker ” and feels there is still a lot to do . “ we need to introduce a whole host of measures , in all areas of life , from kindergarten to primary school through to secondary school , and from urban development to the development of new foods , ” she said . schools are the main focus of the campaign .
künast wants children to learn how to prepare healthy meals .
but the food industry is by no means absolved of blame or responsibility .
the minister wants it to cooperate by thinking carefully about their products and making sure their advertisements are completely honest about ingredients and their fat content . rob turner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mcdonald 's goes slim-line for europe responding to growing concern about obesity in europe , the u.s. fast food chain mcdonald 's prepares to launch a new , healthier menu in 16 european countries , offering customers fewer burgers , and more salads .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.04.2005 remembering dachau großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liberators came on april 29 one of the first concentration camps to be liberated by the allies 60 years ago friday , dachau concentration camp was also among the first places in which the west was exposed to the extent of nazi brutality . with allied troops advancing across germany in the final days of world war ii , the ss began evacuating more and more nazi concentration camps .
by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states .

many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .
" and the only thing that was piled up there was cheese ... we stuffed ourselves , and i have n't eaten cheese after that for i do n't know how many years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 29.04.2005 impressive iran 's bundesliga connection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's mahdavikia -lrb- right -rrb- is one the bundesliga 's iranian contingent if its current impressive form continues , iran 's national soccer team should feature at the 2006 world cup in germany .
for a number of the players it will be like playing at home after another season in the bundesliga . a strong campaign in asian qualifying zone has so far seen iran installed as favorites to make it to the world cup in germany in 2006 at the expense of experienced teams such as south korea and japan . for some players within the unbeaten iranian squad , the journey to the world cup will not require much international travel .
the current success of iran can be traced to a number of players performing in the bundesliga . german influence in iran is stronger than in any other asian nation with striker vahid hashemian turning out for champions-elect bayern munich , bochum 's moharram navidkia , playmaker fereydoon zandi at kaiserslautern and hamburg sv 's mehdi mahdavikia are all playing a part in the campaign to bring their country to their adopted land to battle for the ultimate soccer prize next year . iran coach branko ivankovic has praised the bundesliga quartet and considers their contribution to be an integral part of the team 's success at the midway point of the asian zone 's third and final qualifying round .
" i am quite pleased with the german-based players who have adapted very well to the team so far .
the experience they have gained in bundesliga is important in helping the team to win matches , " the 51-year-old croatian told fifaworldcup.com. benched hashemian lethal for iran vahid ' the helicopter ' hashemian , named as such due to his presence in aerial duels , is arguably one of the most successful asian players in german soccer .
the 28-year-old forward scored 16 goals last season at his former club bochum as they recorded an impressive fifth-placed finish in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a two million euro transfer to bavarian giants bayern , however , hashemian has been restricted to substitute performances due to the impressive line-up of marksmen in the squad which includes roy makaay , claudio pizarro , josé paolo guerrero and roque santa cruz . even so , the lack of first team action has done nothing to dent his resolve or blunt his sharpness in front of goal when given the chance .
hashemian has scored four goals in the past six world cup qualifiers , including a brace that handed iran three precious points in the crucial 2-1 victory over group a favorites japan in march . " hashemian has developed into a great player after his spells with three german bundesliga clubs .
i am happy to see how quickly he fitted back into the team after his return , " ivankovic said , referring to the striker 's three-year self-imposed exile from the national team . kaiserslautern 's zandi runs midfield show fereydoon zandi is a welcome addition to the iran team .
the german-born midfielder , recently made a nationalized iranian , has given his coach a pivotal center to a powerful midfield trio , with hamburg 's mahdavikia and javad nekounam the other constituent parts . " he has done a brilliant job with the team in the past three qualifiers to date , " said ivankovic .
" what i would say is that he has a lot of potential to develop as you see he has been getting better and better game after game . "
zandi 's german style of play has added a combative edge to the team and his distribution and vision has helped iran overcome some quality opposition with commanding performances from his central role . mahdavikia an icon-in-progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdi mahdavikia despite the playmaker mantle sitting comfortably on the shoulders of the kaiserslautern man , the player that is becoming the most iconic and valuable is the emerging mehdi mahdavikia . the 26-year-old hamburg player was named asian player of the year in 2003 and has gone from strength to strength in the national team , providing the attackers with the lifeblood of their game : the incisive ball and pinpoint crosses . young star navidkia ready to break through bochum 's moharram navidkia is also a player to watch .
the former olympic team captain and 2003 footballer of the year in iran is still only 22 and has made some crucial appearances as a substitute in the national team 's world cup campaign to date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moharram navidkia with a solid front partnership of hashemian and veteran ali daei , the leading scorer in the asian qualifying tournament , navidkia is struggling to break into the team on a regular basis but ivankovic has high hopes for him and the rest of the youngsters pushing for inclusion . " i am hoping that i can pass on to the next iran coach a team based around this young generation and with five players under 23 in the current team , i believe we are heading in the right direction , " ivankovic concluded .
if things continue as they are , that direction will be towards germany and the 2006 world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rankings " a joke " as germany slip to 20th jürgen klinsmann has branded the fifa world ranking system " a bad joke " after germany slipped to 20th place .

" the proposal of the turkish prime minister -lrb- recep tayyip erdogan -rrb- is good and this path should be followed , " schröder said during an interview with turkish television station ntv before his may 3-4 visit to turkey .
however the german chancellor said it was important that a " nation looks at its history with a sense of self-criticism . "
schröder added that this question would " never " be a pre-condition imposed on turkey - which rejects the armenian claim of a genocide - for its entry into the european union .
ankara fears that the genocide allegations could fuel anti-turkish sentiment in international public opinion at a time when it is vying for eu membership .
erdogan said friday turkey could normalize relations with armenia at the same time as undertaking the study of the armenian massacres .
turkey had previously demanded that armenia first abandon its campaign for the recognition of the world war i massacres as genocide . dw-world.de armenian massacre clouds turkey 's eu bid tens of thousands of armenians including the president and top officials filed through the towering genocide memorial in yerevan on sunday to commemorate the 90th anniversary of mass killings by ottoman turks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 29.04.2005 impressive iran 's bundesliga connection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's mahdavikia -lrb- right -rrb- is one the bundesliga 's iranian contingent if its current impressive form continues , iran 's national soccer team should feature at the 2006 world cup in germany .
for a number of the players it will be like playing at home after another season in the bundesliga . a strong campaign in asian qualifying zone has so far seen iran installed as favorites to make it to the world cup in germany in 2006 at the expense of experienced teams such as south korea and japan . for some players within the unbeaten iranian squad , the journey to the world cup will not require much international travel .
the current success of iran can be traced to a number of players performing in the bundesliga . german influence in iran is stronger than in any other asian nation with striker vahid hashemian turning out for champions-elect bayern munich , bochum 's moharram navidkia , playmaker fereydoon zandi at kaiserslautern and hamburg sv 's mehdi mahdavikia are all playing a part in the campaign to bring their country to their adopted land to battle for the ultimate soccer prize next year . iran coach branko ivankovic has praised the bundesliga quartet and considers their contribution to be an integral part of the team 's success at the midway point of the asian zone 's third and final qualifying round .
" i am quite pleased with the german-based players who have adapted very well to the team so far .
the experience they have gained in bundesliga is important in helping the team to win matches , " the 51-year-old croatian told fifaworldcup.com. benched hashemian lethal for iran vahid ' the helicopter ' hashemian , named as such due to his presence in aerial duels , is arguably one of the most successful asian players in german soccer .
the 28-year-old forward scored 16 goals last season at his former club bochum as they recorded an impressive fifth-placed finish in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a two million euro transfer to bavarian giants bayern , however , hashemian has been restricted to substitute performances due to the impressive line-up of marksmen in the squad which includes roy makaay , claudio pizarro , josé paolo guerrero and roque santa cruz . even so , the lack of first team action has done nothing to dent his resolve or blunt his sharpness in front of goal when given the chance .
hashemian has scored four goals in the past six world cup qualifiers , including a brace that handed iran three precious points in the crucial 2-1 victory over group a favorites japan in march . " hashemian has developed into a great player after his spells with three german bundesliga clubs .
i am happy to see how quickly he fitted back into the team after his return , " ivankovic said , referring to the striker 's three-year self-imposed exile from the national team . kaiserslautern 's zandi runs midfield show fereydoon zandi is a welcome addition to the iran team .
the german-born midfielder , recently made a nationalized iranian , has given his coach a pivotal center to a powerful midfield trio , with hamburg 's mahdavikia and javad nekounam the other constituent parts . " he has done a brilliant job with the team in the past three qualifiers to date , " said ivankovic .
" what i would say is that he has a lot of potential to develop as you see he has been getting better and better game after game . "
zandi 's german style of play has added a combative edge to the team and his distribution and vision has helped iran overcome some quality opposition with commanding performances from his central role . mahdavikia an icon-in-progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdi mahdavikia despite the playmaker mantle sitting comfortably on the shoulders of the kaiserslautern man , the player that is becoming the most iconic and valuable is the emerging mehdi mahdavikia . the 26-year-old hamburg player was named asian player of the year in 2003 and has gone from strength to strength in the national team , providing the attackers with the lifeblood of their game : the incisive ball and pinpoint crosses . young star navidkia ready to break through bochum 's moharram navidkia is also a player to watch .
the former olympic team captain and 2003 footballer of the year in iran is still only 22 and has made some crucial appearances as a substitute in the national team 's world cup campaign to date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moharram navidkia with a solid front partnership of hashemian and veteran ali daei , the leading scorer in the asian qualifying tournament , navidkia is struggling to break into the team on a regular basis but ivankovic has high hopes for him and the rest of the youngsters pushing for inclusion . " i am hoping that i can pass on to the next iran coach a team based around this young generation and with five players under 23 in the current team , i believe we are heading in the right direction , " ivankovic concluded .

" it is still not the end game .
look to june , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp . but in tehran on thursday a key iranian negotiator said the islamic republic was " very pessimistic " on the eve of new talks since the european union has been dragging its feet .

" if this tendency is confirmed and the europeans do not change their attitude , i am very pessimistic , " he told afp . in the hague , iran 's foreign minister kamal kharazi said that if there were no agreement or the talks collapsed , " it is our right to restore the program " of uranium enrichment which has currently been halted for the duration of the talks . iran accusses eu three of dragging heels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is waiting for an answer from eu negotiators britain , germany and france to a proposal that would allow iran to enrich uranium , a process that makes fuel for nuclear reactors but in highly refined form what can be the explosive core of atom bombs . the european trio is holding fast , however , to its position that iran must give up on all nuclear fuel activity in order to provide " objective guarantees " that it will not make atomic weapons , diplomats said . the united states , which backs the eu diplomatic initiative but is not party to the talks , charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and must be kept from obtaining the weapons breakout capability which enrichment represents . presidential elections put deal on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani , left .
diplomats said the iranians will not be able to make a deal on the nuclear issue until they have chosen a president on june 17 , with the west hoping that former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , who is still mulling his candidacy , will be elected and will be a pragmatist . " with wider support from the mullahs , he might be able to make moves , " a european diplomat close to the talks said . the diplomat said the talks were in fact in a holding pattern but that neither side " can trumpet this and say to the world we are in a holding mode now . " a second european diplomat , also close to the talks , said that while iran may try to provoke some sort of crisis , it would not " in the midst of a presidential election make a strategic political decision to try to change the terms of this whole -lrb- negotiating -rrb- process . " iran suspended enrichment last november as a confidence-building measure to start the talks the following month with the eu , which offers tehran trade , security and technology rewards if it makes the suspension permanent . centrifuge production has ominous overtones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javad dabiran , member of the iranian restistance council presents a satellite picture of nuclear facilities in natanz , iran .
according to the text of the proposal , read to afp by a diplomat close to the talks , the iranians seek the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a sequence , or cascade , of about 2,000 centrifuges could make enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say . the first european diplomat said the europeans will get a " no " to this on friday but " camouflaged as well as possible . " " the europeans will say they are ready to discuss the proposal but not adopt it , " the diplomat said .
the diplomat said the idea was to keep the talks going through the elections . the second diplomat said the european position remained that " for objective guarantees , the europeans see nothing other than that iran stops its fuel cycle activities .

schröder added that this question would " never " be a pre-condition imposed on turkey - which rejects the armenian claim of a genocide - for its entry into the european union .
ankara fears that the genocide allegations could fuel anti-turkish sentiment in international public opinion at a time when it is vying for eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.04.2005 euro gains popularity in central europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is supplanting the koruna , forint and zloty it may be up to five years until they plan to formally adopt the euro , but many central european countries are already using the currency for an increasing number of transactions . at cashiers in many large stores there are signs that euros are accepted and stating the daily exchange rate - while business transactions are increasingly being done in euros .
on january 1 last year , slovakia introduced a new law allowing shops and restaurants to freely accept euros , four months before the country joined the european union . " until then establishments had to have special permission but more and more wanted to be able to accept payments in euros , " slovak central bank spokesman igor barat told the afp news agency . tourists make up the bulk of the euro payments , but numerous slovaks returning from holidays in the euro zone use up their money this way . " last year we saw an increase of several percent in the number of payments made in euros which is down to the increase in tourists , " petr vyhnalek , a director of retail chain globus in the czech republic , said .
" we have seen a significant number of payments in euros in prague by tourists and also in border regions by poles and germans , " vyhnalek added . countdown to the euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovenia , as the countdown begins to the euro 's expected adoption in 2007 , the government plans to introduce dual-pricing in all stores later this year .
prices are already increasingly being advertised both in slovenian tolars and euros , particularly for real estate and cars . the euro has become popular in poland 's border regions , particularly along the frontier with germany but also with ukraine and lithuania . " the euro has superseded the traditional dollar there , " stanislaw kluza , an economist with bgz bank , said . around 30 percent of domestic and export business transactions by larger czech companies are now carried out in euros , says czech economic chamber president jaromir drabek . " czech companies are increasingly using euros because of the currency 's stability compared to the fluctuating koruna exchange rate , and that proportion is set to grow , " drabek told afp . the trend is particularly strong in the automotive and chemical industries .
the czechs plan to adopt the euro in 2010 .
some slovak banks already state the euro 's rate equivalent on their clients ' koruna account statements . " this is getting slovaks used to the euro ahead of its adoption in 2009 , " said barat . euro loans on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an outside view of the hungarian parliament building in budapest .
many companies in the region have taken out loans in euros due to better interest rates .
in hungary euro-denominated retail and household loans are dramatically on the rise .
seventy percent of new corporate loans last year were in a foreign currency , predominantly euros , according to the hungarian financial supervisory authority . " the most important reasons ... are companies ' confidence in the stability of the forint exchange rate and the difference between the relatively high interest rate on forint loans and the relatively low interest rate on foreign currency denominated loans , " it said in a recent report . in 2004 , 44.5 percent of all corporate loans were foreign currency denominated -lrb- mostly euros -rrb- , up from 35 percent in 2002 , while 14.5 percent of household loans were foreign currency denominated , up from 2.9 percent in 2002 , the authority said . in slovakia train and plane tickets abroad , taxi fares and restaurant and hotel bills can all be paid in euros .
a slovenian public opinion poll rated the euro the most trusted " institution " . tourist-orientated companies in slovenia can legally accept euros .
shops near the italian or austrian border and petrol stations and motorway toll stations countrywide also accept euros . in lithuania the law already allows payments in euros and some retailers post prices in euros .
in estonia , even though accepting euros is illegal , shops display prices both in kroons and euros , to ensure a smooth transition to the euro , which estonia plans to adopt in 2007 , and customers get receipts in both currencies . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair shelves plans for quick euro entry a week ahead of the british general election on may 5 , polls suggest prime minister tony blair is all set to win a third term in power .

berlin and rome also scolded the ecb , saying high interest rates are hindering growth . following flurry of disappointing data recently and sharp downward revisions in growth forecasts by a host of other organisations , germany 's economy and labor minister wolfgang clement told a news conference in berlin that the government was cutting its growth forecast for the current year to 1.0 percent from 1.6 percent previously . berlin " is counting on growth of between 0.75 percent and 1.25 percent or a median of 1.0 percent for 2005 .
and gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- is expected to grow in range of 1.5-2.0 percent or 1.6 percent in 2006 , " clement said . " the -lrb- downward -rrb- revision takes into account the less favorable basis in the fourth quarter of 2004 and oil price developments , " he explained . earlier this week , germany 's six top think-tanks - - diw , hwwa , iw , rwi , iwh and ifo - slashed their 2005 growth forecast to just 0.7 percent from 1.5 percent previously .
the international monetary fund and the eu commission also recently slashed their german forecasts to 0.8 percent . real-world data the pessimism appears to be backed up by real economic data .
germany slipped into shallow recession at the end of last year , revised data published by the federal statistics office showed on thursday .
there seems to be little evidence that things will improve any time soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exports are pulling all the weight exports , the sole driver of growth in the past , look set to slow as the global economic upturn runs out of steam .
no new impulses can be expected on the domestic side , with unemployment stuck at just under five million and consumer demand in the doldrums for the past three years . clement insisted that activity would pick up noticeably in the first quarter of 2005 .
the government was pencilling in quarterly growth of " just over 0.5 percent " in the period from january to march , he said . he insisted that the " economic upturn will continue in the course of this year and next year " as domestic demand , previously the achilles ' heel of the economy , recovered .
companies would use strong increases in earnings to step up investment , clement said .
and household consumption would gradually pick up as taxes were reduced and the labor market turned around . italy , germany hit out at ecb germany and italy , the euro zone 's biggest and third-biggest economies , hit out at the european central bank on thursday , arguing that the current level of interest rates was too high in face of sluggish growth in the region and the strength of the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian prime minister silvio berlusconi italian prime minister silvio berlusconi launched the most virulent attack on the ecb , saying the bank 's inflation-focused policies were " destructive " and harmed the competitiveness of the 12-country euro zone . the ecb " has the objective to contain inflation , and it 's only doing that , " berlusconi said .
" it 's not working , as we would like it to , to keep the value of our currency lower with respect to others . " strong euro the euro has risen by about eight percent against the dollar over the past year , undermining european exports by making euro-zone products more expensive than rival products made outside the euro area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is trampling all over the dollar the single currency is currently changing hands at around $ 1.30 , up from $ 1.18 at its launch in 1999 .
in theory , a reduction in interest rates could clip the euro 's wings because it would make investing in euro-denominated assets less attractive . germany 's economy minister clement joined in the fray , even if he was less outspoken in his criticism of the ecb .
but he nevertheless implied that a cut in euro-zone borrowing costs could help kick-start his country 's stymied economy . the current level of euro-zone interest rates - the ecb has held its central " refi " refinancing rate steady at 2.0 percent since june 2003 - " does not reflect the economic situation in germany , " clement said . germany currently has one of the lowest inflation rates in the single currency region - 1.5 percent in april compared with an average of around 2.0 percent for the euro area as a whole - and its economy is one of the worst-performing . one size fits all ? the problem for the ecb is that it has to set interest rates for all 12 countries that share the euro and other euro-zone countries , such as ireland and spain , are enjoying much more robust growth and their inflation rates are a lot higher . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , left , and european central bank president , jean-claude trichet and while the guardian of the euro seems unlikely to raise its interest rates in the coming months , its president jean-claude trichet -lrb- photo , right -rrb- recently ruled out an easing of monetary conditions , despite the calls for lower rates . the ecb is notoriously sensitive about politicians attempting to meddle with its interest-rate decisions and there have been suggestions in the past that the ecb delayed rate cuts so as not to be seen to be bowing to political pressure . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gloomy news again for german economy instead of building on last year 's recovery , the german economy appears to be heading downhill again .

when special " trophy commissions " made up of red army experts - whose official mission was to look for cultural property stolen by the nazis - began removing and transporting art treasures from germany back to the soviet union , these fragments went with them . vocal criticism the prussian cultural heritage foundation in berlin has been vocal in its criticism of the exhibition . but the pushkin museum insists that according to international law on restitution of works of art looted during armed conflicts , the pieces belong to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is n't the first time exhibitions of so-called " trophy art " from germany have taken place in st. petersburg and moscow .
in november 1992 , the hermitage -lrb- photo -rrb- showed drawings from the bremen kunsthalle and most of the objects were exhibited again in moscow in march 1993 . the perceived recalcitrance of russia 's museums was underscored by the fact that on tuesday , the same day the latest exhibition opened , the foundation symbolically returned a work of 17th century art to russia as a gesture of reconciliation . " russia 's behavior is seriously straining our relationship and is highly detrimental to the position of germany 's museum directors , " said christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture . secret spoils the german government has been trying to reclaim its cultural property from russia for some 15 years , including the restitution of almost 200,000 works of art , two million books and about three kilometers of files . for years , russian authorities denied it was keeping secret spoils in special depots , while simultaneously maintaining that its german cultural property was legitimately owned as reparations . then , in 1992 , the promising german-russian treaty of cultural cooperation was expected to usher in a new era of amicability , but by the mid-1990s the restitution negotiations had caved in to opposition from influential russian political sectors rejecting the restitution claims , as well as pressure from nationalistic groups championing the right of the russian people to german cultural property as indemnity for its 30 million dead and the suffering and atrocities russia had to endure through nazi aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as günter nooke from the christian democrats pointed out in an interview with the berliner zeitung , the issue provides a stark contrast to the upbeat state of german-russian relations touted by chancellor schröder and president putin .

" the proposal of the turkish prime minister -lrb- recep tayyip erdogan -rrb- is good and this path should be followed , " schröder said during an interview with turkish television station ntv before his may 3-4 visit to turkey .
however the german chancellor said it was important that a " nation looks at its history with a sense of self-criticism . "
schröder added that this question would " never " be a pre-condition imposed on turkey - which rejects the armenian claim of a genocide - for its entry into the european union .
ankara fears that the genocide allegations could fuel anti-turkish sentiment in international public opinion at a time when it is vying for eu membership .
erdogan said friday turkey could normalize relations with armenia at the same time as undertaking the study of the armenian massacres .
turkey had previously demanded that armenia first abandon its campaign for the recognition of the world war i massacres as genocide . dw-world.de armenian massacre clouds turkey 's eu bid tens of thousands of armenians including the president and top officials filed through the towering genocide memorial in yerevan on sunday to commemorate the 90th anniversary of mass killings by ottoman turks .

" we have two expectations from the talks , " schröder said in a press conference with visiting new zealand prime minister helen clark . " the first is that we reinforce the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as it is now and we need to put all our efforts into that , " he said .
" the second is that there is a credible disarmament mechanism and we hope we will see movement from countries on this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clark -lrb- photo , with joschka fischer -rrb- said she hoped the meeting would focus on " striking a balance and ensuring that a country 's right to produce nuclear energy does not provide cover for developing nuclear weapons . "
she pointed out that germany , britain and france should be congratulated for their efforts on attempting to obtain guarantees from iran that it will not use its nuclear program to build weapons . focus on north korea foreign minister joschka fischer will lead the german delegation at the conference in new york which begins monday and lasts until may 27 . attended by diplomats from some 190 countries , it will re-examine the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which was first introduced in 1970 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is expected to push for discussions on tightening npt rules that have been either bent or broken by , for example , iran and north korea . north korea is set to be a major talking point at the conference .
the communist state said this month it had shut down a nuclear power plant and was preparing to re-process the plant 's spent fuel , a move that could result in the production of enough plutonium to build up to six more nuclear bombs . us in the hotseat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the us may well come in for some criticism itself .
president george bush 's track record of tinkering with international anti-nuclear rules has prompted critics to say washington is top among those undermining the authority of the npt .
bush has refused to support a test-ban treaty , threw out the anti-ballistic missile treaty with russia , and is still dragging his feet on negotiating a global treaty to end the production of fissile material for bombs . to many , washington 's perceived double standards set a bad example when it comes to negotiations with countries such as north korea and iran . the us energy department , meanwhile , is keen to promote plans to make stockpiled warheads less sensitive to ageing , thereby saving on weapons maintenance and cutting back its stores . fdp gets tough on nuclear weapons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a matter with particular relevance in germany , where the nuclear question unexpectedly reared its head again this week . in the bundestag , the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with backing from the green party , called for an immediate withdrawal of some 150 land-based us nuclear weapons still housed on german soil - a surprise move from a party generally known for its staunchly pro-american stance . but party leader guido westerwelle described the weapons as a relic of the cold war , and pointed out that the credibility of the npt depended on states coming through on their pledge to disarm . according to article ii of the npt , ratified by the us in 1970 and germany in 1975 , " each non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly , or indirectly . " " it 's time to reconsider whether their presence still serves a relevant purpose , " liberal democrat mp werner hoyer told german weekly der spiegel .
harking back to the days of the iron curtain , most of the 480 us nuclear weapons stored in europe are located in germany , strategically closest to eastern europe . the german delegation in new york , however , is not expected to raise the issue .
for the time being , it 's reluctant to rock the boat of transatlantic relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

" the proposal of the turkish prime minister -lrb- recep tayyip erdogan -rrb- is good and this path should be followed , " schröder said during an interview with turkish television station ntv before his may 3-4 visit to turkey .
however the german chancellor said it was important that a " nation looks at its history with a sense of self-criticism . "
schröder added that this question would " never " be a pre-condition imposed on turkey - which rejects the armenian claim of a genocide - for its entry into the european union .
ankara fears that the genocide allegations could fuel anti-turkish sentiment in international public opinion at a time when it is vying for eu membership .
erdogan said friday turkey could normalize relations with armenia at the same time as undertaking the study of the armenian massacres .
turkey had previously demanded that armenia first abandon its campaign for the recognition of the world war i massacres as genocide . dw-world.de armenian massacre clouds turkey 's eu bid tens of thousands of armenians including the president and top officials filed through the towering genocide memorial in yerevan on sunday to commemorate the 90th anniversary of mass killings by ottoman turks .

these days , about 10 percent of german children are classified as clinically obese and those numbers are rising . " children are eating too much and too many sweet and fatty foods , " said german minister of food and agriculture renate künast , who added that she wants to do something about it by making sure children know all about healthy eating right from kindergarten . meeting recently with us secretary of state for agriculture , eric bost , the two ministers unveiled plans to try to combat the epidemic .
in the us , roughly 17 percent of all primary school children are classified as obese , something which many attribute to the popularity of fast food and a lack of exercise .

in the us , obesity and lack of exercise are about to overtake smoking as the number one killer . one joint solution is the “ nutritional pyramid , ” officials said .
it is envisioned as an easy to understand guide to a healthy diet .
they believe it is better to prevent obesity than try to cure it and the first step is to improve dietary education . the american version of the nutritional pyramid for children is already on the internet .
visitors to the site can compile their ideal diet .
bost said he takes great pride in the initial response . “ during a 24-hour period , we had over 62 million hits to the internet site , ” he said . many measures needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setting a bad example künast hopes for a similar outcome .
she has just written a book called the “ fat maker ” and feels there is still a lot to do . “ we need to introduce a whole host of measures , in all areas of life , from kindergarten to primary school through to secondary school , and from urban development to the development of new foods , ” she said . schools are the main focus of the campaign .
künast wants children to learn how to prepare healthy meals .
but the food industry is by no means absolved of blame or responsibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.04.2005 remembering dachau großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liberators came on april 29 one of the first concentration camps to be liberated by the allies 60 years ago friday , dachau concentration camp was also among the first places in which the west was exposed to the extent of nazi brutality . with allied troops advancing across germany in the final days of world war ii , the ss began evacuating more and more nazi concentration camps .
by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .
" and the only thing that was piled up there was cheese ... we stuffed ourselves , and i have n't eaten cheese after that for i do n't know how many years .

for a number of the players it will be like playing at home after another season in the bundesliga . a strong campaign in asian qualifying zone has so far seen iran installed as favorites to make it to the world cup in germany in 2006 at the expense of experienced teams such as south korea and japan . for some players within the unbeaten iranian squad , the journey to the world cup will not require much international travel .
the current success of iran can be traced to a number of players performing in the bundesliga . german influence in iran is stronger than in any other asian nation with striker vahid hashemian turning out for champions-elect bayern munich , bochum 's moharram navidkia , playmaker fereydoon zandi at kaiserslautern and hamburg sv 's mehdi mahdavikia are all playing a part in the campaign to bring their country to their adopted land to battle for the ultimate soccer prize next year . iran coach branko ivankovic has praised the bundesliga quartet and considers their contribution to be an integral part of the team 's success at the midway point of the asian zone 's third and final qualifying round .

" we have two expectations from the talks , " schröder said in a press conference with visiting new zealand prime minister helen clark . " the first is that we reinforce the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as it is now and we need to put all our efforts into that , " he said .
" the second is that there is a credible disarmament mechanism and we hope we will see movement from countries on this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clark -lrb- photo , with joschka fischer -rrb- said she hoped the meeting would focus on " striking a balance and ensuring that a country 's right to produce nuclear energy does not provide cover for developing nuclear weapons . "
she pointed out that germany , britain and france should be congratulated for their efforts on attempting to obtain guarantees from iran that it will not use its nuclear program to build weapons . focus on north korea foreign minister joschka fischer will lead the german delegation at the conference in new york which begins monday and lasts until may 27 . attended by diplomats from some 190 countries , it will re-examine the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which was first introduced in 1970 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is expected to push for discussions on tightening npt rules that have been either bent or broken by , for example , iran and north korea . north korea is set to be a major talking point at the conference .
the communist state said this month it had shut down a nuclear power plant and was preparing to re-process the plant 's spent fuel , a move that could result in the production of enough plutonium to build up to six more nuclear bombs . us in the hotseat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the us may well come in for some criticism itself .
president george bush 's track record of tinkering with international anti-nuclear rules has prompted critics to say washington is top among those undermining the authority of the npt .
bush has refused to support a test-ban treaty , threw out the anti-ballistic missile treaty with russia , and is still dragging his feet on negotiating a global treaty to end the production of fissile material for bombs . to many , washington 's perceived double standards set a bad example when it comes to negotiations with countries such as north korea and iran . the us energy department , meanwhile , is keen to promote plans to make stockpiled warheads less sensitive to ageing , thereby saving on weapons maintenance and cutting back its stores . fdp gets tough on nuclear weapons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a matter with particular relevance in germany , where the nuclear question unexpectedly reared its head again this week . in the bundestag , the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with backing from the green party , called for an immediate withdrawal of some 150 land-based us nuclear weapons still housed on german soil - a surprise move from a party generally known for its staunchly pro-american stance . but party leader guido westerwelle described the weapons as a relic of the cold war , and pointed out that the credibility of the npt depended on states coming through on their pledge to disarm . according to article ii of the npt , ratified by the us in 1970 and germany in 1975 , " each non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly , or indirectly . " " it 's time to reconsider whether their presence still serves a relevant purpose , " liberal democrat mp werner hoyer told german weekly der spiegel .
harking back to the days of the iron curtain , most of the 480 us nuclear weapons stored in europe are located in germany , strategically closest to eastern europe . the german delegation in new york , however , is not expected to raise the issue .
for the time being , it 's reluctant to rock the boat of transatlantic relations . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german conservatives urge nuke energy rethink germany 's conservative christian social union party defends nuclear energy in the face of high oil and coal prices and demands that the government abandon its plan to close all german nuclear power plants .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .

his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .

when special " trophy commissions " made up of red army experts - whose official mission was to look for cultural property stolen by the nazis - began removing and transporting art treasures from germany back to the soviet union , these fragments went with them . vocal criticism the prussian cultural heritage foundation in berlin has been vocal in its criticism of the exhibition . but the pushkin museum insists that according to international law on restitution of works of art looted during armed conflicts , the pieces belong to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is n't the first time exhibitions of so-called " trophy art " from germany have taken place in st. petersburg and moscow .
in november 1992 , the hermitage -lrb- photo -rrb- showed drawings from the bremen kunsthalle and most of the objects were exhibited again in moscow in march 1993 . the perceived recalcitrance of russia 's museums was underscored by the fact that on tuesday , the same day the latest exhibition opened , the foundation symbolically returned a work of 17th century art to russia as a gesture of reconciliation . " russia 's behavior is seriously straining our relationship and is highly detrimental to the position of germany 's museum directors , " said christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture . secret spoils the german government has been trying to reclaim its cultural property from russia for some 15 years , including the restitution of almost 200,000 works of art , two million books and about three kilometers of files . for years , russian authorities denied it was keeping secret spoils in special depots , while simultaneously maintaining that its german cultural property was legitimately owned as reparations . then , in 1992 , the promising german-russian treaty of cultural cooperation was expected to usher in a new era of amicability , but by the mid-1990s the restitution negotiations had caved in to opposition from influential russian political sectors rejecting the restitution claims , as well as pressure from nationalistic groups championing the right of the russian people to german cultural property as indemnity for its 30 million dead and the suffering and atrocities russia had to endure through nazi aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as günter nooke from the christian democrats pointed out in an interview with the berliner zeitung , the issue provides a stark contrast to the upbeat state of german-russian relations touted by chancellor schröder and president putin .

" it is still not the end game .
look to june , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp . but in tehran on thursday a key iranian negotiator said the islamic republic was " very pessimistic " on the eve of new talks since the european union has been dragging its feet . " up until now and from the start of the process -lrb- in december -rrb- , especially since the paris meeting -lrb- march 23 -rrb- , the europeans have not undertaken any serious step to bring it to a close , " said hossein mussavian , spokesman for the negotiating team . " if this tendency is confirmed and the europeans do not change their attitude , i am very pessimistic , " he told afp . in the hague , iran 's foreign minister kamal kharazi said that if there were no agreement or the talks collapsed , " it is our right to restore the program " of uranium enrichment which has currently been halted for the duration of the talks . iran accusses eu three of dragging heels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is waiting for an answer from eu negotiators britain , germany and france to a proposal that would allow iran to enrich uranium , a process that makes fuel for nuclear reactors but in highly refined form what can be the explosive core of atom bombs . the european trio is holding fast , however , to its position that iran must give up on all nuclear fuel activity in order to provide " objective guarantees " that it will not make atomic weapons , diplomats said . the united states , which backs the eu diplomatic initiative but is not party to the talks , charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and must be kept from obtaining the weapons breakout capability which enrichment represents . presidential elections put deal on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani , left .
diplomats said the iranians will not be able to make a deal on the nuclear issue until they have chosen a president on june 17 , with the west hoping that former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , who is still mulling his candidacy , will be elected and will be a pragmatist . " with wider support from the mullahs , he might be able to make moves , " a european diplomat close to the talks said . the diplomat said the talks were in fact in a holding pattern but that neither side " can trumpet this and say to the world we are in a holding mode now . " a second european diplomat , also close to the talks , said that while iran may try to provoke some sort of crisis , it would not " in the midst of a presidential election make a strategic political decision to try to change the terms of this whole -lrb- negotiating -rrb- process . " iran suspended enrichment last november as a confidence-building measure to start the talks the following month with the eu , which offers tehran trade , security and technology rewards if it makes the suspension permanent . centrifuge production has ominous overtones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javad dabiran , member of the iranian restistance council presents a satellite picture of nuclear facilities in natanz , iran .
according to the text of the proposal , read to afp by a diplomat close to the talks , the iranians seek the " assembly , installation and testing of 3,000 centrifuges in natanz , " the site where iran wants to build an enrichment plant and has already set up a pilot project of 164 centrifuges . a sequence , or cascade , of about 2,000 centrifuges could make enough highly enriched uranium in a year to make one atom bomb , experts say . the first european diplomat said the europeans will get a " no " to this on friday but " camouflaged as well as possible . " " the europeans will say they are ready to discuss the proposal but not adopt it , " the diplomat said .
the diplomat said the idea was to keep the talks going through the elections . the second diplomat said the european position remained that " for objective guarantees , the europeans see nothing other than that iran stops its fuel cycle activities .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .
" and the only thing that was piled up there was cheese ... we stuffed ourselves , and i have n't eaten cheese after that for i do n't know how many years .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .
" and the only thing that was piled up there was cheese ... we stuffed ourselves , and i have n't eaten cheese after that for i do n't know how many years .

the 28-year-old forward scored 16 goals last season at his former club bochum as they recorded an impressive fifth-placed finish in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a two million euro transfer to bavarian giants bayern , however , hashemian has been restricted to substitute performances due to the impressive line-up of marksmen in the squad which includes roy makaay , claudio pizarro , josé paolo guerrero and roque santa cruz . even so , the lack of first team action has done nothing to dent his resolve or blunt his sharpness in front of goal when given the chance .
hashemian has scored four goals in the past six world cup qualifiers , including a brace that handed iran three precious points in the crucial 2-1 victory over group a favorites japan in march . " hashemian has developed into a great player after his spells with three german bundesliga clubs .
i am happy to see how quickly he fitted back into the team after his return , " ivankovic said , referring to the striker 's three-year self-imposed exile from the national team . kaiserslautern 's zandi runs midfield show fereydoon zandi is a welcome addition to the iran team .
the german-born midfielder , recently made a nationalized iranian , has given his coach a pivotal center to a powerful midfield trio , with hamburg 's mahdavikia and javad nekounam the other constituent parts . " he has done a brilliant job with the team in the past three qualifiers to date , " said ivankovic .
" what i would say is that he has a lot of potential to develop as you see he has been getting better and better game after game . "
zandi 's german style of play has added a combative edge to the team and his distribution and vision has helped iran overcome some quality opposition with commanding performances from his central role . mahdavikia an icon-in-progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdi mahdavikia despite the playmaker mantle sitting comfortably on the shoulders of the kaiserslautern man , the player that is becoming the most iconic and valuable is the emerging mehdi mahdavikia . the 26-year-old hamburg player was named asian player of the year in 2003 and has gone from strength to strength in the national team , providing the attackers with the lifeblood of their game : the incisive ball and pinpoint crosses . young star navidkia ready to break through bochum 's moharram navidkia is also a player to watch .
the former olympic team captain and 2003 footballer of the year in iran is still only 22 and has made some crucial appearances as a substitute in the national team 's world cup campaign to date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moharram navidkia with a solid front partnership of hashemian and veteran ali daei , the leading scorer in the asian qualifying tournament , navidkia is struggling to break into the team on a regular basis but ivankovic has high hopes for him and the rest of the youngsters pushing for inclusion . " i am hoping that i can pass on to the next iran coach a team based around this young generation and with five players under 23 in the current team , i believe we are heading in the right direction , " ivankovic concluded .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .
" and the only thing that was piled up there was cheese ... we stuffed ourselves , and i have n't eaten cheese after that for i do n't know how many years .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .

" it is still not the end game .
look to june , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp . but in tehran on thursday a key iranian negotiator said the islamic republic was " very pessimistic " on the eve of new talks since the european union has been dragging its feet . " up until now and from the start of the process -lrb- in december -rrb- , especially since the paris meeting -lrb- march 23 -rrb- , the europeans have not undertaken any serious step to bring it to a close , " said hossein mussavian , spokesman for the negotiating team . " if this tendency is confirmed and the europeans do not change their attitude , i am very pessimistic , " he told afp . in the hague , iran 's foreign minister kamal kharazi said that if there were no agreement or the talks collapsed , " it is our right to restore the program " of uranium enrichment which has currently been halted for the duration of the talks . iran accusses eu three of dragging heels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is waiting for an answer from eu negotiators britain , germany and france to a proposal that would allow iran to enrich uranium , a process that makes fuel for nuclear reactors but in highly refined form what can be the explosive core of atom bombs . the european trio is holding fast , however , to its position that iran must give up on all nuclear fuel activity in order to provide " objective guarantees " that it will not make atomic weapons , diplomats said . the united states , which backs the eu diplomatic initiative but is not party to the talks , charges that iran is secretly developing nuclear weapons and must be kept from obtaining the weapons breakout capability which enrichment represents . presidential elections put deal on hold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iranian president ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani , left .
diplomats said the iranians will not be able to make a deal on the nuclear issue until they have chosen a president on june 17 , with the west hoping that former iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani -lrb- photo , left -rrb- , who is still mulling his candidacy , will be elected and will be a pragmatist . " with wider support from the mullahs , he might be able to make moves , " a european diplomat close to the talks said . the diplomat said the talks were in fact in a holding pattern but that neither side " can trumpet this and say to the world we are in a holding mode now .

" it is still not the end game .
look to june , " a european diplomat close to the talks told afp . but in tehran on thursday a key iranian negotiator said the islamic republic was " very pessimistic " on the eve of new talks since the european union has been dragging its feet .

" we have two expectations from the talks , " schröder said in a press conference with visiting new zealand prime minister helen clark . " the first is that we reinforce the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as it is now and we need to put all our efforts into that , " he said .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .

his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .

i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .
" and the only thing that was piled up there was cheese ... we stuffed ourselves , and i have n't eaten cheese after that for i do n't know how many years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 29.04.2005 impressive iran 's bundesliga connection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's mahdavikia -lrb- right -rrb- is one the bundesliga 's iranian contingent if its current impressive form continues , iran 's national soccer team should feature at the 2006 world cup in germany .
for a number of the players it will be like playing at home after another season in the bundesliga . a strong campaign in asian qualifying zone has so far seen iran installed as favorites to make it to the world cup in germany in 2006 at the expense of experienced teams such as south korea and japan . for some players within the unbeaten iranian squad , the journey to the world cup will not require much international travel .
the current success of iran can be traced to a number of players performing in the bundesliga . german influence in iran is stronger than in any other asian nation with striker vahid hashemian turning out for champions-elect bayern munich , bochum 's moharram navidkia , playmaker fereydoon zandi at kaiserslautern and hamburg sv 's mehdi mahdavikia are all playing a part in the campaign to bring their country to their adopted land to battle for the ultimate soccer prize next year . iran coach branko ivankovic has praised the bundesliga quartet and considers their contribution to be an integral part of the team 's success at the midway point of the asian zone 's third and final qualifying round .
" i am quite pleased with the german-based players who have adapted very well to the team so far .
the experience they have gained in bundesliga is important in helping the team to win matches , " the 51-year-old croatian told fifaworldcup.com. benched hashemian lethal for iran vahid ' the helicopter ' hashemian , named as such due to his presence in aerial duels , is arguably one of the most successful asian players in german soccer .
the 28-year-old forward scored 16 goals last season at his former club bochum as they recorded an impressive fifth-placed finish in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a two million euro transfer to bavarian giants bayern , however , hashemian has been restricted to substitute performances due to the impressive line-up of marksmen in the squad which includes roy makaay , claudio pizarro , josé paolo guerrero and roque santa cruz . even so , the lack of first team action has done nothing to dent his resolve or blunt his sharpness in front of goal when given the chance .
hashemian has scored four goals in the past six world cup qualifiers , including a brace that handed iran three precious points in the crucial 2-1 victory over group a favorites japan in march . " hashemian has developed into a great player after his spells with three german bundesliga clubs .
i am happy to see how quickly he fitted back into the team after his return , " ivankovic said , referring to the striker 's three-year self-imposed exile from the national team . kaiserslautern 's zandi runs midfield show fereydoon zandi is a welcome addition to the iran team .
the german-born midfielder , recently made a nationalized iranian , has given his coach a pivotal center to a powerful midfield trio , with hamburg 's mahdavikia and javad nekounam the other constituent parts . " he has done a brilliant job with the team in the past three qualifiers to date , " said ivankovic .
" what i would say is that he has a lot of potential to develop as you see he has been getting better and better game after game . "
zandi 's german style of play has added a combative edge to the team and his distribution and vision has helped iran overcome some quality opposition with commanding performances from his central role . mahdavikia an icon-in-progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdi mahdavikia despite the playmaker mantle sitting comfortably on the shoulders of the kaiserslautern man , the player that is becoming the most iconic and valuable is the emerging mehdi mahdavikia . the 26-year-old hamburg player was named asian player of the year in 2003 and has gone from strength to strength in the national team , providing the attackers with the lifeblood of their game : the incisive ball and pinpoint crosses . young star navidkia ready to break through bochum 's moharram navidkia is also a player to watch .
the former olympic team captain and 2003 footballer of the year in iran is still only 22 and has made some crucial appearances as a substitute in the national team 's world cup campaign to date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moharram navidkia with a solid front partnership of hashemian and veteran ali daei , the leading scorer in the asian qualifying tournament , navidkia is struggling to break into the team on a regular basis but ivankovic has high hopes for him and the rest of the youngsters pushing for inclusion . " i am hoping that i can pass on to the next iran coach a team based around this young generation and with five players under 23 in the current team , i believe we are heading in the right direction , " ivankovic concluded .
if things continue as they are , that direction will be towards germany and the 2006 world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rankings " a joke " as germany slip to 20th jürgen klinsmann has branded the fifa world ranking system " a bad joke " after germany slipped to 20th place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 29.04.2005 impressive iran 's bundesliga connection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's mahdavikia -lrb- right -rrb- is one the bundesliga 's iranian contingent if its current impressive form continues , iran 's national soccer team should feature at the 2006 world cup in germany .
for a number of the players it will be like playing at home after another season in the bundesliga . a strong campaign in asian qualifying zone has so far seen iran installed as favorites to make it to the world cup in germany in 2006 at the expense of experienced teams such as south korea and japan . for some players within the unbeaten iranian squad , the journey to the world cup will not require much international travel .
the current success of iran can be traced to a number of players performing in the bundesliga . german influence in iran is stronger than in any other asian nation with striker vahid hashemian turning out for champions-elect bayern munich , bochum 's moharram navidkia , playmaker fereydoon zandi at kaiserslautern and hamburg sv 's mehdi mahdavikia are all playing a part in the campaign to bring their country to their adopted land to battle for the ultimate soccer prize next year . iran coach branko ivankovic has praised the bundesliga quartet and considers their contribution to be an integral part of the team 's success at the midway point of the asian zone 's third and final qualifying round .
" i am quite pleased with the german-based players who have adapted very well to the team so far .
the experience they have gained in bundesliga is important in helping the team to win matches , " the 51-year-old croatian told fifaworldcup.com. benched hashemian lethal for iran vahid ' the helicopter ' hashemian , named as such due to his presence in aerial duels , is arguably one of the most successful asian players in german soccer .
the 28-year-old forward scored 16 goals last season at his former club bochum as they recorded an impressive fifth-placed finish in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a two million euro transfer to bavarian giants bayern , however , hashemian has been restricted to substitute performances due to the impressive line-up of marksmen in the squad which includes roy makaay , claudio pizarro , josé paolo guerrero and roque santa cruz . even so , the lack of first team action has done nothing to dent his resolve or blunt his sharpness in front of goal when given the chance .
hashemian has scored four goals in the past six world cup qualifiers , including a brace that handed iran three precious points in the crucial 2-1 victory over group a favorites japan in march . " hashemian has developed into a great player after his spells with three german bundesliga clubs .
i am happy to see how quickly he fitted back into the team after his return , " ivankovic said , referring to the striker 's three-year self-imposed exile from the national team . kaiserslautern 's zandi runs midfield show fereydoon zandi is a welcome addition to the iran team .
the german-born midfielder , recently made a nationalized iranian , has given his coach a pivotal center to a powerful midfield trio , with hamburg 's mahdavikia and javad nekounam the other constituent parts . " he has done a brilliant job with the team in the past three qualifiers to date , " said ivankovic .
" what i would say is that he has a lot of potential to develop as you see he has been getting better and better game after game . "
zandi 's german style of play has added a combative edge to the team and his distribution and vision has helped iran overcome some quality opposition with commanding performances from his central role . mahdavikia an icon-in-progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehdi mahdavikia despite the playmaker mantle sitting comfortably on the shoulders of the kaiserslautern man , the player that is becoming the most iconic and valuable is the emerging mehdi mahdavikia . the 26-year-old hamburg player was named asian player of the year in 2003 and has gone from strength to strength in the national team , providing the attackers with the lifeblood of their game : the incisive ball and pinpoint crosses . young star navidkia ready to break through bochum 's moharram navidkia is also a player to watch .
the former olympic team captain and 2003 footballer of the year in iran is still only 22 and has made some crucial appearances as a substitute in the national team 's world cup campaign to date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moharram navidkia with a solid front partnership of hashemian and veteran ali daei , the leading scorer in the asian qualifying tournament , navidkia is struggling to break into the team on a regular basis but ivankovic has high hopes for him and the rest of the youngsters pushing for inclusion . " i am hoping that i can pass on to the next iran coach a team based around this young generation and with five players under 23 in the current team , i believe we are heading in the right direction , " ivankovic concluded .
if things continue as they are , that direction will be towards germany and the 2006 world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rankings " a joke " as germany slip to 20th jürgen klinsmann has branded the fifa world ranking system " a bad joke " after germany slipped to 20th place .

by emptying the camps of prisoners , the nazis hoped to conceal from the world the atrocities they had committed . in late april 1945 , martin gottfried weiss , the commandant of dachau , received an order to evacuate the camp so that none of the inmates would fall into the hands of the approaching allied forces .
on april 26 , nearly 1,800 prisoners were put on a train and around 7,000 others were forced on a march southward to the mountains .
many of the feeble and sick prisoners died from exhaustion during the march , while others were simply murdered by the ss along the way , or else died in allied bomber attacks . one of the prisoners who survived this " death march " from dachau was wolf pakula , a polish jew who later immigrated to the united states . " in dachau , we stayed there and then they sent us on the last march - we marched all the way almost to the swiss border , " he said .
" on may the second , we got out in the woods , where we were sleeping at night and the guards were gone .
i went on the road and i saw an american tank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most escaped german guards escaped most of the german guards who escaped before the arrival of the us army were never found or brought to justice .
by the time the americans had come across the prisoners on the last march south of dachau , other us soldiers had already entered the camp itself . reuben lewis was another inmate at dachau .
his family were jews from latvia and lithuania , and virtually all of them perished in the holocaust .
lewis also remembers seeing the first us soldiers arrive at the camp and how most of the ss guards managed to flee before they could be captured . " we saw scouts , american scouts coming from two different sides , " he recalled .
" our camp was based on a luftwaffe airport .
and they came , and at that point the german guards dropped their guns and called out to us that we are free people , and they escaped . " shocked at what they found when the american soldiers finally entered dachau , the majority of them were not prepared for what they found : thousands of emaciated corpses , littered around the camp .
the germans had run out of coal to burn the bodies , so they had been stacked in front of the crematorium and elsewhere around the camp in the last days before dachau was liberated . adding further to the disturbing atmosphere was a railroad train containing 40 boxcars , each of them overflowing with decomposing human corpses - more than 2,000 men , women and children in tattered concentration camp uniforms or completely naked .
most had suffocated or starved to death while being evacuated from the buchenwald concentration camp to dachau several weeks earlier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horrifying discovery nearly all of the american soldiers ' accounts of dachau 's liberation attempted to describe the overwhelming stench of death and sickness that permeated the camp . mixed in with the dead were more than 30,000 filthy and extremely malnourished surviving prisoners , crowded into a camp originally designed to house 5,000 people .
many of the inmates at dachau were also suffering from an epidemic of typhus , or other diseases . hunger was another pressing issue . " we went to the canteen , to the german canteen , and we stole food , " lewis said .

" we have two expectations from the talks , " schröder said in a press conference with visiting new zealand prime minister helen clark . " the first is that we reinforce the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as it is now and we need to put all our efforts into that , " he said .
" the second is that there is a credible disarmament mechanism and we hope we will see movement from countries on this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clark -lrb- photo , with joschka fischer -rrb- said she hoped the meeting would focus on " striking a balance and ensuring that a country 's right to produce nuclear energy does not provide cover for developing nuclear weapons . "
she pointed out that germany , britain and france should be congratulated for their efforts on attempting to obtain guarantees from iran that it will not use its nuclear program to build weapons . focus on north korea foreign minister joschka fischer will lead the german delegation at the conference in new york which begins monday and lasts until may 27 . attended by diplomats from some 190 countries , it will re-examine the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , which was first introduced in 1970 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is expected to push for discussions on tightening npt rules that have been either bent or broken by , for example , iran and north korea . north korea is set to be a major talking point at the conference .
the communist state said this month it had shut down a nuclear power plant and was preparing to re-process the plant 's spent fuel , a move that could result in the production of enough plutonium to build up to six more nuclear bombs . us in the hotseat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the us may well come in for some criticism itself .
president george bush 's track record of tinkering with international anti-nuclear rules has prompted critics to say washington is top among those undermining the authority of the npt .
bush has refused to support a test-ban treaty , threw out the anti-ballistic missile treaty with russia , and is still dragging his feet on negotiating a global treaty to end the production of fissile material for bombs . to many , washington 's perceived double standards set a bad example when it comes to negotiations with countries such as north korea and iran . the us energy department , meanwhile , is keen to promote plans to make stockpiled warheads less sensitive to ageing , thereby saving on weapons maintenance and cutting back its stores . fdp gets tough on nuclear weapons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a matter with particular relevance in germany , where the nuclear question unexpectedly reared its head again this week . in the bundestag , the opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with backing from the green party , called for an immediate withdrawal of some 150 land-based us nuclear weapons still housed on german soil - a surprise move from a party generally known for its staunchly pro-american stance . but party leader guido westerwelle described the weapons as a relic of the cold war , and pointed out that the credibility of the npt depended on states coming through on their pledge to disarm . according to article ii of the npt , ratified by the us in 1970 and germany in 1975 , " each non-nuclear-weapon state party to the treaty undertakes not to receive the transfer from any transferor whatsoever of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or of control over such weapons or explosive devices directly , or indirectly . " " it 's time to reconsider whether their presence still serves a relevant purpose , " liberal democrat mp werner hoyer told german weekly der spiegel .
harking back to the days of the iron curtain , most of the 480 us nuclear weapons stored in europe are located in germany , strategically closest to eastern europe . the german delegation in new york , however , is not expected to raise the issue .

when special " trophy commissions " made up of red army experts - whose official mission was to look for cultural property stolen by the nazis - began removing and transporting art treasures from germany back to the soviet union , these fragments went with them . vocal criticism the prussian cultural heritage foundation in berlin has been vocal in its criticism of the exhibition . but the pushkin museum insists that according to international law on restitution of works of art looted during armed conflicts , the pieces belong to russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is n't the first time exhibitions of so-called " trophy art " from germany have taken place in st. petersburg and moscow .
in november 1992 , the hermitage -lrb- photo -rrb- showed drawings from the bremen kunsthalle and most of the objects were exhibited again in moscow in march 1993 . the perceived recalcitrance of russia 's museums was underscored by the fact that on tuesday , the same day the latest exhibition opened , the foundation symbolically returned a work of 17th century art to russia as a gesture of reconciliation . " russia 's behavior is seriously straining our relationship and is highly detrimental to the position of germany 's museum directors , " said christina weiss , state secretary for media and culture . secret spoils the german government has been trying to reclaim its cultural property from russia for some 15 years , including the restitution of almost 200,000 works of art , two million books and about three kilometers of files . for years , russian authorities denied it was keeping secret spoils in special depots , while simultaneously maintaining that its german cultural property was legitimately owned as reparations . then , in 1992 , the promising german-russian treaty of cultural cooperation was expected to usher in a new era of amicability , but by the mid-1990s the restitution negotiations had caved in to opposition from influential russian political sectors rejecting the restitution claims , as well as pressure from nationalistic groups championing the right of the russian people to german cultural property as indemnity for its 30 million dead and the suffering and atrocities russia had to endure through nazi aggression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as günter nooke from the christian democrats pointed out in an interview with the berliner zeitung , the issue provides a stark contrast to the upbeat state of german-russian relations touted by chancellor schröder and president putin .

the secretary of state restated the us position in talks on the regionally divisive issue with chilean president ricardo lagos in santiago .
a new leader to the post , vacant since october , will be elected on monday .
earlier this month , candidates from mexico and chile were deadlocked on 17 votes each after five rounds of voting .
regional split traditionally , the us-backed candidate wins the leadership of the organisation , but it might not be the case this time .
towards the end of her first tour of south america , ms rice was confronted with the tricky issue of the upcoming leadership ballot .
the us originally backed a candidate from el salvador , but after he withdrew from lack of support , it switched to mexico .
the mexican candidate , foreign minister luis ernesto derbez , is seen as more conservative than chile 's interior minister jose miguel insulza , who is a member of the socialist party .
more importantly , the region appears to be splitting along geographic lines .
in the first ballot , most of south america and the caribbean supported the chilean candidate , while central and north america backed mexico .
ms rice reiterated us support for the mexican candidate during a news conference in santiago , but also praised the chilean nomination .
she acknowledged that the leadership process had been divisive .
she said : " our task has to be to talk , to discuss , how we might move forward on a basis that once again brings us to unity . "
ms rice is visiting chile for the first time as secretary of state , but it appears her tour could be dominated by last-minute lobbying for the next oas secretary general .

the secretary of state restated the us position in talks on the regionally divisive issue with chilean president ricardo lagos in santiago .
a new leader to the post , vacant since october , will be elected on monday .
earlier this month , candidates from mexico and chile were deadlocked on 17 votes each after five rounds of voting .
regional split traditionally , the us-backed candidate wins the leadership of the organisation , but it might not be the case this time .
towards the end of her first tour of south america , ms rice was confronted with the tricky issue of the upcoming leadership ballot .
the us originally backed a candidate from el salvador , but after he withdrew from lack of support , it switched to mexico .
the mexican candidate , foreign minister luis ernesto derbez , is seen as more conservative than chile 's interior minister jose miguel insulza , who is a member of the socialist party .
more importantly , the region appears to be splitting along geographic lines .
in the first ballot , most of south america and the caribbean supported the chilean candidate , while central and north america backed mexico .
ms rice reiterated us support for the mexican candidate during a news conference in santiago , but also praised the chilean nomination .
she acknowledged that the leadership process had been divisive .
she said : " our task has to be to talk , to discuss , how we might move forward on a basis that once again brings us to unity . "

mike floate has been a swans fan since 1972 when his family moved to the city when he was a youngster .
now a teacher in london , he also runs a publishing firm around his 10,000 photo archive of grounds and stadia .
he is collaborating on a book about football grounds in south wales .
he explains what the vetch means to him .
" i 'm just a normal bloke but when i join with the swans fans in singing ' swansea , oh swansea , oh city , say i , stand here on the north bank ' til the day i die ' i go all emotional .
a shiver goes up my spine and i 'll admit to having wiped away a tear in the past - not the usual reaction to seeing a game , even at your favourite ground .
up until the 1990s most fans would have thought the swans would play at the vetch forever .
now there are just a few final games to be staged there .
i first entered the vetch field in august 1972 .
manchester city were to play a friendly and malcolm allison invited the locals into the ground to watch city train . "
goodness knows why , but i remember deciding to try out each area game by game " i took in the view of my new adopted team from the main stand , but knew instinctively that the place to watch from would be the enormous covered terrace opposite .
not until later did i fully appreciate the special atmosphere of the ground , shoe-horned in among simple terraced houses , the territorial army depot and prison peering over the stand , between the ground and the beach .
the vetch field was rare at the time in that spectators could not move around the ground .
once you had decided to watch from a section you were there for the full 90 minutes .
goodness knows why , but i remember deciding to try out each area game by game .
in the 1970s the western end of the main stand was still a covered terrace , which extended a short distance around the corner .
hardly anyone ever stood there , which made for a strange feeling of detachment from the game .
i then tried the east bank .
this was roughly terraced , around 25 steps up at its highest point between the goal and the main stand .
it cost less to stand there , and with welsh winters being exceptionally wet i soon went back to the north bank .
click here to read more about the end of an era in swansea at the west end of the ground was a brilliant old double-decker stand , with a shallow terrace underneath .
i saw wales beat luxembourg 5-0 from this end - but if you kept dry under the roof any lofted ball out of defence went out of sight .
access to the stand was up a dark stairwell , the red bricks adding to the dingy atmosphere .
the seats were unreserved - surely the way to bring back some atmosphere in all-seated stadia ? - and having paid extra for the privilege i could n't see why anyone would sit anywhere other than the back row .
i only saw one game from there - and also the who on their stadium tour - but can visualise the scene even now .
the view was superb , the height and close proximity to the pitch making it a great place from which to watch .
back on the north bank crowds were at first small enough for fans to move up the side towards the goal being attacked , or to make use of the height further back on the terrace at will .
even with a small crowd the noise was amazing .
i can still put myself back crammed into the bank as alan curtis jinked his way through the leeds defence to seal a 5-1 debut win in division 1 - the vetch 's finest hour ?
the only change made to this day has been that the rear third of the terrace has been fenced off , the part which extended the bank out over the rear of the old ash bank having been declared unsafe .
the east terrace was developed as the team gained successive promotions in the late 1970s , the double-decker built there being a modern version of the west stand , with a small terrace underneath . "
i wo n't go to the last game - i 'd be far too emotional by the end " one floodlight was replaced with an angled roof-mounted pylon as the stand turned around the corner towards the main stand .
the intention was to demolish this and continue the new stand along the whole side .
however , the plan was soon forgotten and the stand left incomplete when the finances went wrong and the team slid back down the leagues as rapidly as they had risen .
over the years seats have been put along the full length of the main stand , with the small section of terrace which went round the corner being sectioned off .
the roof was taken off the west stand for safety reasons but the terrace underneath remained unaltered as the old seating deck was covered over and became the new roof .
now , no more will fans be able to see all the way to the mumbles from inside the ground on a clear day , the floodlights seen from almost five miles across the bay , or down from the 600 feet heights of townhill .
since 1912 the odd-shaped field , which once was used to store coal for the local gasworks , grew then declined to become an anachronistic reminder of how football used to be staged .
however clever the architects of the new white rock stadium are they will never be able to recreate the intimacy and sense of belonging which is what i will remember the vetch field for .
i wo n't go to the last game - i 'd be far too emotional by the end . "

click here to read more about the end of an era in swansea at the west end of the ground was a brilliant old double-decker stand , with a shallow terrace underneath .
i saw wales beat luxembourg 5-0 from this end - but if you kept dry under the roof any lofted ball out of defence went out of sight .
access to the stand was up a dark stairwell , the red bricks adding to the dingy atmosphere .
the seats were unreserved - surely the way to bring back some atmosphere in all-seated stadia ? - and having paid extra for the privilege i could n't see why anyone would sit anywhere other than the back row .
i only saw one game from there - and also the who on their stadium tour - but can visualise the scene even now .
the view was superb , the height and close proximity to the pitch making it a great place from which to watch .
back on the north bank crowds were at first small enough for fans to move up the side towards the goal being attacked , or to make use of the height further back on the terrace at will .
even with a small crowd the noise was amazing .
i can still put myself back crammed into the bank as alan curtis jinked his way through the leeds defence to seal a 5-1 debut win in division 1 - the vetch 's finest hour ?
the only change made to this day has been that the rear third of the terrace has been fenced off , the part which extended the bank out over the rear of the old ash bank having been declared unsafe .
the east terrace was developed as the team gained successive promotions in the late 1970s , the double-decker built there being a modern version of the west stand , with a small terrace underneath .
i wo n't go to the last game - i 'd be far too emotional by the end one floodlight was replaced with an angled roof-mounted pylon as the stand turned around the corner towards the main stand .
the intention was to demolish this and continue the new stand along the whole side .
however , the plan was soon forgotten and the stand left incomplete when the finances went wrong and the team slid back down the leagues as rapidly as they had risen .
over the years seats have been put along the full length of the main stand , with the small section of terrace which went round the corner being sectioned off .
the roof was taken off the west stand for safety reasons but the terrace underneath remained unaltered as the old seating deck was covered over and became the new roof .
now , no more will fans be able to see all the way to the mumbles from inside the ground on a clear day , the floodlights seen from almost five miles across the bay , or down from the 600 feet heights of townhill .
since 1912 the odd-shaped field , which once was used to store coal for the local gasworks , grew then declined to become an anachronistic reminder of how football used to be staged .
however clever the architects of the new white rock stadium are they will never be able to recreate the intimacy and sense of belonging which is what i will remember the vetch field for .
i wo n't go to the last game - i 'd be far too emotional by the end . "

the joint university of bristol and university of sheffield team found a 10-year difference in life expectancy between the best and worst areas .
despite attempts to reverse the trend , they said the gap was still rising but this could change in coming years .
glasgow had the worst life expectancy , 72.9 years , compared to kensington and chelsea in london on 82.4 .
a labour spokeswoman said the party disagreed with the conclusions .
the researchers looked at the life expectancy for 10 different poverty groups from 1992 to 2003 although the report admitted the gap had been widening since the 1980s .
they found over that period the gap had widened by 0.15 of a year , with the poorest living 76.2 years on average while the wealthiest lived until 80.3 years old .
' income inequalities ' glasgow city has the worst life expectancy , 72.9 years , compared to kensington and chelsea in london on 82.4 .
report co-author professor danny dorling said he could not be certain what had caused the increase , but it was most likely to be poverty .
he said : " as with all these things it is hard to explain why it is happening , but we know that income inequalities have increased and it seems this has been mirrored by health inequalities .
" if that is true , we might see a narrowing of the gap as the latest income figures show that has narrowed recently . "
areas with lowest life expectancy 72.9 - glasgow city 74.2 - inverclyde 74.3 - west dunbartonshire 74.8 - north lanarkshire 74.8 - manchester the paper , published in the british medical journal , said the income and wealth inequalities had been widening since the 1980s - the poorest 10 % in society now received 3 % of the nation 's total income , whereas the richest tenth obtained more than a quarter .
karen jochelson , of the king 's fund , a health think-tank , agreed the gap was widening .
" the government came in with a courageous platform but they did not go an extra step and tackle income equality , that was the problem . "
' two failures ' in 2001 the government said it would reduce the gap in infant mortality and life expectancy by 2010 .
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " at the heart of the inequality are two failures .
" firstly , the government has failed to prioritise public health - services are fragmented and labour have delivered weak , inconsistent messages .
areas with highest life expectancy 82.4 - kensington and chelsea 81.8 - east dorset 81.7 - hart 81.4 - guildford 81.4 - rutland " secondly , gps have not been given enough control to deliver changes . "
and liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow added : " prevention is as important as cure .
labour has dithered and delayed for eight years while sexual infections have rocketed , binge drinking is on the rise and smoking levels have remained about the same for over a decade . "
but a labour spokeswoman said : " if you look at areas we have focused on such as heart disease and cancer , the gap has really narrowed .
" it is just plain wrong to say it is the worst since victorian times , there was not even a health service then . "

the joint university of bristol and university of sheffield team found a 10-year difference in life expectancy between the best and worst areas .
despite attempts to reverse the trend , they said the gap was still rising but this could change in coming years .
glasgow had the worst life expectancy , 72.9 years , compared to kensington and chelsea in london on 82.4 .
a labour spokeswoman said the party disagreed with the conclusions .
the researchers looked at the life expectancy for 10 different poverty groups from 1992 to 2003 although the report admitted the gap had been widening since the 1980s .
they found over that period the gap had widened by 0.15 of a year , with the poorest living 76.2 years on average while the wealthiest lived until 80.3 years old .
' income inequalities ' glasgow city has the worst life expectancy , 72.9 years , compared to kensington and chelsea in london on 82.4 .
report co-author professor danny dorling said he could not be certain what had caused the increase , but it was most likely to be poverty .
he said : " as with all these things it is hard to explain why it is happening , but we know that income inequalities have increased and it seems this has been mirrored by health inequalities .
" if that is true , we might see a narrowing of the gap as the latest income figures show that has narrowed recently . "
areas with lowest life expectancy 72.9 - glasgow city 74.2 - inverclyde 74.3 - west dunbartonshire 74.8 - north lanarkshire 74.8 - manchester the paper , published in the british medical journal , said the income and wealth inequalities had been widening since the 1980s - the poorest 10 % in society now received 3 % of the nation 's total income , whereas the richest tenth obtained more than a quarter .
karen jochelson , of the king 's fund , a health think-tank , agreed the gap was widening .
" the government came in with a courageous platform but they did not go an extra step and tackle income equality , that was the problem . "
' two failures ' in 2001 the government said it would reduce the gap in infant mortality and life expectancy by 2010 .
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " at the heart of the inequality are two failures .
" firstly , the government has failed to prioritise public health - services are fragmented and labour have delivered weak , inconsistent messages .
areas with highest life expectancy 82.4 - kensington and chelsea 81.8 - east dorset 81.7 - hart 81.4 - guildford 81.4 - rutland " secondly , gps have not been given enough control to deliver changes . "
and liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow added : " prevention is as important as cure .
labour has dithered and delayed for eight years while sexual infections have rocketed , binge drinking is on the rise and smoking levels have remained about the same for over a decade . "
but a labour spokeswoman said : " if you look at areas we have focused on such as heart disease and cancer , the gap has really narrowed .
" it is just plain wrong to say it is the worst since victorian times , there was not even a health service then . "

narrow cobbled streets hug the coastline , lined on both sides by rows of terraced cottages painted in bright pastels , sporting names like the moorings and mariner 's cottage .
it 's an idyllic spot , in earlier times a close-knit fishing community .
but nowadays there 's one thing missing : people .
neal hotchkiss , a 25-year-old builder and lifeboat volunteer , grew up here .
he remembers a bustling community where everyone knew everyone else .
but now the lane where he and his fiancée hayley rent a cottage is almost deserted .
neighbouring cottages that used to belong to local families , have steadily become holiday homes .
the influx of cash from outside the area has pushed prices out of the league of local people , such as neal .
even renting is a struggle .
the tiny two-up , two-down cottage they 're leasing now costs nearly £ 500 a month .
bus stops full details of the election bus tour " we 're just getting shoved out , " he said .
with rents so high , neal and hayley have struggled to save .
without a deposit , the banks are reluctant to offer a mortgage .
the most they could possibly borrow would be about £ 110,000 which , thanks to outside buyers , is no longer enough .
tristan bannister , of local estate agent scammell adamson , says appledore is an acute example of a widespread problem .
" there are certain streets you can go along and knock on every door and only two people will answer , " he told us .
" they 're just not lived in . "
slow death he 's currently handling a two-bedroom cottage a few doors down from neal 's rented cottage .
the estate agent 's description opens by calling it : " an ideal opportunity to acquire a second home or holiday home investment . "
it would suit neal and hayley perfectly - if it were n't £ 175,000 .
about eight years ago , before the influx , it would have been about £ 50,000 .
neal 's inability to buy may impact on his lifeboat volunteering " we 'd all love local people to buy everywhere , " said tristan .
" but as soon as it comes to selling , we all want to get the most money , whether the buyer 's from middlesex or wherever . "
this slow death of devon 's villages is causing acute local concern .
ella maunder grew up in the village of meshaw .
when she was a child , it was a thriving farming community with a pub , post office and village shop .
now they 've all closed , she said .
" the farms do n't go to farmers , " she said .
" they go to people who want a country abode .
the coastal villages especially are ghost towns . "
a whole generation of young people , would-be first time buyers , are forced to rent - or relocate - because they have been priced out of the market altogether .
the bbc news website went to bideford , devon to speak to people about affordable housing .
in pictures andrew fiske , the housing manager for south hams council in south devon , says house prices in his district have risen by about 200 % in the last seven years , making it impossible for young couples to get on the property ladder .
as a result , south hams alone has about 100 homeless households .
some families have now been in temporary bed-and-breakfast accommodation for more than two years .
lifeboat role the council is seen as one of the region 's most progressive .
last year it found the finances to plan 130 affordable new homes , a steep rise from the usual total of between 20 and 25 .
about 70 of these properties will be for rent , targeting the homeless and those in acute need .
the rest will be available for shared ownership , making it possible for local people to buy a stake - say 25 % of the cost price - and rent the rest .
have your say the quality of life people associated with living in the country has gone andy d , oxford , uk send your comments former council properties are now only sold to people who have lived and worked in devon for at least three years .
but despite these innovative measures , it seems almost impossible to keep pace with demand .
regional breakdown 2004 percentage of income spent on mortgage payments north east of england : 13.1 % north west of england : 15.8 % yorkshire : 16.6 % east midlands : 17.4 % west midlands : 18.3 % east of england : 21.6 % london : 22.8 % south east of england : 22.2 % south west of england : 23.3 % england : 20.4 % wales : 17.2 % scotland : 13.7 % northern ireland : 14.2 % source : shelter " at the moment , we 're just keeping our heads above water , " said andrew fiske .
" if we are going to build less affordable homes , we start to go under . "
in the meantime , neal and hayley are pleased to have found even a rental property .
they came within a few days , neal told us , of being forced to leave their last rented home with nowhere else to go .
his house hunt is complicated by the fact he volunteers with the local lifeboat station .
that commitment requires him to live within a three-mile radius .
if the housing market does not change dramatically , he said , he might be forced to quit .
in the meantime , he and hayley are starting life together in a street of silent , shuttered houses .
" we never used to need streetlights here , " he told me , wistfully .
" everyone used to have their living room lights on .
but now , they 're all off . "

the city has been pressing for a bypass to ease traffic congestion .
supporters of the scheme say it will boost the local economy , relieve congestion and improve safety .
objectors believe it will destroy the green belt , and on the preferred route , cut through a community for special needs adults and children at camphill .
since the public consultation period began last month , more than 4,000 people have visited exhibitions detailing the five possible routes and thousands more have submitted responses .
traffic congestion if the preferred route is chosen it will cost up to £ 280m and could be the subject of a public inquiry before being completed by 2010 .
transport minister nicol stephen said a decision would be taken after responses had been examined .
he said the new road would significantly reduce traffic congestion and boost the local economy .
the camphill community is for people with learning difficulties .
their properties at myrtle would end up on either side of the proposed new road .
the organisation was founded in aberdeen almost 70 years ago and has grown into an international movement dedicated to helping adults and children with special needs .
there are more than 90 camphill communities in 21 countries , including 47 in the uk and ireland .
protestors claim the deeside community will be destroyed by the road .
they fear that constant traffic noise could disrupt work at the camphill rudolph steiner school with children suffering from severe behavioural problems .
however , a scottish executive study suggested the project could be driven through the camphill development without damaging the school residents could even be moved during construction , it suggested .

the city has been pressing for a bypass to ease traffic congestion .
supporters of the scheme say it will boost the local economy , relieve congestion and improve safety .
objectors believe it will destroy the green belt , and on the preferred route , cut through a community for special needs adults and children at camphill .
since the public consultation period began last month , more than 4,000 people have visited exhibitions detailing the five possible routes and thousands more have submitted responses .
traffic congestion if the preferred route is chosen it will cost up to £ 280m and could be the subject of a public inquiry before being completed by 2010 .
transport minister nicol stephen said a decision would be taken after responses had been examined .
he said the new road would significantly reduce traffic congestion and boost the local economy .

their properties at myrtle would end up on either side of the proposed new road .
the organisation was founded in aberdeen almost 70 years ago and has grown into an international movement dedicated to helping adults and children with special needs .
there are more than 90 camphill communities in 21 countries , including 47 in the uk and ireland .

biometric fingerprint sensors are being trialled at a newcastle nightclub in an effort to sift out under-18 revellers .
the equipment has been designed by a gateshead company , whose hi-tech gadgets have already featured in the hollywood blockbuster i robot .
police and leisure bosses are backing the revolutionary project .
biometric technology is already being used to combat terrorism at airports .
but gateshead-based uk biometrics claims it could become a major tool in combating under-age drinking and associated anti-social behaviour .
northumbria police and pubs and club chain ultimate leisure are supporting a pilot scheme , which has seen fingerprint sensors installed at newcastle blu-bambu nightclub .
patented idea uk biometrics managing director matt james said : " we can now get rid of people having to bring along identification to prove their age and identity if they want to get into a nightclub , or any other premises .
" people just have to register with the system once by proving who they are , and that 's that .
" it is something that is there to protect the licence as well as people who go out on the town . "
the company says it has patented the idea and hopes it will be taken up by the leisure industry .
bob senior , chief executive of ultimate leisure said : " we find that counterfeit ids are so good now that it makes it very difficult to spot the difference with the real thing .
" the great thing about the biometric system is it means that we as licensees can protect ourselves from the risks of accidentally allowing under-age drinkers in . "
mr james added : " fingerprint sensors are nothing new , but we are looking at how this technology can be incorporated into today 's world . "
mr james said the technology was also being tipped to be used at atm machines and schools .
the system is due to be exhibited at a security industry exhibition at birmingham 's nec in may .

both sides agreed a deal after a judge upheld lee 's demand for 10 % of marvel 's profits from the spider-man films .
spider-man and its sequel made $ 1.6bn -lrb- £ 857m -rrb- at box offices worldwide .
the undisclosed deal could be worth tens of millions of dollars to mr lee .
his lawyer howard graff said : " we are very , very happy with the resolution . "
the agreement , signed on 22 april and made public on thursday , cemented lee 's future relationship with marvel , he said .
appeal dropped mr lee 's " friendly neighbourhood spider-man " had turned out to be quite a friend , said graff .
after the court ruled in mr lee 's favour in january , marvel had said it would appeal .
but the company 's lawyer john turitzin said the company was now happy to have resolved the dispute with mr lee , 82 , who he called " one of the founders of today 's comic book industry " .
mr lee began legal action in 2002 , saying marvel shut him out of " jackpot " profits from the first blockbuster film .
he said the company - where he worked for more than 60 years - had gone back on an agreement to give him the 10 % .
the spider-man films are among the top box office hits of all time mr lee maintained he should be entitled to a slice of profits from dvd sales and certain merchandise , a claim backed by the court in new york .
in january , us district court judge robert w sweet ruled that mr lee should get a tenth of profits generated since november 1998 by marvel tv and movie productions involving the company 's characters .

my daughter has a new laptop .
she needs one for school , especially since she will be starting her gcse coursework in september .
and i am tired of being kicked off my main desktop machine so she can check her e-mail , chat to her friends or compose frighteningly eloquent letters complaining about the iniquities of her school 's plan to install unisex toilets .
coincidentally , her laptop arrived just as i was reading a newly-published book about the early days of computing .
electronic brains grew out of a radio series produced by its author , mike hally , and is an excellent introduction to the men and women whose work laid the foundations of the computing revolution .
looking at lili 's sleek new computer i could not help reflect on how far we have come .
there are now five computers in our house and we probably have the processing capacity of the entire continental united states from 1955 at our disposal .
my family may be part of the digital elite , but the latest report from the esociety team at the london school of economics makes it clear that too many families in the uk are seriously disadvantaged when it comes to computer use and internet access .
while the digital divide between rich and poor worlds is far more severe and needs to be addressed , we can not ignore the divisions within our own country if you fight your way through the usual headline-grabbing claims that parents want stronger laws to clamp down on online pornography , the ' uk children go online ' report provides clear evidence of the digital divide between the children of parents who are confident net users and those who are unable to offer their children support or guidance .
net illiterate ' failing children ' just as children of professional parents get more help with schoolwork , have more books at home , watch less tv and - in many cases - have a privileged private education to ensure that they are pushed through exams and on to university , so the children of poorer , working class families are less likely to have computers or net access at home .
even when they do their parents are not able to act as guides and teachers or encourage the sophisticated use of network tools like search engines .
the result is a growing split between those who " get " the net and those for whom it is a poorly-exploited resource .
since many schools now set homework and course work on the assumption that students have net access at home , those on the wrong side of the fence are left at a serious disadvantage .
the findings are hardly surprising , but it is useful to have a clear statement of the scale of the problem to present to politicians and policy-makers .
and while the digital divide between rich and poor worlds is far more severe and needs to be addressed , we can not ignore the divisions within our own country .
education and awareness are part of the solution , and it is reassuring to see that media regulator ofcom sees web skills as part of the wider area of " media literacy " which it is trying to promote .
home net use : a privilege or a right ?
i have worked for many years with the bbc 's own webwise campaign , and it too can make a difference .
we can not leave it to the market to encourage a critical approach to internet use because , just as with television , the content providers would prefer us not to look too closely at what they are offering or to be aware of the alternatives .
google wants us to stick with google , just as yahoo ! or msn or ask jeeves want their existing users to stick with them - an educated marketplace is an unpredictable one .
but we need more than education : we need to get poorer families online in the first place , so that they have an internet connection to learn about .
access from public libraries or school is not going to be enough .
our children need to be able to hook up to the net from home , any time they want .
perhaps television can come to the rescue .
sometime in the next seven years the uk is going to move from analogue to digital transmission for all television and radio .
the government has just set up switchco to make sure it all goes smoothly .
when it happens everyone who wants to watch tv will need a home computer .
it wo n't actually look like a computer , as it will be hidden inside a digital set-top box or even built into the tv , but that 's what it will be .
everyone with freeview or sky + or cable has one already .
eventually switchco is going to have to give everyone who has not already switched to digital a free set top box .
they are denying this at the moment , as admitting it would stop people going out and buying the boxes themselves , but it is pretty obvious that it will happen .
specialised the computers in today 's set top boxes are specialised , attached to low-resolution tv screens which are no good for close-up activities like e-mailing or browsing the web .
but the price of hardware is falling dramatically .
the ceo of chip maker amd , hector ruis , has said that he sees a $ 100 laptop as a real possibility in three years or so .
nicholas negroponte , founder of the mit media lab , has also launched a campaign for a $ 100 computer for less developed countries .
suppose that instead of giving people a set top box we gave them a real computer , with a socket for a tv signal and a socket for a monitor ?
suppose that it came with a screen , keyboard and mouse , and had wireless networking built in ?
we 'd have a wired britain overnight , especially if the work of the community broadband network was given more support in providing low-cost net access for all .
this is something we have to take seriously as a society , and it would be a great task for an incoming government of whatever party .

home net use : a privilege or a right ?
i have worked for many years with the bbc 's own webwise campaign , and it too can make a difference .
we can not leave it to the market to encourage a critical approach to internet use because , just as with television , the content providers would prefer us not to look too closely at what they are offering or to be aware of the alternatives .
google wants us to stick with google , just as yahoo ! or msn or ask jeeves want their existing users to stick with them - an educated marketplace is an unpredictable one .
but we need more than education : we need to get poorer families online in the first place , so that they have an internet connection to learn about .
access from public libraries or school is not going to be enough .
our children need to be able to hook up to the net from home , any time they want .
perhaps television can come to the rescue .
sometime in the next seven years the uk is going to move from analogue to digital transmission for all television and radio .
the government has just set up switchco to make sure it all goes smoothly .
when it happens everyone who wants to watch tv will need a home computer .
it wo n't actually look like a computer , as it will be hidden inside a digital set-top box or even built into the tv , but that 's what it will be .
everyone with freeview or sky + or cable has one already .
eventually switchco is going to have to give everyone who has not already switched to digital a free set top box .
they are denying this at the moment , as admitting it would stop people going out and buying the boxes themselves , but it is pretty obvious that it will happen .
specialised the computers in today 's set top boxes are specialised , attached to low-resolution tv screens which are no good for close-up activities like e-mailing or browsing the web .
but the price of hardware is falling dramatically .
the ceo of chip maker amd , hector ruis , has said that he sees a $ 100 laptop as a real possibility in three years or so .
nicholas negroponte , founder of the mit media lab , has also launched a campaign for a $ 100 computer for less developed countries .
suppose that instead of giving people a set top box we gave them a real computer , with a socket for a tv signal and a socket for a monitor ?
suppose that it came with a screen , keyboard and mouse , and had wireless networking built in ?
we 'd have a wired britain overnight , especially if the work of the community broadband network was given more support in providing low-cost net access for all .
this is something we have to take seriously as a society , and it would be a great task for an incoming government of whatever party .

my daughter has a new laptop .
she needs one for school , especially since she will be starting her gcse coursework in september .
and i am tired of being kicked off my main desktop machine so she can check her e-mail , chat to her friends or compose frighteningly eloquent letters complaining about the iniquities of her school 's plan to install unisex toilets .
coincidentally , her laptop arrived just as i was reading a newly-published book about the early days of computing .
electronic brains grew out of a radio series produced by its author , mike hally , and is an excellent introduction to the men and women whose work laid the foundations of the computing revolution .
looking at lili 's sleek new computer i could not help reflect on how far we have come .
there are now five computers in our house and we probably have the processing capacity of the entire continental united states from 1955 at our disposal .
my family may be part of the digital elite , but the latest report from the esociety team at the london school of economics makes it clear that too many families in the uk are seriously disadvantaged when it comes to computer use and internet access .
while the digital divide between rich and poor worlds is far more severe and needs to be addressed , we can not ignore the divisions within our own country if you fight your way through the usual headline-grabbing claims that parents want stronger laws to clamp down on online pornography , the ' uk children go online ' report provides clear evidence of the digital divide between the children of parents who are confident net users and those who are unable to offer their children support or guidance .
net illiterate ' failing children ' just as children of professional parents get more help with schoolwork , have more books at home , watch less tv and - in many cases - have a privileged private education to ensure that they are pushed through exams and on to university , so the children of poorer , working class families are less likely to have computers or net access at home .
even when they do their parents are not able to act as guides and teachers or encourage the sophisticated use of network tools like search engines .
the result is a growing split between those who " get " the net and those for whom it is a poorly-exploited resource .
since many schools now set homework and course work on the assumption that students have net access at home , those on the wrong side of the fence are left at a serious disadvantage .
the findings are hardly surprising , but it is useful to have a clear statement of the scale of the problem to present to politicians and policy-makers .

my daughter has a new laptop .
she needs one for school , especially since she will be starting her gcse coursework in september .
and i am tired of being kicked off my main desktop machine so she can check her e-mail , chat to her friends or compose frighteningly eloquent letters complaining about the iniquities of her school 's plan to install unisex toilets .
coincidentally , her laptop arrived just as i was reading a newly-published book about the early days of computing .
electronic brains grew out of a radio series produced by its author , mike hally , and is an excellent introduction to the men and women whose work laid the foundations of the computing revolution .
looking at lili 's sleek new computer i could not help reflect on how far we have come .
there are now five computers in our house and we probably have the processing capacity of the entire continental united states from 1955 at our disposal .
my family may be part of the digital elite , but the latest report from the esociety team at the london school of economics makes it clear that too many families in the uk are seriously disadvantaged when it comes to computer use and internet access .
while the digital divide between rich and poor worlds is far more severe and needs to be addressed , we can not ignore the divisions within our own country if you fight your way through the usual headline-grabbing claims that parents want stronger laws to clamp down on online pornography , the ' uk children go online ' report provides clear evidence of the digital divide between the children of parents who are confident net users and those who are unable to offer their children support or guidance .
net illiterate ' failing children ' just as children of professional parents get more help with schoolwork , have more books at home , watch less tv and - in many cases - have a privileged private education to ensure that they are pushed through exams and on to university , so the children of poorer , working class families are less likely to have computers or net access at home .
even when they do their parents are not able to act as guides and teachers or encourage the sophisticated use of network tools like search engines .
the result is a growing split between those who " get " the net and those for whom it is a poorly-exploited resource .
since many schools now set homework and course work on the assumption that students have net access at home , those on the wrong side of the fence are left at a serious disadvantage .
the findings are hardly surprising , but it is useful to have a clear statement of the scale of the problem to present to politicians and policy-makers .
and while the digital divide between rich and poor worlds is far more severe and needs to be addressed , we can not ignore the divisions within our own country .
education and awareness are part of the solution , and it is reassuring to see that media regulator ofcom sees web skills as part of the wider area of " media literacy " which it is trying to promote .
home net use : a privilege or a right ?
i have worked for many years with the bbc 's own webwise campaign , and it too can make a difference .
we can not leave it to the market to encourage a critical approach to internet use because , just as with television , the content providers would prefer us not to look too closely at what they are offering or to be aware of the alternatives .
google wants us to stick with google , just as yahoo ! or msn or ask jeeves want their existing users to stick with them - an educated marketplace is an unpredictable one .
but we need more than education : we need to get poorer families online in the first place , so that they have an internet connection to learn about .
access from public libraries or school is not going to be enough .
our children need to be able to hook up to the net from home , any time they want .
perhaps television can come to the rescue .
sometime in the next seven years the uk is going to move from analogue to digital transmission for all television and radio .
the government has just set up switchco to make sure it all goes smoothly .
when it happens everyone who wants to watch tv will need a home computer .
it wo n't actually look like a computer , as it will be hidden inside a digital set-top box or even built into the tv , but that 's what it will be .
everyone with freeview or sky + or cable has one already .
eventually switchco is going to have to give everyone who has not already switched to digital a free set top box .
they are denying this at the moment , as admitting it would stop people going out and buying the boxes themselves , but it is pretty obvious that it will happen .
specialised the computers in today 's set top boxes are specialised , attached to low-resolution tv screens which are no good for close-up activities like e-mailing or browsing the web .
but the price of hardware is falling dramatically .
the ceo of chip maker amd , hector ruis , has said that he sees a $ 100 laptop as a real possibility in three years or so .
nicholas negroponte , founder of the mit media lab , has also launched a campaign for a $ 100 computer for less developed countries .
suppose that instead of giving people a set top box we gave them a real computer , with a socket for a tv signal and a socket for a monitor ?
suppose that it came with a screen , keyboard and mouse , and had wireless networking built in ?
we 'd have a wired britain overnight , especially if the work of the community broadband network was given more support in providing low-cost net access for all .
this is something we have to take seriously as a society , and it would be a great task for an incoming government of whatever party .
