john carrafiell , head of european real estate at investment bankers morgan stanley told reporters that the boom in german property was the investment opportunity du jour during a speech at the annual mipim property trade fair in cannes on wednesday .
carrafiell 's comments echoed a recent report by the royal institute of chartered surveyors which described the german housing market as a " long-term stagnant market which appears to be picking up as owner-occupiers increase their mortgage demands . "
the report also found some regional differences , with east germany still afflicted by oversupply of housing , whilst house prices in cities like munich and frankfurt have seen moderate growth . dw-world.de steven seagal is hard to prosecute three years after action-movie star steven seagal and crew stayed in her villa , a berlin landlady is still fighting the martial arts expert in the german courts over the damage he allegedly inflicted on her property .

a spokesperson for the ministry of justice confirmed that there are " two possibilities in discussion at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making a go of it alone is not without trials here the former plan has the greater potential for meeting with resistance and sparking debate .
on the one hand there are the corporate law experts who are favor of relaxing the financial conditions for germans considering going it alone , citing great britain and france as examples of countries where entrepreneurs do n't need any of their own capital . traditional tough line but that view is shunned by traditionalists , who believe that one way to reduce the annual number of liquidations in germany is to make start-up conditions tougher than they are now .
their belief is that the more money business novices bring with them into their new working lives , the greater the likelihood they will succeed . the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- is also in favour of raising the level of entry cash .
but in reality , the current economic climate in germany could make such measures a step in the wrong direction . a report commissioned by the kfw bank group , and published this week , revealed that although last year witnessed an increase in the number of people setting up on their own as a way out of financially desperate times , the number of those seizing the opportunity to fill genuine holes in the market had dropped significantly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ich ags are still popular with the unemployed thus , the increase can be largely attributed to those on government-funded self-starter programs .
sixteen percent of these state-backed business ventures for the unemployed , known as ich ags or " me , incorporated , " were registered in 2004 . back to work frank wallau of germany 's institute for small and medium-sized enterprises is a great believer the concept of self-employment as a way of helping the jobless back into the labor market . " ich ags have become an instrument to get people working again , and that is a good thing , " he said .
" to what extent they are viable ideas which survive , however , remains to be seen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : super chef jamie oliver is one example of a british success story the cologne-based research group which carried out the survey examined the current start-up climate in germany , and compared it with that in thirty other countries .
they found that in spite of the overall growth in the number of new companies , of all the countries included in the survey , germans were the most pessimistic about staying afloat as their own boss . only 13 percent of those asked expressed a belief that they could succeed , compared with 38 and 34 percent in the netherlands and the united states respectively . no second chance frank wallau believes the negative attitude towards self-employment is related to the lack of a second-chance culture in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more flexibility required from german banks " in some countries , there 's an attitude which allows you to fail once and try again , and then if you fail twice , it 's a case of third time lucky .
that is not the way it works here .
if your business fails , it is very difficult to get a second chance , " said wallau . but he believes there will be a shift " once people start to see restarters as an economic phenomenon and conditions improve .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .

and that wo n't change any time soon .

across the continent , governments are wondering if wolfowitz has the right credentials for the position .
but they 're well aware how much is at stake . " i doubt the europeans will be able to block it as george w. bush probably cleared it among european leaders : tony blair and possibly even jacques chirac , " fraser cameron , director of studies at the european policy center in brussels , told afp . " the issue appears to be a done deal , " agreed jerome sgard , a senior economist at the center for prospective studies and international information -lrb- ceepi -rrb- in paris .
" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .
" with wolfowitz , we ca n't really say that he is incompetent .
it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .
" it would risk reopening a highly visible conflict where once again we would have europeans opposing the americans on a decision that in principle is theirs to make . " through an informal agreement between the founding member states of the two bodies , the united states traditionally nominates the world bank president and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " it 's a negative decision , but not a surprising one , " said rafael villacis of san pablo university in madrid , adding that putting wolfowitz at the head of the world bank would empty the institution of its " social aspect " . but haine countered with a positive way for europe to view the nomination . " the white house is getting rid of the most virulent neo-conservatives like john bolton and paul wolfowitz by placing them at international institutions - meaning they are no longer in charge of american policy , " he said . enthusiasm in germany limited in germany , michael müller , the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , described the choice as " horrifying . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " wolfowitz is a hawk who has repeatedly proved that he is a firebrand , " he went on .
according to müller , wolfowitz 's appointment would put the world economy at risk of being taken over by a military mind-set of repression and supremacy . " our enthusiasm in ' old ' europe is limited , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . threat to trans-atlantic consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james d. wolfensohn current world bank president james wolfensohn -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down this summer . analysts had said wednesday that bush 's nomination of wolfowitz threatened to put that transatlantic consensus to the test . aside from iraq , wolfowitz has attracted criticism from many as a leading light of the neo-conservative movement , which wants the us to impose its vision of liberal democracy and free-market economics on others . according to reuters , staff at the world bank itself are concerned that his links to the iraq war could undermine the bank 's credibility . but the 61-year-old former academic sought to win over his detractors by declaring that he believed " deeply and passionately in the mission of the world bank . " " the opportunity of working to lift a billion people who earn less than a dollar a day out of poverty and billions of others who live in circumstances of poverty , to give them a chance in life , is an exciting responsibility and a real challenge , " he said . as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . but the institution has also been accused of backing grandiose development projects which have little economic worth and of fostering poverty by driving nations deeper into debt . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of german-us relations with president george w. bush heading for germany wednesday , united states expert knud krakau analyzed the state of relations between the two countries in an interview with dw-world .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .
and not even the supporters of the basic income model can say for sure whether there would be enough political will to see through such a change . monika hogen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

john carrafiell , head of european real estate at investment bankers morgan stanley told reporters that the boom in german property was the investment opportunity du jour during a speech at the annual mipim property trade fair in cannes on wednesday .
carrafiell 's comments echoed a recent report by the royal institute of chartered surveyors which described the german housing market as a " long-term stagnant market which appears to be picking up as owner-occupiers increase their mortgage demands . "
the report also found some regional differences , with east germany still afflicted by oversupply of housing , whilst house prices in cities like munich and frankfurt have seen moderate growth . dw-world.de steven seagal is hard to prosecute three years after action-movie star steven seagal and crew stayed in her villa , a berlin landlady is still fighting the martial arts expert in the german courts over the damage he allegedly inflicted on her property .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .

john carrafiell , head of european real estate at investment bankers morgan stanley told reporters that the boom in german property was the investment opportunity du jour during a speech at the annual mipim property trade fair in cannes on wednesday .
carrafiell 's comments echoed a recent report by the royal institute of chartered surveyors which described the german housing market as a " long-term stagnant market which appears to be picking up as owner-occupiers increase their mortgage demands . "
the report also found some regional differences , with east germany still afflicted by oversupply of housing , whilst house prices in cities like munich and frankfurt have seen moderate growth . dw-world.de steven seagal is hard to prosecute three years after action-movie star steven seagal and crew stayed in her villa , a berlin landlady is still fighting the martial arts expert in the german courts over the damage he allegedly inflicted on her property .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .
the relationship , though very friendly , is anything but normal , say experts .
and that wo n't change any time soon .

europe 's referees say enough is enough and are considering striking . for a period of two weeks , referee anders frisk 's life and that of his family was a living hell . death threats , in the form of phone calls and letters , arrived at his home in sweden on a daily basis .
fans of the london soccer club chelsea , angry at him for awarding a red card to one of their players in a champion 's league match against fc barcelona , would n't let up .
" those were the worst 16 days of my career , " said frisk upon stepping down .
" i would n't let my daughter open the mailbox anymore , out of fear . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after dimissing chelsea striker didier drogba -lrb- l . -rrb- with a yellow-red card in this champion 's league match in barcelona , fc barcelona used the man-advantage to turn the game and win 2-1 . roughly a year before germany gets ready to host the world cup , european soccer 's governing body uefa is without one of their top referees and facing increasing criticism that not enough is being done to protect them .
a spokesman for uefa said this week that the organization is trying to convince frisk to stay on board . frisk often the victim referee representatives say the climate is such that coaches and fans seem to think they can criticize at will . swiss ref urs meier had suffered a deluge of threats from england fans after making a controversial call against the english side in the european soccer championships last june . a paper had published his home address and phone number .
frisk was hit in the head by a flying object during a champion 's league match he refereed in september between as rome and dynamo kiev in rome .
uefa officials immediately called off the match and awarded the win to kiev .
a few months later , fans threw objects at him as he refereed a game between werder bremen and fc valencia . " his resignation is the result of the irresponsibility on the part of managers , " said volker roth , head of the german and european referees .
" they encourage the fans with their behavior .
i imagine frisk wo n't be the last to say , ' i wo n't allow myself and my family to go through that . ' " chelsea coach blamed roth took special aim at jose mourinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , chelsea 's flamboyant and controversial coach .
following the match , mourinho raised uefa 's ire by alleging that frisk consulted with fc barcelona coach frank rijkaard during halftime of the match .
the accusations were later proved to be unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose mourinho 's chelsea is leading atop the english league standings and is a favorite to win the champion 's league .
" people like mourinho are the enemy of soccer , " roth told the swedish daily aftonbladet .
he has refused to apologize for the remarks and appeared nonplussed at mourinho 's announcement that he planned to file a complaint against roth . roth appears to be getting support from other corners .
the president of the world soccer body fifa told reporters that " those who attack referees , attack soccer . " considering a strike germany 's own referee community has shown solidarity with the swede .
they have criticized the fact that refs are n't allowed at postgame press conferences to reply to coach criticism and the endless replay of controversial calls on television . " the question is whether you have to show every controversial episode over and over again in video replay , like we do in germany , and then mercilessly criticize my colleagues , " said referee eugen strigel in a newspaper interview .
" to ref a match mistake-free is impossible . " though europe 's referees have not yet threatened to go on strike , roth said it was a " legal means " to express frustration with the state of affairs .

her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .
the relationship , though very friendly , is anything but normal , say experts .
and that wo n't change any time soon .

in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .

i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .
and not even the supporters of the basic income model can say for sure whether there would be enough political will to see through such a change . monika hogen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .

not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2005 europe ponders wolfowitz nomination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " architect of the iraq war , " wolfowitz is n't popular in germany most european states will accept bush 's nomination of paul wolfowitz as world bank chief , as a veto would reverse the thaw in transatlantic relations , analysts said thursday . a day after bush put forward his arch-conservative deputy defense secretary as world bank chief , europe is still mulling the controversial choice .
across the continent , governments are wondering if wolfowitz has the right credentials for the position .
but they 're well aware how much is at stake . " i doubt the europeans will be able to block it as george w. bush probably cleared it among european leaders : tony blair and possibly even jacques chirac , " fraser cameron , director of studies at the european policy center in brussels , told afp . " the issue appears to be a done deal , " agreed jerome sgard , a senior economist at the center for prospective studies and international information -lrb- ceepi -rrb- in paris .
" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .
" with wolfowitz , we ca n't really say that he is incompetent .
it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .
" it would risk reopening a highly visible conflict where once again we would have europeans opposing the americans on a decision that in principle is theirs to make . " through an informal agreement between the founding member states of the two bodies , the united states traditionally nominates the world bank president and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " it 's a negative decision , but not a surprising one , " said rafael villacis of san pablo university in madrid , adding that putting wolfowitz at the head of the world bank would empty the institution of its " social aspect " . but haine countered with a positive way for europe to view the nomination . " the white house is getting rid of the most virulent neo-conservatives like john bolton and paul wolfowitz by placing them at international institutions - meaning they are no longer in charge of american policy , " he said . enthusiasm in germany limited in germany , michael müller , the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , described the choice as " horrifying . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " wolfowitz is a hawk who has repeatedly proved that he is a firebrand , " he went on .
according to müller , wolfowitz 's appointment would put the world economy at risk of being taken over by a military mind-set of repression and supremacy . " our enthusiasm in ' old ' europe is limited , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . threat to trans-atlantic consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james d. wolfensohn current world bank president james wolfensohn -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down this summer . analysts had said wednesday that bush 's nomination of wolfowitz threatened to put that transatlantic consensus to the test . aside from iraq , wolfowitz has attracted criticism from many as a leading light of the neo-conservative movement , which wants the us to impose its vision of liberal democracy and free-market economics on others . according to reuters , staff at the world bank itself are concerned that his links to the iraq war could undermine the bank 's credibility . but the 61-year-old former academic sought to win over his detractors by declaring that he believed " deeply and passionately in the mission of the world bank . " " the opportunity of working to lift a billion people who earn less than a dollar a day out of poverty and billions of others who live in circumstances of poverty , to give them a chance in life , is an exciting responsibility and a real challenge , " he said . as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . but the institution has also been accused of backing grandiose development projects which have little economic worth and of fostering poverty by driving nations deeper into debt . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of german-us relations with president george w. bush heading for germany wednesday , united states expert knud krakau analyzed the state of relations between the two countries in an interview with dw-world .

" it 's a negative decision , but not a surprising one , " said rafael villacis of san pablo university in madrid , adding that putting wolfowitz at the head of the world bank would empty the institution of its " social aspect " . but haine countered with a positive way for europe to view the nomination . " the white house is getting rid of the most virulent neo-conservatives like john bolton and paul wolfowitz by placing them at international institutions - meaning they are no longer in charge of american policy , " he said . enthusiasm in germany limited in germany , michael müller , the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , described the choice as " horrifying .

" " the opportunity of working to lift a billion people who earn less than a dollar a day out of poverty and billions of others who live in circumstances of poverty , to give them a chance in life , is an exciting responsibility and a real challenge , " he said . as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . but the institution has also been accused of backing grandiose development projects which have little economic worth and of fostering poverty by driving nations deeper into debt . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of german-us relations with president george w. bush heading for germany wednesday , united states expert knud krakau analyzed the state of relations between the two countries in an interview with dw-world .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live euromaxx - leben und kultur in europa we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .

so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2005 oh lord , what freaks ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock n ' roll religion europe is in the clutch of a new religious craze .
known as the " jesus freaks , " these pious , fundamentalist christians are giving the established church a run for its money . they do n't take drugs , do n't believe in sex before marriage and slam homosexuality as a disease , but for all that , the jesus freaks distance themselves from the idea of political conservatism .
rather than running around bashing their bibles , they are more likely to be found banging their heads to the din of trash metal . it all began back in 1991 in a bedroom in the city of hamburg .
three spiritual souls came clean and admitted their shared wish to make jesus a part of their lives .
united in their belief that their saviour rose from the dead 2,000 years ago and is still alive today , they made it their mission to activate him in their lives .
it was the first time they had felt free enough to drop their guard and began to pray . bildunterschrift : rejoicing in the freedom of freaky christianity " in front of god , we were able to be ourselves and we wanted everything he had to give us .
most people who joined our meetings later , came because they believed in jesus but had struggled to be accepted as they are , " the freaks say on their web site . real freaks or just colorful christians ? they go on to explain that despite crucifixion , witch burning , boring church sermons and pseudo-religious fuss , they believe there is something intrinsically real and fascinating about jesus .
at first glance , their statements read a little like the words of quirky jesus disciples , but on closer inspection , it 's clear that they are serious about christian work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life the jesus way ?
tobi kaiser is one of around 2,500 german freaks and head of the north rhine-westphalian branch of the movement .
the 31-year-old , a lay vicar in cologne , is absolutely dedicated to his life as a freak and believes their way of doing things is the perfect replacement for the dry nature of the official church .
he credo is to " live his whole life the jesus way . " in place of the usual liturgical fare of traditional sermons , the jesus freaks in cologne offer their congregation an altogether different approach .
tobi says they have their " own language , their own music , and the whole thing in a cosy living room environment . "
they meet in a former bar , where they can walk about , dance or just hang out on the sofa , drinking the beer that they are free to bring along . out with the staid , in with the new crusade " the jesus freaks fill the spiritual vacuum left open by the official church , " says klaus farin , who runs the berlin archive for youth culture and has written a book about the group .
his analysis led him to the conclusion that " lively events are much more successful than the sometimes slowcoach church approach to youth work . " bildunterschrift : singing the gospel whether through trash metal concerts or river christening ceremonies , the jesus freaks know how to help youngsters who are struggling to find their religious center .
it 's a sigh of hallelujah for those concerned , but the protestant church feels the throb of having its nose knocked out of joint . " there are differences of opinion in the practice of christening ceremonies and with regard to questions of style , " said reinhard hempelmann of the protestant center of ideology .
but he does say that the work of the freaks , when it comes to the meaning of the christian faith , is " commendable . " so does that mean it is time for a new ecumenical movement ?
perhaps on the outside , that is what has already begun to grow , but in terms of the content being preached , the gulf between the traditional church-goers and the freaks is not as wide as it might initially seem . marcus bösch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?
the decision to award a catholic radio station one of munich 's coveted fm frequencies has caused outcry among critics who say the programming is too fundamentalist .

her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2005 oh lord , what freaks ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock n ' roll religion europe is in the clutch of a new religious craze .
known as the " jesus freaks , " these pious , fundamentalist christians are giving the established church a run for its money . they do n't take drugs , do n't believe in sex before marriage and slam homosexuality as a disease , but for all that , the jesus freaks distance themselves from the idea of political conservatism .
rather than running around bashing their bibles , they are more likely to be found banging their heads to the din of trash metal . it all began back in 1991 in a bedroom in the city of hamburg .
three spiritual souls came clean and admitted their shared wish to make jesus a part of their lives .
united in their belief that their saviour rose from the dead 2,000 years ago and is still alive today , they made it their mission to activate him in their lives .
it was the first time they had felt free enough to drop their guard and began to pray . bildunterschrift : rejoicing in the freedom of freaky christianity " in front of god , we were able to be ourselves and we wanted everything he had to give us .
most people who joined our meetings later , came because they believed in jesus but had struggled to be accepted as they are , " the freaks say on their web site . real freaks or just colorful christians ? they go on to explain that despite crucifixion , witch burning , boring church sermons and pseudo-religious fuss , they believe there is something intrinsically real and fascinating about jesus .
at first glance , their statements read a little like the words of quirky jesus disciples , but on closer inspection , it 's clear that they are serious about christian work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life the jesus way ?
tobi kaiser is one of around 2,500 german freaks and head of the north rhine-westphalian branch of the movement .
the 31-year-old , a lay vicar in cologne , is absolutely dedicated to his life as a freak and believes their way of doing things is the perfect replacement for the dry nature of the official church .
he credo is to " live his whole life the jesus way . " in place of the usual liturgical fare of traditional sermons , the jesus freaks in cologne offer their congregation an altogether different approach .
tobi says they have their " own language , their own music , and the whole thing in a cosy living room environment . "
they meet in a former bar , where they can walk about , dance or just hang out on the sofa , drinking the beer that they are free to bring along . out with the staid , in with the new crusade " the jesus freaks fill the spiritual vacuum left open by the official church , " says klaus farin , who runs the berlin archive for youth culture and has written a book about the group .
his analysis led him to the conclusion that " lively events are much more successful than the sometimes slowcoach church approach to youth work . " bildunterschrift : singing the gospel whether through trash metal concerts or river christening ceremonies , the jesus freaks know how to help youngsters who are struggling to find their religious center .
it 's a sigh of hallelujah for those concerned , but the protestant church feels the throb of having its nose knocked out of joint . " there are differences of opinion in the practice of christening ceremonies and with regard to questions of style , " said reinhard hempelmann of the protestant center of ideology .
but he does say that the work of the freaks , when it comes to the meaning of the christian faith , is " commendable . " so does that mean it is time for a new ecumenical movement ?
perhaps on the outside , that is what has already begun to grow , but in terms of the content being preached , the gulf between the traditional church-goers and the freaks is not as wide as it might initially seem . marcus bösch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?
the decision to award a catholic radio station one of munich 's coveted fm frequencies has caused outcry among critics who say the programming is too fundamentalist .

jessica may have been one of germany 's " invisible children , " but there are many other cases where kids recognized to be at risk still fall through the net because of inadequate cooperation between education authorities and the youth welfare offices . " in future , we will alert the youth welfare office every time there is grounds for suspicion that parents are failing to send their child to school , " said hamburg education senator alexandra dinges-dierg in the wake of jessica 's death . such a move might have saved this particular child 's life .
as it is , an acute lack of communication from department to department is widely acknowledged to be the main obstacle in germany to creating a functioning alarm system against child neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutscher kinderschutzbund e.v.
" what we need are colleagues who are ready to work together , " said abelmann-vollmer from the child protection office -lrb- photo -rrb- . " the problem is there are too many parallel systems .
all too often , the health services , education authorities and youth welfare offices work as rivals .
their various responsibilities are firmly demarcated , and staff are too unwilling to let their tasks overlap . " legislation is not the answer jessica 's case prompted dinges-dierg to call for tightening the law enforcing school attendance .
this would allow an official from the local education authority , accompanied by a police officer , to enter homes where children are registered who either fail to attend school or have been absent for extended periods .
as it stands , parents can refuse entry . but many believe changing the law is n't the answer .
" ensuring children can lead good lives is not a question of introducing new legislation , it 's a question of creating a more child-friendly society , " insisted abelmann-vollmer .
" we need recognition for working parents and more support structures for them to turn to . " society 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ageing population and dwindling birth rate are symptomatic of another issue .
children are increasingly marginalized here .
unemployment , poverty and social isolation are all factors that leave many parents unable to cope with the demands of bringing up children - moreover , without the traditional help of the extended family . " the child protection association believes child-rearing is the responsibility of the whole of society , " argued abelmann-vollmer .
" it 's not that you should call the police when you hear the family next door arguing ; it 's that you should offer to look after their children so they can go buy the groceries . " deligöz is more reluctant to pass the buck .
" the concept of the family has changed , " she said .
" we no longer live in extended families , and society has had to take its place .
but we ca n't make society responsible for everything . " von pirani expressed similar sentiments .
" family is a very private matter in germany , " she said .
" that explains why there was no one close to jessica who could alert anyone to what was happening .
that was what was lacking .

" in future , we will alert the youth welfare office every time there is grounds for suspicion that parents are failing to send their child to school , " said hamburg education senator alexandra dinges-dierg in the wake of jessica 's death . such a move might have saved this particular child 's life .
as it is , an acute lack of communication from department to department is widely acknowledged to be the main obstacle in germany to creating a functioning alarm system against child neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutscher kinderschutzbund e.v.
" what we need are colleagues who are ready to work together , " said abelmann-vollmer from the child protection office -lrb- photo -rrb- . " the problem is there are too many parallel systems .
all too often , the health services , education authorities and youth welfare offices work as rivals .
their various responsibilities are firmly demarcated , and staff are too unwilling to let their tasks overlap . " legislation is not the answer jessica 's case prompted dinges-dierg to call for tightening the law enforcing school attendance .
this would allow an official from the local education authority , accompanied by a police officer , to enter homes where children are registered who either fail to attend school or have been absent for extended periods .
as it stands , parents can refuse entry . but many believe changing the law is n't the answer .
" ensuring children can lead good lives is not a question of introducing new legislation , it 's a question of creating a more child-friendly society , " insisted abelmann-vollmer .
" we need recognition for working parents and more support structures for them to turn to . " society 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ageing population and dwindling birth rate are symptomatic of another issue .
children are increasingly marginalized here .
unemployment , poverty and social isolation are all factors that leave many parents unable to cope with the demands of bringing up children - moreover , without the traditional help of the extended family . " the child protection association believes child-rearing is the responsibility of the whole of society , " argued abelmann-vollmer .
" it 's not that you should call the police when you hear the family next door arguing ; it 's that you should offer to look after their children so they can go buy the groceries . " deligöz is more reluctant to pass the buck .
" the concept of the family has changed , " she said .
" we no longer live in extended families , and society has had to take its place .
but we ca n't make society responsible for everything . " von pirani expressed similar sentiments .
" family is a very private matter in germany , " she said .
" that explains why there was no one close to jessica who could alert anyone to what was happening .
that was what was lacking .
we ca n't expect the state to keep tabs on everyone and everything .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2005 oh lord , what freaks ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rock n ' roll religion europe is in the clutch of a new religious craze .
known as the " jesus freaks , " these pious , fundamentalist christians are giving the established church a run for its money . they do n't take drugs , do n't believe in sex before marriage and slam homosexuality as a disease , but for all that , the jesus freaks distance themselves from the idea of political conservatism .
rather than running around bashing their bibles , they are more likely to be found banging their heads to the din of trash metal . it all began back in 1991 in a bedroom in the city of hamburg .
three spiritual souls came clean and admitted their shared wish to make jesus a part of their lives .
united in their belief that their saviour rose from the dead 2,000 years ago and is still alive today , they made it their mission to activate him in their lives .
it was the first time they had felt free enough to drop their guard and began to pray . bildunterschrift : rejoicing in the freedom of freaky christianity " in front of god , we were able to be ourselves and we wanted everything he had to give us .
most people who joined our meetings later , came because they believed in jesus but had struggled to be accepted as they are , " the freaks say on their web site . real freaks or just colorful christians ? they go on to explain that despite crucifixion , witch burning , boring church sermons and pseudo-religious fuss , they believe there is something intrinsically real and fascinating about jesus .
at first glance , their statements read a little like the words of quirky jesus disciples , but on closer inspection , it 's clear that they are serious about christian work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life the jesus way ?
tobi kaiser is one of around 2,500 german freaks and head of the north rhine-westphalian branch of the movement .
the 31-year-old , a lay vicar in cologne , is absolutely dedicated to his life as a freak and believes their way of doing things is the perfect replacement for the dry nature of the official church .
he credo is to " live his whole life the jesus way . " in place of the usual liturgical fare of traditional sermons , the jesus freaks in cologne offer their congregation an altogether different approach .
tobi says they have their " own language , their own music , and the whole thing in a cosy living room environment . "
they meet in a former bar , where they can walk about , dance or just hang out on the sofa , drinking the beer that they are free to bring along . out with the staid , in with the new crusade " the jesus freaks fill the spiritual vacuum left open by the official church , " says klaus farin , who runs the berlin archive for youth culture and has written a book about the group .
his analysis led him to the conclusion that " lively events are much more successful than the sometimes slowcoach church approach to youth work . " bildunterschrift : singing the gospel whether through trash metal concerts or river christening ceremonies , the jesus freaks know how to help youngsters who are struggling to find their religious center .
it 's a sigh of hallelujah for those concerned , but the protestant church feels the throb of having its nose knocked out of joint . " there are differences of opinion in the practice of christening ceremonies and with regard to questions of style , " said reinhard hempelmann of the protestant center of ideology .
but he does say that the work of the freaks , when it comes to the meaning of the christian faith , is " commendable . " so does that mean it is time for a new ecumenical movement ?
perhaps on the outside , that is what has already begun to grow , but in terms of the content being preached , the gulf between the traditional church-goers and the freaks is not as wide as it might initially seem . marcus bösch -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?

jessica may have been one of germany 's " invisible children , " but there are many other cases where kids recognized to be at risk still fall through the net because of inadequate cooperation between education authorities and the youth welfare offices . " in future , we will alert the youth welfare office every time there is grounds for suspicion that parents are failing to send their child to school , " said hamburg education senator alexandra dinges-dierg in the wake of jessica 's death . such a move might have saved this particular child 's life .
as it is , an acute lack of communication from department to department is widely acknowledged to be the main obstacle in germany to creating a functioning alarm system against child neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutscher kinderschutzbund e.v.
" what we need are colleagues who are ready to work together , " said abelmann-vollmer from the child protection office -lrb- photo -rrb- . " the problem is there are too many parallel systems .
all too often , the health services , education authorities and youth welfare offices work as rivals .
their various responsibilities are firmly demarcated , and staff are too unwilling to let their tasks overlap . " legislation is not the answer jessica 's case prompted dinges-dierg to call for tightening the law enforcing school attendance .
this would allow an official from the local education authority , accompanied by a police officer , to enter homes where children are registered who either fail to attend school or have been absent for extended periods .
as it stands , parents can refuse entry . but many believe changing the law is n't the answer .
" ensuring children can lead good lives is not a question of introducing new legislation , it 's a question of creating a more child-friendly society , " insisted abelmann-vollmer .
" we need recognition for working parents and more support structures for them to turn to . " society 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ageing population and dwindling birth rate are symptomatic of another issue .
children are increasingly marginalized here .
unemployment , poverty and social isolation are all factors that leave many parents unable to cope with the demands of bringing up children - moreover , without the traditional help of the extended family . " the child protection association believes child-rearing is the responsibility of the whole of society , " argued abelmann-vollmer .
" it 's not that you should call the police when you hear the family next door arguing ; it 's that you should offer to look after their children so they can go buy the groceries . " deligöz is more reluctant to pass the buck .
" the concept of the family has changed , " she said .
" we no longer live in extended families , and society has had to take its place .
but we ca n't make society responsible for everything . " von pirani expressed similar sentiments .
" family is a very private matter in germany , " she said .
" that explains why there was no one close to jessica who could alert anyone to what was happening .
that was what was lacking .
we ca n't expect the state to keep tabs on everyone and everything .

some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .

under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .
and not even the supporters of the basic income model can say for sure whether there would be enough political will to see through such a change . monika hogen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

a spokesman for uefa said this week that the organization is trying to convince frisk to stay on board . frisk often the victim referee representatives say the climate is such that coaches and fans seem to think they can criticize at will . swiss ref urs meier had suffered a deluge of threats from england fans after making a controversial call against the english side in the european soccer championships last june . a paper had published his home address and phone number .
frisk was hit in the head by a flying object during a champion 's league match he refereed in september between as rome and dynamo kiev in rome .
uefa officials immediately called off the match and awarded the win to kiev .
a few months later , fans threw objects at him as he refereed a game between werder bremen and fc valencia . " his resignation is the result of the irresponsibility on the part of managers , " said volker roth , head of the german and european referees .
" they encourage the fans with their behavior .
i imagine frisk wo n't be the last to say , ' i wo n't allow myself and my family to go through that . ' " chelsea coach blamed roth took special aim at jose mourinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , chelsea 's flamboyant and controversial coach .
following the match , mourinho raised uefa 's ire by alleging that frisk consulted with fc barcelona coach frank rijkaard during halftime of the match .
the accusations were later proved to be unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose mourinho 's chelsea is leading atop the english league standings and is a favorite to win the champion 's league .
" people like mourinho are the enemy of soccer , " roth told the swedish daily aftonbladet .
he has refused to apologize for the remarks and appeared nonplussed at mourinho 's announcement that he planned to file a complaint against roth . roth appears to be getting support from other corners .
the president of the world soccer body fifa told reporters that " those who attack referees , attack soccer . " considering a strike germany 's own referee community has shown solidarity with the swede .
they have criticized the fact that refs are n't allowed at postgame press conferences to reply to coach criticism and the endless replay of controversial calls on television . " the question is whether you have to show every controversial episode over and over again in video replay , like we do in germany , and then mercilessly criticize my colleagues , " said referee eugen strigel in a newspaper interview .

europe 's referees say enough is enough and are considering striking . for a period of two weeks , referee anders frisk 's life and that of his family was a living hell . death threats , in the form of phone calls and letters , arrived at his home in sweden on a daily basis .
fans of the london soccer club chelsea , angry at him for awarding a red card to one of their players in a champion 's league match against fc barcelona , would n't let up .

a spokesman for uefa said this week that the organization is trying to convince frisk to stay on board . frisk often the victim referee representatives say the climate is such that coaches and fans seem to think they can criticize at will . swiss ref urs meier had suffered a deluge of threats from england fans after making a controversial call against the english side in the european soccer championships last june . a paper had published his home address and phone number .
frisk was hit in the head by a flying object during a champion 's league match he refereed in september between as rome and dynamo kiev in rome .

" people like mourinho are the enemy of soccer , " roth told the swedish daily aftonbladet .
he has refused to apologize for the remarks and appeared nonplussed at mourinho 's announcement that he planned to file a complaint against roth . roth appears to be getting support from other corners .
the president of the world soccer body fifa told reporters that " those who attack referees , attack soccer . " considering a strike germany 's own referee community has shown solidarity with the swede .
they have criticized the fact that refs are n't allowed at postgame press conferences to reply to coach criticism and the endless replay of controversial calls on television . " the question is whether you have to show every controversial episode over and over again in video replay , like we do in germany , and then mercilessly criticize my colleagues , " said referee eugen strigel in a newspaper interview .
" to ref a match mistake-free is impossible . " though europe 's referees have not yet threatened to go on strike , roth said it was a " legal means " to express frustration with the state of affairs .

europe 's referees say enough is enough and are considering striking . for a period of two weeks , referee anders frisk 's life and that of his family was a living hell . death threats , in the form of phone calls and letters , arrived at his home in sweden on a daily basis .
fans of the london soccer club chelsea , angry at him for awarding a red card to one of their players in a champion 's league match against fc barcelona , would n't let up .
" those were the worst 16 days of my career , " said frisk upon stepping down .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after dimissing chelsea striker didier drogba -lrb- l . -rrb- with a yellow-red card in this champion 's league match in barcelona , fc barcelona used the man-advantage to turn the game and win 2-1 . roughly a year before germany gets ready to host the world cup , european soccer 's governing body uefa is without one of their top referees and facing increasing criticism that not enough is being done to protect them .
a spokesman for uefa said this week that the organization is trying to convince frisk to stay on board . frisk often the victim referee representatives say the climate is such that coaches and fans seem to think they can criticize at will . swiss ref urs meier had suffered a deluge of threats from england fans after making a controversial call against the english side in the european soccer championships last june . a paper had published his home address and phone number .
frisk was hit in the head by a flying object during a champion 's league match he refereed in september between as rome and dynamo kiev in rome .
uefa officials immediately called off the match and awarded the win to kiev .
a few months later , fans threw objects at him as he refereed a game between werder bremen and fc valencia . " his resignation is the result of the irresponsibility on the part of managers , " said volker roth , head of the german and european referees .
" they encourage the fans with their behavior .
i imagine frisk wo n't be the last to say , ' i wo n't allow myself and my family to go through that . ' " chelsea coach blamed roth took special aim at jose mourinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , chelsea 's flamboyant and controversial coach .

the accusations were later proved to be unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose mourinho 's chelsea is leading atop the english league standings and is a favorite to win the champion 's league .
" people like mourinho are the enemy of soccer , " roth told the swedish daily aftonbladet .
he has refused to apologize for the remarks and appeared nonplussed at mourinho 's announcement that he planned to file a complaint against roth . roth appears to be getting support from other corners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .
and not even the supporters of the basic income model can say for sure whether there would be enough political will to see through such a change . monika hogen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .

so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .

across the continent , governments are wondering if wolfowitz has the right credentials for the position .
but they 're well aware how much is at stake . " i doubt the europeans will be able to block it as george w. bush probably cleared it among european leaders : tony blair and possibly even jacques chirac , " fraser cameron , director of studies at the european policy center in brussels , told afp . " the issue appears to be a done deal , " agreed jerome sgard , a senior economist at the center for prospective studies and international information -lrb- ceepi -rrb- in paris .
" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .
" with wolfowitz , we ca n't really say that he is incompetent .
it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .
" it would risk reopening a highly visible conflict where once again we would have europeans opposing the americans on a decision that in principle is theirs to make . " through an informal agreement between the founding member states of the two bodies , the united states traditionally nominates the world bank president and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .
the relationship , though very friendly , is anything but normal , say experts .
and that wo n't change any time soon .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .

across the continent , governments are wondering if wolfowitz has the right credentials for the position .
but they 're well aware how much is at stake . " i doubt the europeans will be able to block it as george w. bush probably cleared it among european leaders : tony blair and possibly even jacques chirac , " fraser cameron , director of studies at the european policy center in brussels , told afp . " the issue appears to be a done deal , " agreed jerome sgard , a senior economist at the center for prospective studies and international information -lrb- ceepi -rrb- in paris .
" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .

it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .
" it would risk reopening a highly visible conflict where once again we would have europeans opposing the americans on a decision that in principle is theirs to make . " through an informal agreement between the founding member states of the two bodies , the united states traditionally nominates the world bank president and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " it 's a negative decision , but not a surprising one , " said rafael villacis of san pablo university in madrid , adding that putting wolfowitz at the head of the world bank would empty the institution of its " social aspect " . but haine countered with a positive way for europe to view the nomination . " the white house is getting rid of the most virulent neo-conservatives like john bolton and paul wolfowitz by placing them at international institutions - meaning they are no longer in charge of american policy , " he said . enthusiasm in germany limited in germany , michael müller , the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , described the choice as " horrifying .

" " the opportunity of working to lift a billion people who earn less than a dollar a day out of poverty and billions of others who live in circumstances of poverty , to give them a chance in life , is an exciting responsibility and a real challenge , " he said . as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . but the institution has also been accused of backing grandiose development projects which have little economic worth and of fostering poverty by driving nations deeper into debt . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of german-us relations with president george w. bush heading for germany wednesday , united states expert knud krakau analyzed the state of relations between the two countries in an interview with dw-world .

so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.03.2005 clamping down on child neglect 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of mourners attended jessica 's burial in hamburg one of the shocking aspects of the recent harrowing death of a seven-year-old girl in hamburg was the fact that hers was not an isolated case .
so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .

europe 's referees say enough is enough and are considering striking . for a period of two weeks , referee anders frisk 's life and that of his family was a living hell . death threats , in the form of phone calls and letters , arrived at his home in sweden on a daily basis .
fans of the london soccer club chelsea , angry at him for awarding a red card to one of their players in a champion 's league match against fc barcelona , would n't let up .
" those were the worst 16 days of my career , " said frisk upon stepping down .

a spokesman for uefa said this week that the organization is trying to convince frisk to stay on board . frisk often the victim referee representatives say the climate is such that coaches and fans seem to think they can criticize at will . swiss ref urs meier had suffered a deluge of threats from england fans after making a controversial call against the english side in the european soccer championships last june . a paper had published his home address and phone number .
frisk was hit in the head by a flying object during a champion 's league match he refereed in september between as rome and dynamo kiev in rome .
uefa officials immediately called off the match and awarded the win to kiev .
a few months later , fans threw objects at him as he refereed a game between werder bremen and fc valencia . " his resignation is the result of the irresponsibility on the part of managers , " said volker roth , head of the german and european referees .
" they encourage the fans with their behavior .

the accusations were later proved to be unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose mourinho 's chelsea is leading atop the english league standings and is a favorite to win the champion 's league .
" people like mourinho are the enemy of soccer , " roth told the swedish daily aftonbladet .
he has refused to apologize for the remarks and appeared nonplussed at mourinho 's announcement that he planned to file a complaint against roth . roth appears to be getting support from other corners .
the president of the world soccer body fifa told reporters that " those who attack referees , attack soccer . " considering a strike germany 's own referee community has shown solidarity with the swede .
they have criticized the fact that refs are n't allowed at postgame press conferences to reply to coach criticism and the endless replay of controversial calls on television . " the question is whether you have to show every controversial episode over and over again in video replay , like we do in germany , and then mercilessly criticize my colleagues , " said referee eugen strigel in a newspaper interview .
" to ref a match mistake-free is impossible . " though europe 's referees have not yet threatened to go on strike , roth said it was a " legal means " to express frustration with the state of affairs .

fans of the london soccer club chelsea , angry at him for awarding a red card to one of their players in a champion 's league match against fc barcelona , would n't let up .

a spokesman for uefa said this week that the organization is trying to convince frisk to stay on board . frisk often the victim referee representatives say the climate is such that coaches and fans seem to think they can criticize at will . swiss ref urs meier had suffered a deluge of threats from england fans after making a controversial call against the english side in the european soccer championships last june . a paper had published his home address and phone number .

a spokesperson for the ministry of justice confirmed that there are " two possibilities in discussion at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making a go of it alone is not without trials here the former plan has the greater potential for meeting with resistance and sparking debate .
on the one hand there are the corporate law experts who are favor of relaxing the financial conditions for germans considering going it alone , citing great britain and france as examples of countries where entrepreneurs do n't need any of their own capital . traditional tough line but that view is shunned by traditionalists , who believe that one way to reduce the annual number of liquidations in germany is to make start-up conditions tougher than they are now .
their belief is that the more money business novices bring with them into their new working lives , the greater the likelihood they will succeed . the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- is also in favour of raising the level of entry cash .
but in reality , the current economic climate in germany could make such measures a step in the wrong direction . a report commissioned by the kfw bank group , and published this week , revealed that although last year witnessed an increase in the number of people setting up on their own as a way out of financially desperate times , the number of those seizing the opportunity to fill genuine holes in the market had dropped significantly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ich ags are still popular with the unemployed thus , the increase can be largely attributed to those on government-funded self-starter programs .
sixteen percent of these state-backed business ventures for the unemployed , known as ich ags or " me , incorporated , " were registered in 2004 . back to work frank wallau of germany 's institute for small and medium-sized enterprises is a great believer the concept of self-employment as a way of helping the jobless back into the labor market . " ich ags have become an instrument to get people working again , and that is a good thing , " he said .
" to what extent they are viable ideas which survive , however , remains to be seen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : super chef jamie oliver is one example of a british success story the cologne-based research group which carried out the survey examined the current start-up climate in germany , and compared it with that in thirty other countries .
they found that in spite of the overall growth in the number of new companies , of all the countries included in the survey , germans were the most pessimistic about staying afloat as their own boss . only 13 percent of those asked expressed a belief that they could succeed , compared with 38 and 34 percent in the netherlands and the united states respectively . no second chance frank wallau believes the negative attitude towards self-employment is related to the lack of a second-chance culture in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more flexibility required from german banks " in some countries , there 's an attitude which allows you to fail once and try again , and then if you fail twice , it 's a case of third time lucky .
that is not the way it works here .
if your business fails , it is very difficult to get a second chance , " said wallau . but he believes there will be a shift " once people start to see restarters as an economic phenomenon and conditions improve .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2005 europe ponders wolfowitz nomination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " architect of the iraq war , " wolfowitz is n't popular in germany most european states will accept bush 's nomination of paul wolfowitz as world bank chief , as a veto would reverse the thaw in transatlantic relations , analysts said thursday . a day after bush put forward his arch-conservative deputy defense secretary as world bank chief , europe is still mulling the controversial choice .
across the continent , governments are wondering if wolfowitz has the right credentials for the position .
but they 're well aware how much is at stake . " i doubt the europeans will be able to block it as george w. bush probably cleared it among european leaders : tony blair and possibly even jacques chirac , " fraser cameron , director of studies at the european policy center in brussels , told afp . " the issue appears to be a done deal , " agreed jerome sgard , a senior economist at the center for prospective studies and international information -lrb- ceepi -rrb- in paris .
" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .
" with wolfowitz , we ca n't really say that he is incompetent .
it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .
" it would risk reopening a highly visible conflict where once again we would have europeans opposing the americans on a decision that in principle is theirs to make . " through an informal agreement between the founding member states of the two bodies , the united states traditionally nominates the world bank president and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " it 's a negative decision , but not a surprising one , " said rafael villacis of san pablo university in madrid , adding that putting wolfowitz at the head of the world bank would empty the institution of its " social aspect " . but haine countered with a positive way for europe to view the nomination . " the white house is getting rid of the most virulent neo-conservatives like john bolton and paul wolfowitz by placing them at international institutions - meaning they are no longer in charge of american policy , " he said . enthusiasm in germany limited in germany , michael müller , the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , described the choice as " horrifying . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " wolfowitz is a hawk who has repeatedly proved that he is a firebrand , " he went on .
according to müller , wolfowitz 's appointment would put the world economy at risk of being taken over by a military mind-set of repression and supremacy . " our enthusiasm in ' old ' europe is limited , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . threat to trans-atlantic consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james d. wolfensohn current world bank president james wolfensohn -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down this summer . analysts had said wednesday that bush 's nomination of wolfowitz threatened to put that transatlantic consensus to the test . aside from iraq , wolfowitz has attracted criticism from many as a leading light of the neo-conservative movement , which wants the us to impose its vision of liberal democracy and free-market economics on others . according to reuters , staff at the world bank itself are concerned that his links to the iraq war could undermine the bank 's credibility . but the 61-year-old former academic sought to win over his detractors by declaring that he believed " deeply and passionately in the mission of the world bank . " " the opportunity of working to lift a billion people who earn less than a dollar a day out of poverty and billions of others who live in circumstances of poverty , to give them a chance in life , is an exciting responsibility and a real challenge , " he said . as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . but the institution has also been accused of backing grandiose development projects which have little economic worth and of fostering poverty by driving nations deeper into debt . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of german-us relations with president george w. bush heading for germany wednesday , united states expert knud krakau analyzed the state of relations between the two countries in an interview with dw-world .

across the continent , governments are wondering if wolfowitz has the right credentials for the position .
but they 're well aware how much is at stake . " i doubt the europeans will be able to block it as george w. bush probably cleared it among european leaders : tony blair and possibly even jacques chirac , " fraser cameron , director of studies at the european policy center in brussels , told afp . " the issue appears to be a done deal , " agreed jerome sgard , a senior economist at the center for prospective studies and international information -lrb- ceepi -rrb- in paris .
" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .
" with wolfowitz , we ca n't really say that he is incompetent .
it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .
" it would risk reopening a highly visible conflict where once again we would have europeans opposing the americans on a decision that in principle is theirs to make . " through an informal agreement between the founding member states of the two bodies , the united states traditionally nominates the world bank president and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " it 's a negative decision , but not a surprising one , " said rafael villacis of san pablo university in madrid , adding that putting wolfowitz at the head of the world bank would empty the institution of its " social aspect " . but haine countered with a positive way for europe to view the nomination . " the white house is getting rid of the most virulent neo-conservatives like john bolton and paul wolfowitz by placing them at international institutions - meaning they are no longer in charge of american policy , " he said . enthusiasm in germany limited in germany , michael müller , the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , described the choice as " horrifying . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " wolfowitz is a hawk who has repeatedly proved that he is a firebrand , " he went on .
according to müller , wolfowitz 's appointment would put the world economy at risk of being taken over by a military mind-set of repression and supremacy . " our enthusiasm in ' old ' europe is limited , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . threat to trans-atlantic consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james d. wolfensohn current world bank president james wolfensohn -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down this summer . analysts had said wednesday that bush 's nomination of wolfowitz threatened to put that transatlantic consensus to the test . aside from iraq , wolfowitz has attracted criticism from many as a leading light of the neo-conservative movement , which wants the us to impose its vision of liberal democracy and free-market economics on others . according to reuters , staff at the world bank itself are concerned that his links to the iraq war could undermine the bank 's credibility . but the 61-year-old former academic sought to win over his detractors by declaring that he believed " deeply and passionately in the mission of the world bank . " " the opportunity of working to lift a billion people who earn less than a dollar a day out of poverty and billions of others who live in circumstances of poverty , to give them a chance in life , is an exciting responsibility and a real challenge , " he said . as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . but the institution has also been accused of backing grandiose development projects which have little economic worth and of fostering poverty by driving nations deeper into debt . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of german-us relations with president george w. bush heading for germany wednesday , united states expert knud krakau analyzed the state of relations between the two countries in an interview with dw-world .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .

some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .

some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income .

so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

jessica may have been one of germany 's " invisible children , " but there are many other cases where kids recognized to be at risk still fall through the net because of inadequate cooperation between education authorities and the youth welfare offices . " in future , we will alert the youth welfare office every time there is grounds for suspicion that parents are failing to send their child to school , " said hamburg education senator alexandra dinges-dierg in the wake of jessica 's death . such a move might have saved this particular child 's life .
as it is , an acute lack of communication from department to department is widely acknowledged to be the main obstacle in germany to creating a functioning alarm system against child neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutscher kinderschutzbund e.v.
" what we need are colleagues who are ready to work together , " said abelmann-vollmer from the child protection office -lrb- photo -rrb- . " the problem is there are too many parallel systems .
all too often , the health services , education authorities and youth welfare offices work as rivals .
their various responsibilities are firmly demarcated , and staff are too unwilling to let their tasks overlap . " legislation is not the answer jessica 's case prompted dinges-dierg to call for tightening the law enforcing school attendance .
this would allow an official from the local education authority , accompanied by a police officer , to enter homes where children are registered who either fail to attend school or have been absent for extended periods .
as it stands , parents can refuse entry . but many believe changing the law is n't the answer .
" ensuring children can lead good lives is not a question of introducing new legislation , it 's a question of creating a more child-friendly society , " insisted abelmann-vollmer .
" we need recognition for working parents and more support structures for them to turn to . " society 's role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ageing population and dwindling birth rate are symptomatic of another issue .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer .

some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .
the relationship , though very friendly , is anything but normal , say experts .
and that wo n't change any time soon .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .

i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .
and not even the supporters of the basic income model can say for sure whether there would be enough political will to see through such a change . monika hogen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

carrafiell 's comments echoed a recent report by the royal institute of chartered surveyors which described the german housing market as a " long-term stagnant market which appears to be picking up as owner-occupiers increase their mortgage demands . "
the report also found some regional differences , with east germany still afflicted by oversupply of housing , whilst house prices in cities like munich and frankfurt have seen moderate growth . dw-world.de steven seagal is hard to prosecute three years after action-movie star steven seagal and crew stayed in her villa , a berlin landlady is still fighting the martial arts expert in the german courts over the damage he allegedly inflicted on her property .

when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .

" a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .

" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .

across the continent , governments are wondering if wolfowitz has the right credentials for the position .
but they 're well aware how much is at stake . " i doubt the europeans will be able to block it as george w. bush probably cleared it among european leaders : tony blair and possibly even jacques chirac , " fraser cameron , director of studies at the european policy center in brussels , told afp . " the issue appears to be a done deal , " agreed jerome sgard , a senior economist at the center for prospective studies and international information -lrb- ceepi -rrb- in paris .
" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .
" with wolfowitz , we ca n't really say that he is incompetent .
it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .
" it would risk reopening a highly visible conflict where once again we would have europeans opposing the americans on a decision that in principle is theirs to make . " through an informal agreement between the founding member states of the two bodies , the united states traditionally nominates the world bank president and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " it 's a negative decision , but not a surprising one , " said rafael villacis of san pablo university in madrid , adding that putting wolfowitz at the head of the world bank would empty the institution of its " social aspect " . but haine countered with a positive way for europe to view the nomination . " the white house is getting rid of the most virulent neo-conservatives like john bolton and paul wolfowitz by placing them at international institutions - meaning they are no longer in charge of american policy , " he said . enthusiasm in germany limited in germany , michael müller , the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , described the choice as " horrifying . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " wolfowitz is a hawk who has repeatedly proved that he is a firebrand , " he went on .
according to müller , wolfowitz 's appointment would put the world economy at risk of being taken over by a military mind-set of repression and supremacy . " our enthusiasm in ' old ' europe is limited , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . threat to trans-atlantic consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james d. wolfensohn current world bank president james wolfensohn -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down this summer . analysts had said wednesday that bush 's nomination of wolfowitz threatened to put that transatlantic consensus to the test . aside from iraq , wolfowitz has attracted criticism from many as a leading light of the neo-conservative movement , which wants the us to impose its vision of liberal democracy and free-market economics on others . according to reuters , staff at the world bank itself are concerned that his links to the iraq war could undermine the bank 's credibility . but the 61-year-old former academic sought to win over his detractors by declaring that he believed " deeply and passionately in the mission of the world bank . " " the opportunity of working to lift a billion people who earn less than a dollar a day out of poverty and billions of others who live in circumstances of poverty , to give them a chance in life , is an exciting responsibility and a real challenge , " he said . as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . but the institution has also been accused of backing grandiose development projects which have little economic worth and of fostering poverty by driving nations deeper into debt . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of german-us relations with president george w. bush heading for germany wednesday , united states expert knud krakau analyzed the state of relations between the two countries in an interview with dw-world .

europe 's referees say enough is enough and are considering striking . for a period of two weeks , referee anders frisk 's life and that of his family was a living hell . death threats , in the form of phone calls and letters , arrived at his home in sweden on a daily basis .
fans of the london soccer club chelsea , angry at him for awarding a red card to one of their players in a champion 's league match against fc barcelona , would n't let up .
" those were the worst 16 days of my career , " said frisk upon stepping down .
" i would n't let my daughter open the mailbox anymore , out of fear . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after dimissing chelsea striker didier drogba -lrb- l . -rrb- with a yellow-red card in this champion 's league match in barcelona , fc barcelona used the man-advantage to turn the game and win 2-1 . roughly a year before germany gets ready to host the world cup , european soccer 's governing body uefa is without one of their top referees and facing increasing criticism that not enough is being done to protect them .
a spokesman for uefa said this week that the organization is trying to convince frisk to stay on board . frisk often the victim referee representatives say the climate is such that coaches and fans seem to think they can criticize at will . swiss ref urs meier had suffered a deluge of threats from england fans after making a controversial call against the english side in the european soccer championships last june . a paper had published his home address and phone number .
frisk was hit in the head by a flying object during a champion 's league match he refereed in september between as rome and dynamo kiev in rome .
uefa officials immediately called off the match and awarded the win to kiev .
a few months later , fans threw objects at him as he refereed a game between werder bremen and fc valencia . " his resignation is the result of the irresponsibility on the part of managers , " said volker roth , head of the german and european referees .
" they encourage the fans with their behavior .
i imagine frisk wo n't be the last to say , ' i wo n't allow myself and my family to go through that . ' " chelsea coach blamed roth took special aim at jose mourinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , chelsea 's flamboyant and controversial coach .
following the match , mourinho raised uefa 's ire by alleging that frisk consulted with fc barcelona coach frank rijkaard during halftime of the match .
the accusations were later proved to be unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose mourinho 's chelsea is leading atop the english league standings and is a favorite to win the champion 's league .
" people like mourinho are the enemy of soccer , " roth told the swedish daily aftonbladet .
he has refused to apologize for the remarks and appeared nonplussed at mourinho 's announcement that he planned to file a complaint against roth . roth appears to be getting support from other corners .
the president of the world soccer body fifa told reporters that " those who attack referees , attack soccer . " considering a strike germany 's own referee community has shown solidarity with the swede .
they have criticized the fact that refs are n't allowed at postgame press conferences to reply to coach criticism and the endless replay of controversial calls on television . " the question is whether you have to show every controversial episode over and over again in video replay , like we do in germany , and then mercilessly criticize my colleagues , " said referee eugen strigel in a newspaper interview .
" to ref a match mistake-free is impossible . " though europe 's referees have not yet threatened to go on strike , roth said it was a " legal means " to express frustration with the state of affairs . " we ca n't just stand by helplessly , " said roth in an interview with a german sports wire service .
" i 'm really not a friend of strikes , but we need to consider measures " to fight back . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

across the continent , governments are wondering if wolfowitz has the right credentials for the position .
but they 're well aware how much is at stake . " i doubt the europeans will be able to block it as george w. bush probably cleared it among european leaders : tony blair and possibly even jacques chirac , " fraser cameron , director of studies at the european policy center in brussels , told afp . " the issue appears to be a done deal , " agreed jerome sgard , a senior economist at the center for prospective studies and international information -lrb- ceepi -rrb- in paris .
" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .
" with wolfowitz , we ca n't really say that he is incompetent .
it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .
" it would risk reopening a highly visible conflict where once again we would have europeans opposing the americans on a decision that in principle is theirs to make . " through an informal agreement between the founding member states of the two bodies , the united states traditionally nominates the world bank president and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " it 's a negative decision , but not a surprising one , " said rafael villacis of san pablo university in madrid , adding that putting wolfowitz at the head of the world bank would empty the institution of its " social aspect " . but haine countered with a positive way for europe to view the nomination . " the white house is getting rid of the most virulent neo-conservatives like john bolton and paul wolfowitz by placing them at international institutions - meaning they are no longer in charge of american policy , " he said . enthusiasm in germany limited in germany , michael müller , the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , described the choice as " horrifying . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " wolfowitz is a hawk who has repeatedly proved that he is a firebrand , " he went on .
according to müller , wolfowitz 's appointment would put the world economy at risk of being taken over by a military mind-set of repression and supremacy . " our enthusiasm in ' old ' europe is limited , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . threat to trans-atlantic consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james d. wolfensohn current world bank president james wolfensohn -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down this summer . analysts had said wednesday that bush 's nomination of wolfowitz threatened to put that transatlantic consensus to the test . aside from iraq , wolfowitz has attracted criticism from many as a leading light of the neo-conservative movement , which wants the us to impose its vision of liberal democracy and free-market economics on others . according to reuters , staff at the world bank itself are concerned that his links to the iraq war could undermine the bank 's credibility . but the 61-year-old former academic sought to win over his detractors by declaring that he believed " deeply and passionately in the mission of the world bank . " " the opportunity of working to lift a billion people who earn less than a dollar a day out of poverty and billions of others who live in circumstances of poverty , to give them a chance in life , is an exciting responsibility and a real challenge , " he said . as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . but the institution has also been accused of backing grandiose development projects which have little economic worth and of fostering poverty by driving nations deeper into debt . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of german-us relations with president george w. bush heading for germany wednesday , united states expert knud krakau analyzed the state of relations between the two countries in an interview with dw-world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained reform opponents ponder " what now ? " in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .

john carrafiell , head of european real estate at investment bankers morgan stanley told reporters that the boom in german property was the investment opportunity du jour during a speech at the annual mipim property trade fair in cannes on wednesday .
carrafiell 's comments echoed a recent report by the royal institute of chartered surveyors which described the german housing market as a " long-term stagnant market which appears to be picking up as owner-occupiers increase their mortgage demands . "
the report also found some regional differences , with east germany still afflicted by oversupply of housing , whilst house prices in cities like munich and frankfurt have seen moderate growth . dw-world.de steven seagal is hard to prosecute three years after action-movie star steven seagal and crew stayed in her villa , a berlin landlady is still fighting the martial arts expert in the german courts over the damage he allegedly inflicted on her property .

so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .

" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .
" with wolfowitz , we ca n't really say that he is incompetent .
it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .

" " the opportunity of working to lift a billion people who earn less than a dollar a day out of poverty and billions of others who live in circumstances of poverty , to give them a chance in life , is an exciting responsibility and a real challenge , " he said . as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . but the institution has also been accused of backing grandiose development projects which have little economic worth and of fostering poverty by driving nations deeper into debt . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the future of german-us relations with president george w. bush heading for germany wednesday , united states expert knud krakau analyzed the state of relations between the two countries in an interview with dw-world .

so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .

her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.03.2005 europe ponders wolfowitz nomination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " architect of the iraq war , " wolfowitz is n't popular in germany most european states will accept bush 's nomination of paul wolfowitz as world bank chief , as a veto would reverse the thaw in transatlantic relations , analysts said thursday . a day after bush put forward his arch-conservative deputy defense secretary as world bank chief , europe is still mulling the controversial choice .
across the continent , governments are wondering if wolfowitz has the right credentials for the position .
but they 're well aware how much is at stake . " i doubt the europeans will be able to block it as george w. bush probably cleared it among european leaders : tony blair and possibly even jacques chirac , " fraser cameron , director of studies at the european policy center in brussels , told afp . " the issue appears to be a done deal , " agreed jerome sgard , a senior economist at the center for prospective studies and international information -lrb- ceepi -rrb- in paris .
" bush made numerous calls in europe about this subject , at the highest level .
chirac made it known right away that he was not opposed " to wolfowitz 's candidacy , sgard added . in france , chirac " took note " of wolfowitz 's candidacy and told bush in a telephone call that he would review it in a " spirit of friendship " and " with a eye on the mission " of the world bank . british foreign secretary jack straw said in brussels that wolfowitz was " very distinguished and experienced internationally and if his appointment is confirmed , we look forward to working with him " . avoiding a row the issue of competence could have been a deciding factor for european leaders unwilling to rock the boat just as relations with washington are improving , sgard suggested .
" with wolfowitz , we ca n't really say that he is incompetent .
it would be opposition for political reasons , which is much more delicate , " sgard explained .
" it would risk reopening a highly visible conflict where once again we would have europeans opposing the americans on a decision that in principle is theirs to make . " through an informal agreement between the founding member states of the two bodies , the united states traditionally nominates the world bank president and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- . " it 's a negative decision , but not a surprising one , " said rafael villacis of san pablo university in madrid , adding that putting wolfowitz at the head of the world bank would empty the institution of its " social aspect " . but haine countered with a positive way for europe to view the nomination . " the white house is getting rid of the most virulent neo-conservatives like john bolton and paul wolfowitz by placing them at international institutions - meaning they are no longer in charge of american policy , " he said . enthusiasm in germany limited in germany , michael müller , the social democrats deputy parliamentary leader , described the choice as " horrifying . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " wolfowitz is a hawk who has repeatedly proved that he is a firebrand , " he went on .
according to müller , wolfowitz 's appointment would put the world economy at risk of being taken over by a military mind-set of repression and supremacy . " our enthusiasm in ' old ' europe is limited , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul . threat to trans-atlantic consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james d. wolfensohn current world bank president james wolfensohn -lrb- photo -rrb- is to stand down this summer . analysts had said wednesday that bush 's nomination of wolfowitz threatened to put that transatlantic consensus to the test . aside from iraq , wolfowitz has attracted criticism from many as a leading light of the neo-conservative movement , which wants the us to impose its vision of liberal democracy and free-market economics on others . according to reuters , staff at the world bank itself are concerned that his links to the iraq war could undermine the bank 's credibility . but the 61-year-old former academic sought to win over his detractors by declaring that he believed " deeply and passionately in the mission of the world bank .

when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

jessica may have been one of germany 's " invisible children , " but there are many other cases where kids recognized to be at risk still fall through the net because of inadequate cooperation between education authorities and the youth welfare offices . " in future , we will alert the youth welfare office every time there is grounds for suspicion that parents are failing to send their child to school , " said hamburg education senator alexandra dinges-dierg in the wake of jessica 's death . such a move might have saved this particular child 's life .
as it is , an acute lack of communication from department to department is widely acknowledged to be the main obstacle in germany to creating a functioning alarm system against child neglect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutscher kinderschutzbund e.v.
" what we need are colleagues who are ready to work together , " said abelmann-vollmer from the child protection office -lrb- photo -rrb- . " the problem is there are too many parallel systems .

known as the " jesus freaks , " these pious , fundamentalist christians are giving the established church a run for its money . they do n't take drugs , do n't believe in sex before marriage and slam homosexuality as a disease , but for all that , the jesus freaks distance themselves from the idea of political conservatism .
rather than running around bashing their bibles , they are more likely to be found banging their heads to the din of trash metal . it all began back in 1991 in a bedroom in the city of hamburg .
three spiritual souls came clean and admitted their shared wish to make jesus a part of their lives .
united in their belief that their saviour rose from the dead 2,000 years ago and is still alive today , they made it their mission to activate him in their lives .
it was the first time they had felt free enough to drop their guard and began to pray . bildunterschrift : rejoicing in the freedom of freaky christianity " in front of god , we were able to be ourselves and we wanted everything he had to give us .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .

" in coma and looking for work germany 2004 : the road to reform business -pipe- 17.03.2005 a basic income for all ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich or poor , everyone would get the same rising unemployment figures and poverty levels in germany are begging for a solution .
some experts say the answer is doing away with welfare , and introducing a basic income for all citizens . " working for wages is a concept that will do away with itself , it 's outdated ; a basic income for all is the answer , " wrote querkopf , a newspaper for the homeless , in a recent edition .
the idea picked up by this alternative paper is n't really so alternative , according to philipp vampares .
the economics professor from belgium promotes the idea of a basic income in his books and at international conferences , including the recent world social forum held in brazil . he believes a basic income for everyone would be a good alternative to the kind of state social welfare programs seen in many european countries , germany included . " a universal program is a much better way of reaching all the poor , " vampares said .
" when there 's just a program only for poor people , it 's impossible to avoid that those people on state benefit feel stigmatized .
and it 's also hard to avoid that people on welfare become dependent on this support , because they lose their right to this income when they accept a job , even if it 's a very low-paying job .
that 's why such a system only serves to ostracize such people . " in contrast , a state-driven basic income would be paid out to rich and poor alike .
under the model , everyone has the right to earn as much as they can in addition .
a basic income for the poor is understandable , the critics say .
to them , giving money away to the rich sounds like a dubious approach to social reform .
not so , says vampares . " it 's not as revolutionary as it sounds , " he said .
" all the people that currently pay taxes in our countries , even the most wealthy , are already getting a sort of gift from the state in that there is a tax exemption for a certain percentage of their income . " under the basic income model , the wealthy would no longer have a tax-free income level .
the additional taxes collected could then be used to finance the state transfers to all citizens . saving on administration rolf künnemann of the food first information and action network -lrb- fian -rrb- , a non-governmental organization that works to protect the basic right to food , is also in favor of the idea .
additionally , he campaigns for the abolition of old-style welfare and subsidies for the poor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a basic income system would cut back on paper work , proponents say .
" the fact that the same amount would be paid to everyone would be a huge administrative relief , and it 's been suggested by many economists , even neo-liberals , " künnemann said .
" in germany , we know that social welfare is only claimed by 50 to 60 percent of those who could claim it , because it 's simply too complicated .
all the bureaucracy that 's needed to determine whether the conditions for the transfer of welfare payments have been met - that 's very expensive .
that money could be better used if it were actually included in the transfer . " one percent of gross domestic product would be enough to secure a basic income system , according to fian 's calculations . however , the really poor countries of the world do n't even have that at their disposal , nor do they have any real tax income to speak of .
the same principle that applies to development aid also applies to the basic income model : without international solidarity and the readiness of the north to financially support the south in this concept , it can not work .
and not even the supporters of the basic income model can say for sure whether there would be enough political will to see through such a change . monika hogen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .
this puts a heavy responsibility on the shoulders of europe but not a responsibility to condemn or to criticize alone but a responsibility to help both sides .
at this point in time , european sympathy , emotional support and help for both sides could be crucial . why is your most recent novel , " a tale of love and darkness , " a political book ? i think every book in the world is political on a certain level , as long as the word political does not mean a political manifesto or a political declaration .
it has a political dimension , a historical dimension because my life , the life of my family , the life of my people is soaked with politics and with history .
i could almost say that people in the middle east suffer from an overdose of politics and history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dialogue between civilians what does it mean for you that your latest book in particular is so successful in germany ? it means that the dialogue between the jewish people and germany is as intense now as it had been , let 's say , in the 1920s .
it ’ s a different dialogue .
it will never be as naive or innocent as the german-jewish dialogue in the 1920s , but it is intense and deep and meaningful for both sides , and i am very happy about it . what is your next book project ? i do n't know if their can be any other " a tale of love and darkness , " but i have just recently finished writing a short fairytale which can be read on many levels , all the way from an adventure book for young adults to a symbol and fable for readers of all ages . do you have any plans for a new political project ? i have been involved for the last 40 years in the efforts to generate compromise between israelis and palestinians .
and , of course , i plan to continue for as long as it takes .
this is not a project - this is an addiction and a way of life . klaudia prevezanos interviewed amos oz -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .

in an interview with dw-world , he spoke about german-israeli relations , the arab-israeli peace process and his recent projects . dw-world : germany and israel have had diplomatic relations now for 40 years .
what did it mean for you when the knesset voted to establish this relationship ? amos oz : it was a shock .
and even before that , i got a shock when the knesset approved the reparations agreement with germany .
i was about 12 years old at the time and i was strongly against it .
i thought it was humiliating for israel to accept reparations from the federal republic of germany .
in 1965 , when diplomatic relations were established , i was no longer against it .
my political perspective had changed .
but emotionally , of course , it was a shock .
when the first ambassador of the federal republic of germany presented his credentials to the president of israel and insisted on speaking german not english , it was more or less the first time in many , many years that the german language was transmitted over the israeli radio .
that was not a simple emotion at that time . was it the right step at the wrong time or the wrong step generally ? it was the right step and it was the right time but it was a complex and difficult step unlike any establishment of any diplomatic relations ever .
when the day comes for the israelis and the palestinians to exchange ambassadors , and such a day will come , it will be easier than the day of the establishment of the diplomatic relations between israel and the germany - emotionally easier .
by which i am not saying it was wrong or too late or too early .
i just recall how difficult it was . do you think germany and israel will ever have a normal relationship like they do with other countries ? i do n't think they want normal relations .
what we have right now is much deeper than just normal relations .
normal relation means commerce , business and good manners .
israel and germany for many years now have a very intense relationship .
there is a very intense conversation going on between german literature , israeli literature , between german public opinion and israeli public opinion , between various german ideologies and israeli ideologies .
no , i do n't ever dream of normalization .
what we have now is much better than normal relations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bestseller in germany the knesset on thursday will make another decision on the gaza strip withdrawal plan .
what do you expect ? i can not predict how they will vote but the process is inevitable even if there is a temporary hindrance or delay .
it is irrevocable because both palestinians and israelis know in their heart of hearts that at the end of the day , we have to divide the house into two apartments and live like neighbors .
even people who regard this solution as unjust know this is coming .
so what the knesset will resolve on thursday will be very important but it wo n't change the tide of history . should germany and europe keep their distance from the israeli-palestinian conflict or are they somehow responsible and should be involved ? i think germany in particular and europe in general have indeed a certain responsibility for the suffering of both sides - both sides of the israeli-arab conflict have been , in different times and in different ways , victims of europe : the arabs through colonialism , imperialism and exploitation ; the jewish people through persecution , discrimination and ultimately through genocide on an unprecedented scale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.03.2005 financial stumbling block for self-starters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being one 's own boss could cost a lot more in the future in a move likely to further prevent germans from looking at setting up their own businesses , the ministry of justice is considering upping the amount of start-up capital entrepreneurs need to get their ideas airborne . citing sources close to the government , the thursday edition of the berliner zeitung reported plans to double the current 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 33,474 -rrb- necessary to start up a new business . but the source also said berlin was looking at a second option of reducing the amount of start-up required to launch a life of business independence .
a spokesperson for the ministry of justice confirmed that there are " two possibilities in discussion at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making a go of it alone is not without trials here the former plan has the greater potential for meeting with resistance and sparking debate .
on the one hand there are the corporate law experts who are favor of relaxing the financial conditions for germans considering going it alone , citing great britain and france as examples of countries where entrepreneurs do n't need any of their own capital . traditional tough line but that view is shunned by traditionalists , who believe that one way to reduce the annual number of liquidations in germany is to make start-up conditions tougher than they are now .
their belief is that the more money business novices bring with them into their new working lives , the greater the likelihood they will succeed . the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- is also in favour of raising the level of entry cash .
but in reality , the current economic climate in germany could make such measures a step in the wrong direction . a report commissioned by the kfw bank group , and published this week , revealed that although last year witnessed an increase in the number of people setting up on their own as a way out of financially desperate times , the number of those seizing the opportunity to fill genuine holes in the market had dropped significantly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ich ags are still popular with the unemployed thus , the increase can be largely attributed to those on government-funded self-starter programs .
sixteen percent of these state-backed business ventures for the unemployed , known as ich ags or " me , incorporated , " were registered in 2004 . back to work frank wallau of germany 's institute for small and medium-sized enterprises is a great believer the concept of self-employment as a way of helping the jobless back into the labor market . " ich ags have become an instrument to get people working again , and that is a good thing , " he said .

a spokesperson for the ministry of justice confirmed that there are " two possibilities in discussion at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making a go of it alone is not without trials here the former plan has the greater potential for meeting with resistance and sparking debate .
on the one hand there are the corporate law experts who are favor of relaxing the financial conditions for germans considering going it alone , citing great britain and france as examples of countries where entrepreneurs do n't need any of their own capital . traditional tough line but that view is shunned by traditionalists , who believe that one way to reduce the annual number of liquidations in germany is to make start-up conditions tougher than they are now .
their belief is that the more money business novices bring with them into their new working lives , the greater the likelihood they will succeed . the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- is also in favour of raising the level of entry cash .
but in reality , the current economic climate in germany could make such measures a step in the wrong direction . a report commissioned by the kfw bank group , and published this week , revealed that although last year witnessed an increase in the number of people setting up on their own as a way out of financially desperate times , the number of those seizing the opportunity to fill genuine holes in the market had dropped significantly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ich ags are still popular with the unemployed thus , the increase can be largely attributed to those on government-funded self-starter programs .
sixteen percent of these state-backed business ventures for the unemployed , known as ich ags or " me , incorporated , " were registered in 2004 . back to work frank wallau of germany 's institute for small and medium-sized enterprises is a great believer the concept of self-employment as a way of helping the jobless back into the labor market . " ich ags have become an instrument to get people working again , and that is a good thing , " he said .
" to what extent they are viable ideas which survive , however , remains to be seen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : super chef jamie oliver is one example of a british success story the cologne-based research group which carried out the survey examined the current start-up climate in germany , and compared it with that in thirty other countries .
they found that in spite of the overall growth in the number of new companies , of all the countries included in the survey , germans were the most pessimistic about staying afloat as their own boss . only 13 percent of those asked expressed a belief that they could succeed , compared with 38 and 34 percent in the netherlands and the united states respectively . no second chance frank wallau believes the negative attitude towards self-employment is related to the lack of a second-chance culture in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more flexibility required from german banks " in some countries , there 's an attitude which allows you to fail once and try again , and then if you fail twice , it 's a case of third time lucky .
that is not the way it works here .
if your business fails , it is very difficult to get a second chance , " said wallau . but he believes there will be a shift " once people start to see restarters as an economic phenomenon and conditions improve .

europe 's referees say enough is enough and are considering striking . for a period of two weeks , referee anders frisk 's life and that of his family was a living hell . death threats , in the form of phone calls and letters , arrived at his home in sweden on a daily basis .
fans of the london soccer club chelsea , angry at him for awarding a red card to one of their players in a champion 's league match against fc barcelona , would n't let up .
" those were the worst 16 days of my career , " said frisk upon stepping down .
" i would n't let my daughter open the mailbox anymore , out of fear . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after dimissing chelsea striker didier drogba -lrb- l . -rrb- with a yellow-red card in this champion 's league match in barcelona , fc barcelona used the man-advantage to turn the game and win 2-1 . roughly a year before germany gets ready to host the world cup , european soccer 's governing body uefa is without one of their top referees and facing increasing criticism that not enough is being done to protect them .
a spokesman for uefa said this week that the organization is trying to convince frisk to stay on board . frisk often the victim referee representatives say the climate is such that coaches and fans seem to think they can criticize at will . swiss ref urs meier had suffered a deluge of threats from england fans after making a controversial call against the english side in the european soccer championships last june . a paper had published his home address and phone number .
frisk was hit in the head by a flying object during a champion 's league match he refereed in september between as rome and dynamo kiev in rome .
uefa officials immediately called off the match and awarded the win to kiev .
a few months later , fans threw objects at him as he refereed a game between werder bremen and fc valencia . " his resignation is the result of the irresponsibility on the part of managers , " said volker roth , head of the german and european referees .
" they encourage the fans with their behavior .
i imagine frisk wo n't be the last to say , ' i wo n't allow myself and my family to go through that . ' " chelsea coach blamed roth took special aim at jose mourinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , chelsea 's flamboyant and controversial coach .
following the match , mourinho raised uefa 's ire by alleging that frisk consulted with fc barcelona coach frank rijkaard during halftime of the match .
the accusations were later proved to be unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose mourinho 's chelsea is leading atop the english league standings and is a favorite to win the champion 's league .
" people like mourinho are the enemy of soccer , " roth told the swedish daily aftonbladet .
he has refused to apologize for the remarks and appeared nonplussed at mourinho 's announcement that he planned to file a complaint against roth . roth appears to be getting support from other corners .
the president of the world soccer body fifa told reporters that " those who attack referees , attack soccer . " considering a strike germany 's own referee community has shown solidarity with the swede .
they have criticized the fact that refs are n't allowed at postgame press conferences to reply to coach criticism and the endless replay of controversial calls on television . " the question is whether you have to show every controversial episode over and over again in video replay , like we do in germany , and then mercilessly criticize my colleagues , " said referee eugen strigel in a newspaper interview .
" to ref a match mistake-free is impossible . " though europe 's referees have not yet threatened to go on strike , roth said it was a " legal means " to express frustration with the state of affairs . " we ca n't just stand by helplessly , " said roth in an interview with a german sports wire service .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .

in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .

the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live european journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .

in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .

after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .
the terror network operates on a need to know basis to protect the organisation 's mission and martyrs for the cause .
this is reiterated in the training manual .
" cell or cluster methods should be adopted by the organisation .
it should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another , so that if a cell member is caught the other cells would not be affected , and work would proceed normally .
the organisation should be composed of many cells whose members do not know one another . "
terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live in good shape we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

terrorism experts believe that the al qaeda network supports muslim fighters in afghanistan , bosnia , chechnya , tajikistan , somalia , yemen , and kosovo .
it also trains members of terrorist organisations from such diverse countries as the philippines , algeria , and eritrea .
all in all , the organisation is thought to operate in 40 to 50 countries , not only in the middle east and asia but in north america and europe .
in western europe there have been known or suspected cells in london , hamburg , milan and madrid .
these have been important centres for recruitment , fundraising and planning operations .
al qaeda 's expansive network was evidenced in september 11 , 2001 in organised plane attacks on new york and washington .
later that year , the united states launched a campaign to topple the taliban regime in afghanistan .
u.s. authorities believed that the taliban were harbouring bin laden who was the main suspect behind the 9/11 attacks .
however , rather than destroying the al qaeda network , the us war in afghanistan has dispersed the organisation and driven it underground .
analysts wonder about what al qaeda is .
is the organisation an actual network with osama bin laden at the helm or is it the name for a philosophical way of thinking which brings together like-minded groups .
support for this theory comes from experts who point out that many senior leaders in the organisation are also senior leaders in other terrorist organisations , including those designated by the us as foreign terrorist organisations .
analysts suggest that the word al-qaeda is now used to refer to a variety of groups connected by little more than shared ideals or aims .
this is evidenced by the series of attacks by al qaeda or groups affiliated with the terror network after 9/11 .
post 9/11 atrocities in october 2002 , a bomb exploded in a bali nightclub killing 202 people , many of them westerners .
islamic group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- is blamed for the blasts .
in kenya , two attacks were launched against israeli targets in mombasa . a hotel blast had killed 16 - including the three suicide bombers - and an israeli plane narrowly missed a missile fired towards it .
a message on a website purporting to come from al-qaeda had claimed responsibility for the attack .
in may 2003 , in morocco , casablanca was hit by a series of suicide bombings that killed 41 people , including 12 attackers .
moroccan authorities said the attacks were linked to " international terror " .
four men were convicted and sentenced to death in september for the attacks and moroccon authorities said the men were members of the salafia jihadia which is widely believed to be linked to al-qaeda .
in saudi arabia , also in may 2003 , at least 34 people were killed in a series of bomb attacks in the capital riyadh .
the attacks were carried out against luxury compounds housing foreign nationals and the offices of a us-saudi company .
the us and saudi governments pointed the finger at al-qaeda .
in indonesia , twelve people died in a bomb attack at the us-run marriot hotel in the capital jakarta in august 2003 .
the southeast asian terror network , jemaah islamiah was blamed for the attack .
authorities said that jemaah islamiah members had trained with members of al qaeda in pakistan and afghanistan .
in november 2003 , us and saudi official said that a bomb attack on a housing complex in riyadh had all the hallmarks of al-qaeda .
seventeen people were killed and more than 100 , mostly foreign arab workers were injured in the blast .
in turkey , at least 23 people were killed and more than 300 injured in two devastating attacks on synagogues in istanbul also in november 2003 .
a week after that blast , 27 people died and more than 450 were injured in co-ordinated attacks on the british consulate and the hsbc bank offices in istanbul .
there were separate claims of responsibility from two groups allegedly connected to al-qaeda .
it is difficult to ascertain whether any of these attacks were in any way planned , financed or organised by osama bin laden himself of the organisation he leads .
leader osama bin laden - a man with a deadly mission bin laden was born in saudi arabia in 1957 to a wealthy yemeni father and a syrian mother .
the al qaeda fugitive became a millionaire after making his fortune from the construction business .
at school and university he was a member of the muslim brotherhood and when the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 , he went to pakistan , where he met afghan rebel leaders or mujahideen resisting the occupation .
later he returned to saudi arabia to recruit young muslims to fight with the mujahideen , to raise funds and collect supplies .
he eventually joined in the fight against the soviets .
the afghan jihad against the soviet army was backed by american dollars and had the blessing of the governments of saudi arabia and pakistan .
after the soviet withdrawal , the " arab afghans " , as bin laden 's faction came to be known returned to saudi arabia .
bin laden had offered the saudi government to provide an army of mujahideen to defend the kingdom after the iraqi invasion of kuwait .
however this offer was turned down and the saudi government invited instead half a million us soldiers to defend the kingdom .
this angered bin laden who then became an opponent of the saudi regime .
he began to target us and its allies in the middle east .
in 1991 , he was expelled from the country because of his anti-government activities .
he spent the next five years in sudan , where he used his money to fund a number of infrastructure projects for the islamist government in khartoum .
the us put pressure on sudan 's government to expel him , prompting bin laden 's return to afghanistan where he became increasingly messianic and radical .
by the mid-1990s , he was calling for a global war against americans and jews .
from his perspective the world trade centre in new york and the pentagon in washington were ideal targets because they symbolised everything he has declared war on . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live quadriga we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

al qaeda - the hydra of international terrorism al qaeda - the organisation al qaeda , meaning " the base " was created in 1989 as soviet forces withdrew from afghanistan .
the organisation grew out of the network of arab volunteers who had gone to afghanistan to fight under the banner of islam against soviet communism .
in the early 1990s al qaeda operated in sudan and after 1996 its headquarters and about a dozen training camps moved to afghanistan , where bin laden forged a close relationship with the taliban .
al qaeda 's main mission is the " overthrow of godless regimes and their replacements with an islamic regime . "
this is further explained by the al qaeda training manual which was discovered during a series of police raids in the united kingdom between 2001 and 2002 .
" the confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know socratic debates ... , platonic ideals ... , nor aristotelian diplomacy .
but it knows the dialogue of bullets , the ideals of assassination , bombing , and destruction , and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine-gun . islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and co-operative councils .
they are established as they -lsb- always -rsb- have been by pen and gun , by word and bullet , by tongue and teeth " this aim is made more specific by osama bin laden who says the objective is to " launch a guerrilla war against american forces and expel the infidels from the arabian peninsula " .

so why does child neglect still happen , and what can be done to prevent it ? jessica spent her short life in a tiny , unheated backroom of a top-floor apartment , where the windows were kept permanently shut and covered with black plastic .
when she died , she weighed just 9.5 kilos -lrb- 20.9 lbs -rrb- .
the autopsy showed she 'd been eating carpet fluff and her own hair to quell her hunger pangs .
her mother , 35-year-old marlies s. , only called an ambulance when jessica went into a coma . " her last few weeks alive must have been hell , " said a police officer . neighbors and social services were unaware of the child 's existence .
when she had failed to attend school at the age of five , hamburg 's education authority sent an official to the apartment where jessica was registered .
after three attempts to establish contact , the authority decided the family must have moved and gave up . she is n't the only child in germany to have met a painful death at the hands of indifferent parents .
in the past five years , at least eight children have died under similar circumstances . according to the berlin criminal office , an average of 200 cases of suspected child neglect per year are reported to the police in the capital alone . changing sensibilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ekin deligöz " a lot of cuts are being made to the social services , but , at the same time , their cases are piling up , " ekin deligöz -lrb- photo -rrb- of the green party said .
she heads the bundestag 's child commission and oversees the government 's recently unveiled " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany . "
" one reason for the increase is that there 's been a change in attitudes and more and more people are getting referred to the youth welfare office , " deligöz explained . recent years have even seen social workers acting with excessive haste .
" youth welfare offices are regularly criticized for over-reacting , " said uta von pirani , director of berlin 's youth welfare office .
" they 're often accused of taking children out of families too quickly . "
but she says they ca n't win .
" either that , or they 're accused of acting too late or not at all , " she added . according to katharina abelmann-vollmer from the german child protection association , the number of cases of child neglect is not actually rising . " what 's changed is public sensibility .
people are more shocked about violence towards children than they used to be , and the spare-the-rod-and-spoil-the-child approach is no longer acceptable . " a side-effect of unemployment in some respects , jessica was also a victim of germany 's recent slide into mass joblessness . " germany 's widespread unemployment is taking its toll on the nation 's children , " pointed out deligöz .
" the divorce rate is climbing and we 're seeing more and more patchwork families . " " in hamburg , a child loses its right to a kindergarten place if its mother is unemployed , " she went on .
" for as long as jessica was in care , her situation was under control .
obviously , the staff would have been the first to notice anything suspicious - if she 'd shown signs of starvation , for example .
had she been able to stay there , her case would never have gone unnoticed .

europe 's referees say enough is enough and are considering striking . for a period of two weeks , referee anders frisk 's life and that of his family was a living hell . death threats , in the form of phone calls and letters , arrived at his home in sweden on a daily basis .
fans of the london soccer club chelsea , angry at him for awarding a red card to one of their players in a champion 's league match against fc barcelona , would n't let up .
" those were the worst 16 days of my career , " said frisk upon stepping down .
" i would n't let my daughter open the mailbox anymore , out of fear . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after dimissing chelsea striker didier drogba -lrb- l . -rrb- with a yellow-red card in this champion 's league match in barcelona , fc barcelona used the man-advantage to turn the game and win 2-1 . roughly a year before germany gets ready to host the world cup , european soccer 's governing body uefa is without one of their top referees and facing increasing criticism that not enough is being done to protect them .
a spokesman for uefa said this week that the organization is trying to convince frisk to stay on board . frisk often the victim referee representatives say the climate is such that coaches and fans seem to think they can criticize at will . swiss ref urs meier had suffered a deluge of threats from england fans after making a controversial call against the english side in the european soccer championships last june . a paper had published his home address and phone number .
frisk was hit in the head by a flying object during a champion 's league match he refereed in september between as rome and dynamo kiev in rome .
uefa officials immediately called off the match and awarded the win to kiev .
a few months later , fans threw objects at him as he refereed a game between werder bremen and fc valencia . " his resignation is the result of the irresponsibility on the part of managers , " said volker roth , head of the german and european referees .
" they encourage the fans with their behavior .
i imagine frisk wo n't be the last to say , ' i wo n't allow myself and my family to go through that . ' " chelsea coach blamed roth took special aim at jose mourinho -lrb- photo -rrb- , chelsea 's flamboyant and controversial coach .
following the match , mourinho raised uefa 's ire by alleging that frisk consulted with fc barcelona coach frank rijkaard during halftime of the match .
the accusations were later proved to be unfounded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose mourinho 's chelsea is leading atop the english league standings and is a favorite to win the champion 's league .
" people like mourinho are the enemy of soccer , " roth told the swedish daily aftonbladet .
he has refused to apologize for the remarks and appeared nonplussed at mourinho 's announcement that he planned to file a complaint against roth . roth appears to be getting support from other corners .
the president of the world soccer body fifa told reporters that " those who attack referees , attack soccer . " considering a strike germany 's own referee community has shown solidarity with the swede .
they have criticized the fact that refs are n't allowed at postgame press conferences to reply to coach criticism and the endless replay of controversial calls on television . " the question is whether you have to show every controversial episode over and over again in video replay , like we do in germany , and then mercilessly criticize my colleagues , " said referee eugen strigel in a newspaper interview .
" to ref a match mistake-free is impossible . " though europe 's referees have not yet threatened to go on strike , roth said it was a " legal means " to express frustration with the state of affairs . " we ca n't just stand by helplessly , " said roth in an interview with a german sports wire service .

the firm says the plan means improved environmental treatments and cleaner sea water off the sussex coast .
but surfer groups claim it offers secondary , not full , water treatment and water could contain faecal bugs .
on thursday the firm will apply to both east sussex county council and brighton city council for planning permission .
pumping stations the plan also includes a 11km -lrb- 6.8 miles -rrb- long underground sewer between black rock and peacehaven , to transfer waste water to the new works .
underground pumping stations and underground shafts will also be built in brighton .
the company , which says the new scheme is needed to meet eu directives , plans to hold a public exhibition to update local residents on its proposals .
but some peacehaven residents are angry at the plans and claim the area is being used to deal with brighton and hove 's sewage .
they fear it will smell and blight the countryside but the water firm says foul air will be extracted and the plant will have environmental benefits .
earlier in march richard gregory , of surfers against sewage , said : " both councils should adopt a policy that best reflects the needs of local people , the environment and recreational water users and that 's full sewage treatment , not secondary . "

dixie tilley , from haverfordwest in pembrokeshire , was cycling along roads near the town when he saw what looked like a black panther .
he said he got within 40 yards of the animal and got a good look at it before it disappeared under a fence .
in the past , the welsh assembly government has investigated sightings .
mr tilley told bbc radio wales he was cycling along a bike track when he saw the animal coming towards him .
" i though , oh that 's a big dog .
i was cycling quite quietly , then it saw me and went under the fence .
it sort of loped across the field and i thought , that 's not a dog , " he said .
" i could see by the shape of its tail .
we 've got a cat at home and it 's just like it , only this is 20 , 30 times bigger .
but it seemed to cover lots of ground , then it sort of disappeared . "
' shiny ' he saw some people a few minutes later and mentioned it to them .
they told him there had been one spotted about a year earlier in the area .
" it was jet black and it was really , really shiny .
it was bigger than an alsatian but longer .
" if you see a cat , their back is flat and their head is low .
a dog is more upright and a tail is swishing .
" i do n't know much about them really .
i 've seen these stories in the paper and i 've always taken it with a pinch of salt really , but having seen it , it 's wonderful .
" it was out of the blue - a minute , minute and a half and it was gone .
it would be nice to see it again . "
this video captured a ' big cat ' on camera in september , a family captured a black cat-like creature on film creeping through undergrowth near welshpool .
a welsh assembly government investigation concluded that the animal was just a domestic pet , but big cat experts were keeping an open mind .
fears of wild big cats such as pumas and panthers roaming mid and west wales have circulated since the 1970s , including sightings of the so-called " beast of bont " in north ceredigion .
a expert was called in to investigate a suspected big cat attack on a welsh lamb at talsarn , near lampeter .
officials also spent time investigating an alleged attack at a farm in llangadog , carmarthenshire , in january 2003 , after a dog was killed .
however , in that case , tests showed the attacker was another dog , although the breed could not be established .

the sisters of murdered belfast man robert mccartney have visited the us in a bid to dispel any " romantic vision " that americans may have of the ira 's struggle .
meanwhile , sinn fein 's gerry adams has received a frosty response from politicians during his visit .
reporters ' log : ireland row in washington march 17 kevin connolly : washington : 0200gmt later today , in what will be an extraordinarily powerful and symbolic moment , the mccartney sisters and robert mccartney 's partner , bridgeen hagans , will go to the white house reception .
there they will meet president george bush and hand him a dossier explaining the circumstances surrounding robert 's killing .
that will be , if you like , the crowning moment of their campaign .
the mccartney sisters seem to have attracted the support of the entire washington establishment , partly because of the dignity in their bereavement .
but it 's also because they 've succeeding in crystallising a lot of questions about what was going on in the peace process and about the role of armed republicanism now .
there were a lot of doubts which had begun to play in the minds of irish americans .
the mccartney sisters have succeeded in giving voice to some of those doubts , if you like , and refocusing the whole debate about why the peace process had lost momentum .
mark simpson : washington : 2030gmt i 've just been speaking to gerry adams within 30 minutes of ted kennedy saying that the ira was the albatross hanging around gerry adams ' neck .
he would n't respond directly to the question but his whole language , his body language was somewhat defiant .
he knows he 's a man under political pressure .
i do n't know if he is in denial , but he is certainly showing no signs of anyone who is backing down from anything that he has said and done in recent times .
no doubt about it in political terms , this has not been a good week for gerry adams .
matt frei : washington : 2000gmt they have barely had enough time to grieve for their brother , and their first trip to the us involves meetings on capitol hill and in the oval office .
senator ted kennedy , a giant in the irish-american community , met with them instead of gerry adams .
after an hour behind closed doors , a press conference was held with some of the biggest names in both parties .
and the call to sinn fein that underlines just how much the death of robert mccartney is already changing a much bigger picture .
" no political party can also have an armed unit that continues the violence and criminality in today 's world , " senator kennedy said .
us northern ireland envoy mitchell reiss has met with the sisters over at the west wing at the white house it was left to the president to explain how the sister 's crusade for justice has captured imaginations from belfast to washington .
" i 'm looking forward to meeting these very brave souls , they 've committed themselves to a peaceful solution , and hopefully their loved one will not have died in vain , " mr bush said .
sinn fein 's gerry adams said : " this is a process and you do n't bring about the historic changes we 're involved with overnight or at the flick of a switch . "
mark simpson : washington : 1930gmt the statement by senator kennedy was not just symbolism , although the symbolism was huge .
it was like a who 's who of irish america there standing literally shoulder to shoulder with the mccartney sisters .
but there was some real substance there .
we have seen the actions by ted kennedy refusing to meet gerry adams .
here we saw the words as well .
ted kennedy saying that sinn fein is at an historic crossroads , and that the ira has become an albatross around their neck .
in typical american-speak , he sent the message out loud and clear to gerry adams as to what he must do with the ira .
it is not a case of holding them but folding them .
another point worth making is that people are talking about these mccartney sisters as being amateurs and naïve .
but catherine mccartney spoke there without notes staring down the barrel of the camera .
she was eloquent as anyone else there in the room .
no doubt about it .
this family knows what they are doing .
they are more than capable of holding their own .
people have been asking who are pulling their strings , but when you see that performance by catherine mccartney there , you wonder if it is the family pulling their own strings .
mark devenport : washington : 1715gmt the us administration has decided to open its doors to the mccartney sisters , who are really symbols of everything they think is wrong with the republican approach to the peace process .
mitchell reiss for some time has been putting pressure on republicans to sort out their approach to policing and justice in northern ireland , to buy into the new police service and really for the ira to go out of business .
there has been growing frustration on the part of mitchell reiss and the administration in general about the failure of the ira , so far as they see it , to come up the mark there .
the mccartney sisters want to dispel romantic notions about the ira the sisters have campaigned on the basis their search for justice has being frustrated because of what they see as elements of the ira operating as a criminal gang .
that is much in tune with the agendas of washington , london and dublin that the sisters are very much knocking on an open door .
the envoy has issued a general statement of support .
but symbols can be important in northern ireland .
the fact that we 're seeing gerry adams , and indeed the other political leaders on the outside and the sisters on the inside , is going to be a very potent message back at home .
the $ 64,000 question as far as the sisters are concerned is while they might be achieving , by any standards , incredible political results will they actually be able to achieve their campaign for justice ?
that will really depend not on what happens here in washington but attitudes on the ground in the short strand where getting people to provide evidence , getting witnesses to stand up in court is an uphill struggle .
mark simpson : washington : 1630gmt this is all about pressure for these sisters .
as we know , when their brother was killed almost two months ago they got local support from within their own hardline republican community in belfast .
that then became national support in northern ireland .
then they got support from london .
then they got support from dublin .
now they have support from washington and the most powerful politician in the world .
i think what they are hoping , desperately hoping , is that the combination of all this pressure will somehow persuade the killers of their brother in belfast to give themselves up .
is that likely to happen ?
probably not .
but the sisters are so desperate .
they think it 's worth a try .
their message has got progressively more political throughout the last two months .
it started with an innocent cry for help .
" our brother has been killed .
whoever it was has to give themselves in . "
now it has become a hardcore political message .
for instance , catherine mccartney saying at the baltimore-washington airport last night : " we 're here to dispel myths about the republican movement about the ira .
" we 're here to show them for what they really are . "
that is a very political message rather than simply a family message .

the sisters of murdered belfast man robert mccartney have visited the us in a bid to dispel any " romantic vision " that americans may have of the ira 's struggle .
meanwhile , sinn fein 's gerry adams has received a frosty response from politicians during his visit .
reporters ' log : ireland row in washington march 17 kevin connolly : washington : 0200gmt later today , in what will be an extraordinarily powerful and symbolic moment , the mccartney sisters and robert mccartney 's partner , bridgeen hagans , will go to the white house reception .
there they will meet president george bush and hand him a dossier explaining the circumstances surrounding robert 's killing .
that will be , if you like , the crowning moment of their campaign .
the mccartney sisters seem to have attracted the support of the entire washington establishment , partly because of the dignity in their bereavement .
but it 's also because they 've succeeding in crystallising a lot of questions about what was going on in the peace process and about the role of armed republicanism now .
there were a lot of doubts which had begun to play in the minds of irish americans .
the mccartney sisters have succeeded in giving voice to some of those doubts , if you like , and refocusing the whole debate about why the peace process had lost momentum .
mark simpson : washington : 2030gmt i 've just been speaking to gerry adams within 30 minutes of ted kennedy saying that the ira was the albatross hanging around gerry adams ' neck .
he would n't respond directly to the question but his whole language , his body language was somewhat defiant .
he knows he 's a man under political pressure .
i do n't know if he is in denial , but he is certainly showing no signs of anyone who is backing down from anything that he has said and done in recent times .
no doubt about it in political terms , this has not been a good week for gerry adams .
matt frei : washington : 2000gmt they have barely had enough time to grieve for their brother , and their first trip to the us involves meetings on capitol hill and in the oval office .
senator ted kennedy , a giant in the irish-american community , met with them instead of gerry adams .
after an hour behind closed doors , a press conference was held with some of the biggest names in both parties .
and the call to sinn fein that underlines just how much the death of robert mccartney is already changing a much bigger picture .
" no political party can also have an armed unit that continues the violence and criminality in today 's world , " senator kennedy said .
us northern ireland envoy mitchell reiss has met with the sisters over at the west wing at the white house it was left to the president to explain how the sister 's crusade for justice has captured imaginations from belfast to washington .
" i 'm looking forward to meeting these very brave souls , they 've committed themselves to a peaceful solution , and hopefully their loved one will not have died in vain , " mr bush said .
sinn fein 's gerry adams said : " this is a process and you do n't bring about the historic changes we 're involved with overnight or at the flick of a switch . "
mark simpson : washington : 1930gmt the statement by senator kennedy was not just symbolism , although the symbolism was huge .
it was like a who 's who of irish america there standing literally shoulder to shoulder with the mccartney sisters .
but there was some real substance there .
we have seen the actions by ted kennedy refusing to meet gerry adams .
here we saw the words as well .
ted kennedy saying that sinn fein is at an historic crossroads , and that the ira has become an albatross around their neck .
in typical american-speak , he sent the message out loud and clear to gerry adams as to what he must do with the ira .
it is not a case of holding them but folding them .
another point worth making is that people are talking about these mccartney sisters as being amateurs and naïve .
but catherine mccartney spoke there without notes staring down the barrel of the camera .
she was eloquent as anyone else there in the room .
no doubt about it .
this family knows what they are doing .
they are more than capable of holding their own .
people have been asking who are pulling their strings , but when you see that performance by catherine mccartney there , you wonder if it is the family pulling their own strings .
mark devenport : washington : 1715gmt the us administration has decided to open its doors to the mccartney sisters , who are really symbols of everything they think is wrong with the republican approach to the peace process .
mitchell reiss for some time has been putting pressure on republicans to sort out their approach to policing and justice in northern ireland , to buy into the new police service and really for the ira to go out of business .
there has been growing frustration on the part of mitchell reiss and the administration in general about the failure of the ira , so far as they see it , to come up the mark there .
the mccartney sisters want to dispel romantic notions about the ira the sisters have campaigned on the basis their search for justice has being frustrated because of what they see as elements of the ira operating as a criminal gang .
that is much in tune with the agendas of washington , london and dublin that the sisters are very much knocking on an open door .
the envoy has issued a general statement of support .
but symbols can be important in northern ireland .
the fact that we 're seeing gerry adams , and indeed the other political leaders on the outside and the sisters on the inside , is going to be a very potent message back at home .
the $ 64,000 question as far as the sisters are concerned is while they might be achieving , by any standards , incredible political results will they actually be able to achieve their campaign for justice ?
that will really depend not on what happens here in washington but attitudes on the ground in the short strand where getting people to provide evidence , getting witnesses to stand up in court is an uphill struggle .
mark simpson : washington : 1630gmt this is all about pressure for these sisters .
as we know , when their brother was killed almost two months ago they got local support from within their own hardline republican community in belfast .
that then became national support in northern ireland .
then they got support from london .
then they got support from dublin .
now they have support from washington and the most powerful politician in the world .
i think what they are hoping , desperately hoping , is that the combination of all this pressure will somehow persuade the killers of their brother in belfast to give themselves up .
is that likely to happen ?
probably not .
but the sisters are so desperate .
they think it 's worth a try .
their message has got progressively more political throughout the last two months .
it started with an innocent cry for help .
" our brother has been killed .
whoever it was has to give themselves in . "
now it has become a hardcore political message .
for instance , catherine mccartney saying at the baltimore-washington airport last night : " we 're here to dispel myths about the republican movement about the ira .
" we 're here to show them for what they really are . "
that is a very political message rather than simply a family message .

councillors took eight hours to decide on the scheme which will see land at heslington east developed to increase student intake .

jobs created the authority has acknowledged the expansion would result in some negative impacts but says they are outweighed by the positive effect it would have on the local economy .
york is one of the smallest universities in england and says it needs to expand to maintain its position as one of the country 's most-respected .
the university aims to introduce new courses and the development would also create 2,000 university jobs and a further 2,500 related jobs across the city .

ripudaman singh malik , a wealthy vancouver businessman , and ajaib singh bagri , a mill worker from the interior of british columbia , were charged with a number of offences including first-degree murder .
it was not the result victims ' relatives had been expecting or hoping for .
many wept in the courtroom as the verdicts were announced , shaking their heads and leaning on one another .
one man quietly sobbed " what a travesty " .
after the verdict a succession of victims ' relatives expressed their shock , disappointment and anger .
one called the decision a victory for terrorism , another said he felt as though he had suffered a second tragedy .
" there are now two crimes we must deal with , " said susheel gupta , whose mother was killed in the crash .
" the murder of 329 innocent persons , and the time it has taken to answer the questions of how and why . "
sandhu samra , president of the guru nanak sikh temple near vancouver , said he was " shocked and astonished " by the verdict . "
this is a day of mourning for all of canada " eddie madon victim 's relative " many in the community are now asking ' if not these men then who ? ' , " he told journalists after the verdict .
the ex-defendants , who were both born in india , denied any involvement in the crime .
" i want to repeat publicly today what i have told the authorities numerous times since 1985 , that i had absolutely no involvement in any of these criminal activities , " mr bagri said in a statement after the court verdict .
' shocked ' eddie madon lost his father to the bombing .
" this is a day of mourning for all of canada , " he said .
rattan kalsi , who travelled to vancouver from eastern canada to hear the verdict , also said he was disappointed with the result .
but he says he is confident whoever bombed the plane will get justice before god .
" i 'm shocked , " added david hayer , a provincial politician in british columbia .
his father was a sikh newspaper publisher in vancouver and was scheduled to testify in this case .
but he was murdered in 1998 .
even after the decision , few in vancouver 's sikh community seem comfortable speaking publicly about this case - something that police say hampered their investigation all along .
but in an interview with the canadian broadcasting corporation , a spokesman for the sikh khalsa diwan society , sarwan singh randhawa , said he was surprised by the result .
" there is no answer for the victims who lost their lives and now answer for the canadian people , " he said .
surveillance recordings in a statement , ajit singh sahota , president of the world sikh organisation of canada , said his group had hoped the court decision " would begin the healing process for so many canadians who have suffered from this tragedy " .
and from both the sikh community and the victims ' relatives there are growing calls for an independent inquiry into what went wrong with the investigation , and the failure to convict anyone for the crime after 20 years .
during the trial , the court heard that the canadian intelligence service erased surveillance recordings of the accused .
and while agents were keeping close track of several of the main suspects at the time , they happened not to be following them on the day the bomb was put on the plane .
given those apparent lapses , eddie madon says an inquiry is an absolute necessity .
" the prime minister , if he has any integrity at all , must call a public inquiry . "
" they owe it to us .
they owe it to the victims of this crime . "
stephen harper , leader of canada 's parliamentary opposition , also says he believes it essential that the government call the inquiry .
" i 'm not in a position to hand down a verdict , " he said in ottawa .
" i ca n't challenge the verdict .
i can simply say that because more than 300 canadians are dead , justice has not been done . "

the a595 parton to lillyhall is narrow and winding with many junctions , which cause heavy congestion for the more than 17,000 vehicles a day that use it .
a three-day public exhibition of the plans starts on thursday at distington community centre .
the highways agency says the route has been designed to fit in with its surroundings and minimise impact .
the route includes a rural valley , two nearby ancient monuments at hayes castle and moresby hall , along with listed buildings and historic sites and monuments .
new bypass highways agency project manager iolo williams said : " the lack of a high-quality access route to west cumbria is a restraint to economic growth in the region .
" improving the route will improve journey times and safety and is good news for drivers in west cumbria . "
the proposed rote is just over 5km from the a596 junction at lillyhall .
the a598 junction at lillyhall will be brought up to dual carriageway standard to the junction with the a597 .
a new bypass will be built to the west , bypassing the villages of distington , common end and howgate before rejoining the a595 at parton .
