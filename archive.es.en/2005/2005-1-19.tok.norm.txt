program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2005 politicians worried about us ' iran stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions are prompting concerns german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .
many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .

people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .

" we have to move away from just providing information , we have to change our behaviour , " timo harfst said . he welcomes the introduction of a prevention law which is due to be passed this spring , and sees it as an opportunity to teach germans that factors such as stress , lack of physical exercise , too much television and inadequate social activity can all lead to some form of depression .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .
and there are no rumours of a slump in business . in keeping with the generosity of the german health service , those who stump up their monthly fee can take their psychological problems - be they phobias or depression - to a therapist of their choice at no additional cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychotherapy is an underpraised solution compared to the palette of opportunities in countries like britain and the us , it 's a great deal .
but then again , there are other comparisons which show that germany is less advanced in terms of shaking off the old taboos and stigmas attached to opting to talk through problems with a professional . ongoing taboo " it 's still not easy in germany .
people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .
but as the government gradually chips away at the welfare state , there is less money available to ease their plight . " these days people have other problems . they 're worrying about hartz iv -lrb- the latest slew of labor reforms -rrb- and unemployment rather than about the disabled or those with psychological problems , " klaus leonhard , manager of lankwitz disabled workshop said . recha drews believes that although patients in germany have relatively easy access to therapy , the system no longer provides those who have had to give up their jobs , with the necessary support for a return to regularity .
" what we are seeing now is a system in which people with psychological problems are told to go to workshops for disabled people , and that 's pretty much the last stop , " drews said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group therapy is another option and although there are a number of small workshop initiatives which promote reintegration and rehabilitation , klaus leonhard says that of the people who enter such protected working environments , no more than 20 percent of them make it back out into the free labor market . prevention is better than a cure in view of such statistics , at least part of the solution has to lie in preventative measures .
" we have to move away from just providing information , we have to change our behaviour , " timo harfst said . he welcomes the introduction of a prevention law which is due to be passed this spring , and sees it as an opportunity to teach germans that factors such as stress , lack of physical exercise , too much television and inadequate social activity can all lead to some form of depression .

13 , 2005 after palestinian militants set off a large bomb asselborn 's visit comes at a time of rising tensions in the conflict-riddled region .
on tuesday , a suicide bomber killed an agent of israel 's shin bet security service and wounded seven other israelis at an army checkpoint in gaza .
it follows another attack after the palestinian polls on jan .
9 that left more than ten dead on either side , leading sharon to severe ties with abbas for failing to rein in palestinian militants . despite the setback , asselborn is optimistic that peace still stands a chance in the middle east .
in an interview with dw-world shortly before his visit , he said he hoped the recent attacks " were only a flame that can be quickly wiped out . " asselborn also stressed he would make clear in talks with leaders in the region that the eu 's prime goal was to ensure the israelis and palestinians get back to the negotiating table .
" both sides must once again talk about the road map so that the goal - of a two-state solution where both people coexist in peace - can be achieved . " stronger role for eu experts agree that the eu will attempt to live up to its promises in the middle east and pursue the goal of setting up an independent palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana , left during a tour in the northern gaza strip town of beit lahiya , mirjam dittrich of the european policy center in brussels , who maps political trends in the middle east , said the eu would try to implement as soon as possible the four-point plan drawn by up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief last november . that would mean aiding reforms to the palestinian police force , organizing local elections and supporting economic development in the occupied territories .
" the eu wants to play a stronger and more active role in the mideast peace process , " dittrich said . for more than a decade , the eu has been attempting to sustain the peace process with massive cash injections in the region . in 2002 and 2003 , the eu released half a billion euro for refugee-aid , institution-building and legal reforms .
an additional € 88 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- were spent between 1995 and 2003 via the initiative " middle east peace process projects " with the aim of propping up economic and social structures of civil society . the eu remains the largest foreign donor for the palestinian government .
the election observation commission that the eu sent to the region for the presidential elections on jan .
9 was the biggest of its kind in its history . engaging with the us europe 's new-found enthusiasm for engaging more closely with the middle east process has also led to misgivings that the eu might be seeking to profile itself as a prime peacemaker by edging the us out of the main mediatory role .
in dec .
2004 , for instance , sharon warned the eu to stop interfering directly in the political process in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas but , asselborn stressed that the eu 's peace role in the middle east did n't stop at financially supporting reforms and development in the region , but crucially , also persuading washington to work more constructively with new palestinian president abbas than with yasser arafat , who died in november . " it 's especially necessary , particularly at this time , that we do n't just look at europe in the transatlantic relationship , but rather tell the americans that if they want to counter terror in the world , then a cornerstone of that fight must be a new relationship between israel and palestine , " asselborn said . he added that the us had to deepen its engagement in the middle east during president bush 's second term if peace was to be given a chance .
" that 's only possible if america invests much more in the mideast peace process than it has in the past few months or years .
we need to make that clear to the americans , " he said . speaking unitedly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder asselborn 's views were echoed by german chancellor gerhard schröder this week .
the chancellor told reporters before a visit by u.s. president george w. bush to germany next month that abbas had shown his commitment to fighting terrorism . " this is a clear signal that he has to be taken seriously .
we would welcome more progress -lrb- towards peace -rrb- but this will only happen if the united states plays a stronger role than before , if it adopts a more dynamic approach . " asselborn also underlined that the only way for the eu to persuade the us to take on a stronger role in the peace process was if the 25-member bloc spoke with one voice . " i hope that we -lrb- the 25 eu members -rrb- can remain united and convince the americans through our combined weight , " he said .
" we need to get away from the stereotype reaction that the americans are on the side of the israelis and the europeans on the palestinians .

it follows another attack after the palestinian polls on jan .
9 that left more than ten dead on either side , leading sharon to severe ties with abbas for failing to rein in palestinian militants . despite the setback , asselborn is optimistic that peace still stands a chance in the middle east .
in an interview with dw-world shortly before his visit , he said he hoped the recent attacks " were only a flame that can be quickly wiped out . " asselborn also stressed he would make clear in talks with leaders in the region that the eu 's prime goal was to ensure the israelis and palestinians get back to the negotiating table .
" both sides must once again talk about the road map so that the goal - of a two-state solution where both people coexist in peace - can be achieved .

" the eu wants to play a stronger and more active role in the mideast peace process , " dittrich said . for more than a decade , the eu has been attempting to sustain the peace process with massive cash injections in the region . in 2002 and 2003 , the eu released half a billion euro for refugee-aid , institution-building and legal reforms .
an additional € 88 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- were spent between 1995 and 2003 via the initiative " middle east peace process projects " with the aim of propping up economic and social structures of civil society . the eu remains the largest foreign donor for the palestinian government .

" it 's especially necessary , particularly at this time , that we do n't just look at europe in the transatlantic relationship , but rather tell the americans that if they want to counter terror in the world , then a cornerstone of that fight must be a new relationship between israel and palestine , " asselborn said . he added that the us had to deepen its engagement in the middle east during president bush 's second term if peace was to be given a chance .
" that 's only possible if america invests much more in the mideast peace process than it has in the past few months or years .
we need to make that clear to the americans , " he said . speaking unitedly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder asselborn 's views were echoed by german chancellor gerhard schröder this week .

13 , 2005 after palestinian militants set off a large bomb asselborn 's visit comes at a time of rising tensions in the conflict-riddled region .
on tuesday , a suicide bomber killed an agent of israel 's shin bet security service and wounded seven other israelis at an army checkpoint in gaza .
it follows another attack after the palestinian polls on jan .
9 that left more than ten dead on either side , leading sharon to severe ties with abbas for failing to rein in palestinian militants . despite the setback , asselborn is optimistic that peace still stands a chance in the middle east .
in an interview with dw-world shortly before his visit , he said he hoped the recent attacks " were only a flame that can be quickly wiped out . " asselborn also stressed he would make clear in talks with leaders in the region that the eu 's prime goal was to ensure the israelis and palestinians get back to the negotiating table .
" both sides must once again talk about the road map so that the goal - of a two-state solution where both people coexist in peace - can be achieved . " stronger role for eu experts agree that the eu will attempt to live up to its promises in the middle east and pursue the goal of setting up an independent palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana , left during a tour in the northern gaza strip town of beit lahiya , mirjam dittrich of the european policy center in brussels , who maps political trends in the middle east , said the eu would try to implement as soon as possible the four-point plan drawn by up by javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief last november . that would mean aiding reforms to the palestinian police force , organizing local elections and supporting economic development in the occupied territories .
" the eu wants to play a stronger and more active role in the mideast peace process , " dittrich said . for more than a decade , the eu has been attempting to sustain the peace process with massive cash injections in the region . in 2002 and 2003 , the eu released half a billion euro for refugee-aid , institution-building and legal reforms .
an additional € 88 million -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- were spent between 1995 and 2003 via the initiative " middle east peace process projects " with the aim of propping up economic and social structures of civil society . the eu remains the largest foreign donor for the palestinian government .
the election observation commission that the eu sent to the region for the presidential elections on jan .
9 was the biggest of its kind in its history . engaging with the us europe 's new-found enthusiasm for engaging more closely with the middle east process has also led to misgivings that the eu might be seeking to profile itself as a prime peacemaker by edging the us out of the main mediatory role .
in dec .
2004 , for instance , sharon warned the eu to stop interfering directly in the political process in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas but , asselborn stressed that the eu 's peace role in the middle east did n't stop at financially supporting reforms and development in the region , but crucially , also persuading washington to work more constructively with new palestinian president abbas than with yasser arafat , who died in november . " it 's especially necessary , particularly at this time , that we do n't just look at europe in the transatlantic relationship , but rather tell the americans that if they want to counter terror in the world , then a cornerstone of that fight must be a new relationship between israel and palestine , " asselborn said . he added that the us had to deepen its engagement in the middle east during president bush 's second term if peace was to be given a chance .
" that 's only possible if america invests much more in the mideast peace process than it has in the past few months or years .
we need to make that clear to the americans , " he said . speaking unitedly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder asselborn 's views were echoed by german chancellor gerhard schröder this week .
the chancellor told reporters before a visit by u.s. president george w. bush to germany next month that abbas had shown his commitment to fighting terrorism . " this is a clear signal that he has to be taken seriously .
we would welcome more progress -lrb- towards peace -rrb- but this will only happen if the united states plays a stronger role than before , if it adopts a more dynamic approach . " asselborn also underlined that the only way for the eu to persuade the us to take on a stronger role in the peace process was if the 25-member bloc spoke with one voice . " i hope that we -lrb- the 25 eu members -rrb- can remain united and convince the americans through our combined weight , " he said .
" we need to get away from the stereotype reaction that the americans are on the side of the israelis and the europeans on the palestinians .
that really has to change .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.01.2005 airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus , boeing not in the mood for celebrating at the moment a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .
eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.01.2005 airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus , boeing not in the mood for celebrating at the moment a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .
eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2005 politicians worried about us ' iran stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions are prompting concerns german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .
many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .
his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

olivier louis , a technical expert from the eu 's anti-fraud office , told a news conference that 50 euro cent coins were even faked for use in developing countries .
however , the number of fake coins is still minuscule compared to the 55 billion genuine coins in circulation .
germany 's vdai vending machine industry group said more than twice as many counterfeit euro coins were now being found as counterfeit pfennig and deutschmark coins previously and suggested the eu might want to reconsider its policy allowing national designs on one side of the coins .
christian trenner , head of the vdai , noted there were already 120 different euro coins in the 12 euro zone nations and this could climb to 300 in the next 10 years as the eu 's 10 new member states join the common currency area . dw-world.de top cops meet in bulgaria to combat counterfeiting experts from 12 european countries and europol , europe 's police agency , are gathering this week in bulgaria to combat currency counterfeiting , which investigators have described as a major threat to europe 's economy .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

olivier louis , a technical expert from the eu 's anti-fraud office , told a news conference that 50 euro cent coins were even faked for use in developing countries .
however , the number of fake coins is still minuscule compared to the 55 billion genuine coins in circulation .
germany 's vdai vending machine industry group said more than twice as many counterfeit euro coins were now being found as counterfeit pfennig and deutschmark coins previously and suggested the eu might want to reconsider its policy allowing national designs on one side of the coins .
christian trenner , head of the vdai , noted there were already 120 different euro coins in the 12 euro zone nations and this could climb to 300 in the next 10 years as the eu 's 10 new member states join the common currency area . dw-world.de top cops meet in bulgaria to combat counterfeiting experts from 12 european countries and europol , europe 's police agency , are gathering this week in bulgaria to combat currency counterfeiting , which investigators have described as a major threat to europe 's economy .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .

but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .
but it is n't easy : iran is still suspected of developing nuclear weapons .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .

government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

thousands of spectators will turn out to watch some 150 teams try to beat each other over the finish line - weather permitting . think dogsled racing only takes place in alaska ?
think again .
if enough snow is on the ground then , the international federation of sleddog sports will host an international competition from jan .
28 to jan .
30 , in the winter sports resort town of todtmoos , in germany 's black forest .
some 150 of the world 's top mushers - as dogsled drivers are officially known - and their canine charges will descend on the picturesque village near freiburg , in southern baden-württemburg .
growing popularity the first dogsled races in germany took place in the hessian town of bad sooden-allendorf in 1973 .
only 16 mushers and their sleds raced the course .
the handful of onlookers shouted mostly jibes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iditarod , from anchorage to nome , alaska , is the worlds best known dog sledding race since 1975 , todtmoos has hosted the race , and the number of onlookers and fans has risen steadily .
by the time todtmoos hosted the world cup races in 1994 - the first held in europe - the raced was watched by 40,000 enthusiastic spectators .
barking , but not mad with snow-draped evergreens lining the course and amid the aroma of spiced mulled glühwein , attendees at the todtmoos race get to experience dog sledding with that fairytale touch .
but forget spending a " silent night " in the quiet snow .
with 1,000 dogs of various breeds in residence during the races , visitors to todtmoos had better be prepared to put up with howling and yipping .
most of the racing dogs are huskies , but other breeds also participate .
a one-day ticket to the races in todtmoos costs € 6 -lrb- $ 7.80 -rrb- , while a combination ticket to all events costs € 10 per person .
there is also a cultural program to round out the event , including torchlight hikes , country music - and a class on how to bake a genuine black forest cake .
also , anyone who is inspired by the races and wants to give sled driving a go can try their hand in a one or two-day " mushing " class .
the classes , which tend to book up fast , cover theoretical as well as practical aspects of dog sledding , such as how to handle the dogs and how to steer a sled .
in february , two nearby black forest towns will host longer races .
bernau will host races on feb .
12 and 13 , and harrischried from feb .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .
but it is n't easy : iran is still suspected of developing nuclear weapons .

14 , 2005 -rrb- iran backs down on uranium enrichment after a deadlock in talks between the eu and iran over uranium enrichment programs , tehran has backed down , saying it will suspend the process , which created atomic fuel for power plants or weapons .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .
his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .

thousands of spectators will turn out to watch some 150 teams try to beat each other over the finish line - weather permitting . think dogsled racing only takes place in alaska ?
think again .
if enough snow is on the ground then , the international federation of sleddog sports will host an international competition from jan .
28 to jan .
30 , in the winter sports resort town of todtmoos , in germany 's black forest .
some 150 of the world 's top mushers - as dogsled drivers are officially known - and their canine charges will descend on the picturesque village near freiburg , in southern baden-württemburg .
growing popularity the first dogsled races in germany took place in the hessian town of bad sooden-allendorf in 1973 .
only 16 mushers and their sleds raced the course .
the handful of onlookers shouted mostly jibes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iditarod , from anchorage to nome , alaska , is the worlds best known dog sledding race since 1975 , todtmoos has hosted the race , and the number of onlookers and fans has risen steadily .
by the time todtmoos hosted the world cup races in 1994 - the first held in europe - the raced was watched by 40,000 enthusiastic spectators .
barking , but not mad with snow-draped evergreens lining the course and amid the aroma of spiced mulled glühwein , attendees at the todtmoos race get to experience dog sledding with that fairytale touch .
but forget spending a " silent night " in the quiet snow .
with 1,000 dogs of various breeds in residence during the races , visitors to todtmoos had better be prepared to put up with howling and yipping .
most of the racing dogs are huskies , but other breeds also participate .
a one-day ticket to the races in todtmoos costs € 6 -lrb- $ 7.80 -rrb- , while a combination ticket to all events costs € 10 per person .
there is also a cultural program to round out the event , including torchlight hikes , country music - and a class on how to bake a genuine black forest cake .
also , anyone who is inspired by the races and wants to give sled driving a go can try their hand in a one or two-day " mushing " class .
the classes , which tend to book up fast , cover theoretical as well as practical aspects of dog sledding , such as how to handle the dogs and how to steer a sled .
in february , two nearby black forest towns will host longer races .
bernau will host races on feb .
12 and 13 , and harrischried from feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.01.2005 airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus , boeing not in the mood for celebrating at the moment a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .
eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

the man or woman has " decorated " some 2,000 to 3,000 piles of puppy poop in a city park with little american flags .
josef öttl of bayreuth 's castle and garden administration is baffled and a little upset about the matter .
" maybe someone is protesting the war in iraq or just trying to let people know that there are too many dog droppings in the park , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this american flag is being treated with more respect the park worker said that the perpetrator frequently stops for weeks on end , only to then " decorate " up to 100 more piles of the canine excrement in a night .
öttl feels that the us is being insulted by the actions .
the police has increased patrols in the area , but a police spokesman said it is not a criminal act to place american flags in doggy doo .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .
his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .
and many economic pundits argue that the reforms enacted so far will not lead to more employment . hardy graupner -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .

thousands of spectators will turn out to watch some 150 teams try to beat each other over the finish line - weather permitting . think dogsled racing only takes place in alaska ?
think again .
if enough snow is on the ground then , the international federation of sleddog sports will host an international competition from jan .
28 to jan .
30 , in the winter sports resort town of todtmoos , in germany 's black forest .
some 150 of the world 's top mushers - as dogsled drivers are officially known - and their canine charges will descend on the picturesque village near freiburg , in southern baden-württemburg .
growing popularity the first dogsled races in germany took place in the hessian town of bad sooden-allendorf in 1973 .
only 16 mushers and their sleds raced the course .
the handful of onlookers shouted mostly jibes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iditarod , from anchorage to nome , alaska , is the worlds best known dog sledding race since 1975 , todtmoos has hosted the race , and the number of onlookers and fans has risen steadily .
by the time todtmoos hosted the world cup races in 1994 - the first held in europe - the raced was watched by 40,000 enthusiastic spectators .
barking , but not mad with snow-draped evergreens lining the course and amid the aroma of spiced mulled glühwein , attendees at the todtmoos race get to experience dog sledding with that fairytale touch .
but forget spending a " silent night " in the quiet snow .
with 1,000 dogs of various breeds in residence during the races , visitors to todtmoos had better be prepared to put up with howling and yipping .
most of the racing dogs are huskies , but other breeds also participate .
a one-day ticket to the races in todtmoos costs € 6 -lrb- $ 7.80 -rrb- , while a combination ticket to all events costs € 10 per person .
there is also a cultural program to round out the event , including torchlight hikes , country music - and a class on how to bake a genuine black forest cake .
also , anyone who is inspired by the races and wants to give sled driving a go can try their hand in a one or two-day " mushing " class .
the classes , which tend to book up fast , cover theoretical as well as practical aspects of dog sledding , such as how to handle the dogs and how to steer a sled .
in february , two nearby black forest towns will host longer races .
bernau will host races on feb .
12 and 13 , and harrischried from feb .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.01.2005 therapy still taboo in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visit to the shrink is socially frowned upon germans may no longer be bottling up their problems , but those who do seek to talk about them with a professional do n't have it easy - old taboos and stigmas still plague the tentative step to the couch . at a world health organisation conference on mental health last week , eu commissioner markos kyprianou described psychological illness as europe 's " unseen killer . " " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .
and there are no rumours of a slump in business . in keeping with the generosity of the german health service , those who stump up their monthly fee can take their psychological problems - be they phobias or depression - to a therapist of their choice at no additional cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychotherapy is an underpraised solution compared to the palette of opportunities in countries like britain and the us , it 's a great deal .
but then again , there are other comparisons which show that germany is less advanced in terms of shaking off the old taboos and stigmas attached to opting to talk through problems with a professional . ongoing taboo " it 's still not easy in germany .
people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .

harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .
his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .

thousands of spectators will turn out to watch some 150 teams try to beat each other over the finish line - weather permitting . think dogsled racing only takes place in alaska ?

if enough snow is on the ground then , the international federation of sleddog sports will host an international competition from jan .
28 to jan .

some 150 of the world 's top mushers - as dogsled drivers are officially known - and their canine charges will descend on the picturesque village near freiburg , in southern baden-württemburg .
growing popularity the first dogsled races in germany took place in the hessian town of bad sooden-allendorf in 1973 .
only 16 mushers and their sleds raced the course .
the handful of onlookers shouted mostly jibes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iditarod , from anchorage to nome , alaska , is the worlds best known dog sledding race since 1975 , todtmoos has hosted the race , and the number of onlookers and fans has risen steadily .
by the time todtmoos hosted the world cup races in 1994 - the first held in europe - the raced was watched by 40,000 enthusiastic spectators .
barking , but not mad with snow-draped evergreens lining the course and amid the aroma of spiced mulled glühwein , attendees at the todtmoos race get to experience dog sledding with that fairytale touch .
but forget spending a " silent night " in the quiet snow .
with 1,000 dogs of various breeds in residence during the races , visitors to todtmoos had better be prepared to put up with howling and yipping .
most of the racing dogs are huskies , but other breeds also participate .
a one-day ticket to the races in todtmoos costs € 6 -lrb- $ 7.80 -rrb- , while a combination ticket to all events costs € 10 per person .
there is also a cultural program to round out the event , including torchlight hikes , country music - and a class on how to bake a genuine black forest cake .
also , anyone who is inspired by the races and wants to give sled driving a go can try their hand in a one or two-day " mushing " class .
the classes , which tend to book up fast , cover theoretical as well as practical aspects of dog sledding , such as how to handle the dogs and how to steer a sled .
in february , two nearby black forest towns will host longer races .
bernau will host races on feb .

" what we are seeing now is a system in which people with psychological problems are told to go to workshops for disabled people , and that 's pretty much the last stop , " drews said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group therapy is another option and although there are a number of small workshop initiatives which promote reintegration and rehabilitation , klaus leonhard says that of the people who enter such protected working environments , no more than 20 percent of them make it back out into the free labor market . prevention is better than a cure in view of such statistics , at least part of the solution has to lie in preventative measures .
" we have to move away from just providing information , we have to change our behaviour , " timo harfst said . he welcomes the introduction of a prevention law which is due to be passed this spring , and sees it as an opportunity to teach germans that factors such as stress , lack of physical exercise , too much television and inadequate social activity can all lead to some form of depression .

boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry .

in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2005 politicians worried about us ' iran stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions are prompting concerns german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .
many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .

thousands of spectators will turn out to watch some 150 teams try to beat each other over the finish line - weather permitting . think dogsled racing only takes place in alaska ?
think again .
if enough snow is on the ground then , the international federation of sleddog sports will host an international competition from jan .
28 to jan .
30 , in the winter sports resort town of todtmoos , in germany 's black forest .
some 150 of the world 's top mushers - as dogsled drivers are officially known - and their canine charges will descend on the picturesque village near freiburg , in southern baden-württemburg .
growing popularity the first dogsled races in germany took place in the hessian town of bad sooden-allendorf in 1973 .
only 16 mushers and their sleds raced the course .
the handful of onlookers shouted mostly jibes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iditarod , from anchorage to nome , alaska , is the worlds best known dog sledding race since 1975 , todtmoos has hosted the race , and the number of onlookers and fans has risen steadily .
by the time todtmoos hosted the world cup races in 1994 - the first held in europe - the raced was watched by 40,000 enthusiastic spectators .
barking , but not mad with snow-draped evergreens lining the course and amid the aroma of spiced mulled glühwein , attendees at the todtmoos race get to experience dog sledding with that fairytale touch .
but forget spending a " silent night " in the quiet snow .
with 1,000 dogs of various breeds in residence during the races , visitors to todtmoos had better be prepared to put up with howling and yipping .
most of the racing dogs are huskies , but other breeds also participate .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .
his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .
and many economic pundits argue that the reforms enacted so far will not lead to more employment . hardy graupner -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .
and there are no rumours of a slump in business . in keeping with the generosity of the german health service , those who stump up their monthly fee can take their psychological problems - be they phobias or depression - to a therapist of their choice at no additional cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychotherapy is an underpraised solution compared to the palette of opportunities in countries like britain and the us , it 's a great deal .
but then again , there are other comparisons which show that germany is less advanced in terms of shaking off the old taboos and stigmas attached to opting to talk through problems with a professional . ongoing taboo " it 's still not easy in germany .
people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .
but as the government gradually chips away at the welfare state , there is less money available to ease their plight . " these days people have other problems . they 're worrying about hartz iv -lrb- the latest slew of labor reforms -rrb- and unemployment rather than about the disabled or those with psychological problems , " klaus leonhard , manager of lankwitz disabled workshop said . recha drews believes that although patients in germany have relatively easy access to therapy , the system no longer provides those who have had to give up their jobs , with the necessary support for a return to regularity .
" what we are seeing now is a system in which people with psychological problems are told to go to workshops for disabled people , and that 's pretty much the last stop , " drews said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group therapy is another option and although there are a number of small workshop initiatives which promote reintegration and rehabilitation , klaus leonhard says that of the people who enter such protected working environments , no more than 20 percent of them make it back out into the free labor market . prevention is better than a cure in view of such statistics , at least part of the solution has to lie in preventative measures .
" we have to move away from just providing information , we have to change our behaviour , " timo harfst said . he welcomes the introduction of a prevention law which is due to be passed this spring , and sees it as an opportunity to teach germans that factors such as stress , lack of physical exercise , too much television and inadequate social activity can all lead to some form of depression .
" it 's time to take a look at the bigger picture , " harfst said . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's mental health headache health ministers and ngo representatives from the 52 member states in the world health organization ’ s european region have put their heads together in helsinki this week to discuss the issue of mental health .

and there are no rumours of a slump in business . in keeping with the generosity of the german health service , those who stump up their monthly fee can take their psychological problems - be they phobias or depression - to a therapist of their choice at no additional cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychotherapy is an underpraised solution compared to the palette of opportunities in countries like britain and the us , it 's a great deal .
but then again , there are other comparisons which show that germany is less advanced in terms of shaking off the old taboos and stigmas attached to opting to talk through problems with a professional . ongoing taboo " it 's still not easy in germany .
people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .
but as the government gradually chips away at the welfare state , there is less money available to ease their plight . " these days people have other problems . they 're worrying about hartz iv -lrb- the latest slew of labor reforms -rrb- and unemployment rather than about the disabled or those with psychological problems , " klaus leonhard , manager of lankwitz disabled workshop said . recha drews believes that although patients in germany have relatively easy access to therapy , the system no longer provides those who have had to give up their jobs , with the necessary support for a return to regularity .
" what we are seeing now is a system in which people with psychological problems are told to go to workshops for disabled people , and that 's pretty much the last stop , " drews said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group therapy is another option and although there are a number of small workshop initiatives which promote reintegration and rehabilitation , klaus leonhard says that of the people who enter such protected working environments , no more than 20 percent of them make it back out into the free labor market . prevention is better than a cure in view of such statistics , at least part of the solution has to lie in preventative measures .
" we have to move away from just providing information , we have to change our behaviour , " timo harfst said . he welcomes the introduction of a prevention law which is due to be passed this spring , and sees it as an opportunity to teach germans that factors such as stress , lack of physical exercise , too much television and inadequate social activity can all lead to some form of depression .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .
his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .
and many economic pundits argue that the reforms enacted so far will not lead to more employment . hardy graupner -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.01.2005 airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus , boeing not in the mood for celebrating at the moment a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .
eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .

but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "

it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .
and there are no rumours of a slump in business . in keeping with the generosity of the german health service , those who stump up their monthly fee can take their psychological problems - be they phobias or depression - to a therapist of their choice at no additional cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychotherapy is an underpraised solution compared to the palette of opportunities in countries like britain and the us , it 's a great deal .
but then again , there are other comparisons which show that germany is less advanced in terms of shaking off the old taboos and stigmas attached to opting to talk through problems with a professional . ongoing taboo " it 's still not easy in germany .
people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .
and there are no rumours of a slump in business . in keeping with the generosity of the german health service , those who stump up their monthly fee can take their psychological problems - be they phobias or depression - to a therapist of their choice at no additional cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychotherapy is an underpraised solution compared to the palette of opportunities in countries like britain and the us , it 's a great deal .
but then again , there are other comparisons which show that germany is less advanced in terms of shaking off the old taboos and stigmas attached to opting to talk through problems with a professional . ongoing taboo " it 's still not easy in germany .
people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .
but as the government gradually chips away at the welfare state , there is less money available to ease their plight . " these days people have other problems . they 're worrying about hartz iv -lrb- the latest slew of labor reforms -rrb- and unemployment rather than about the disabled or those with psychological problems , " klaus leonhard , manager of lankwitz disabled workshop said . recha drews believes that although patients in germany have relatively easy access to therapy , the system no longer provides those who have had to give up their jobs , with the necessary support for a return to regularity .
" what we are seeing now is a system in which people with psychological problems are told to go to workshops for disabled people , and that 's pretty much the last stop , " drews said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group therapy is another option and although there are a number of small workshop initiatives which promote reintegration and rehabilitation , klaus leonhard says that of the people who enter such protected working environments , no more than 20 percent of them make it back out into the free labor market . prevention is better than a cure in view of such statistics , at least part of the solution has to lie in preventative measures .
" we have to move away from just providing information , we have to change our behaviour , " timo harfst said . he welcomes the introduction of a prevention law which is due to be passed this spring , and sees it as an opportunity to teach germans that factors such as stress , lack of physical exercise , too much television and inadequate social activity can all lead to some form of depression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2005 politicians worried about us ' iran stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions are prompting concerns german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .
many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .
and there are no rumours of a slump in business . in keeping with the generosity of the german health service , those who stump up their monthly fee can take their psychological problems - be they phobias or depression - to a therapist of their choice at no additional cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychotherapy is an underpraised solution compared to the palette of opportunities in countries like britain and the us , it 's a great deal .
but then again , there are other comparisons which show that germany is less advanced in terms of shaking off the old taboos and stigmas attached to opting to talk through problems with a professional . ongoing taboo " it 's still not easy in germany .
people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .

" these days people have other problems . they 're worrying about hartz iv -lrb- the latest slew of labor reforms -rrb- and unemployment rather than about the disabled or those with psychological problems , " klaus leonhard , manager of lankwitz disabled workshop said . recha drews believes that although patients in germany have relatively easy access to therapy , the system no longer provides those who have had to give up their jobs , with the necessary support for a return to regularity .

" we have to move away from just providing information , we have to change our behaviour , " timo harfst said . he welcomes the introduction of a prevention law which is due to be passed this spring , and sees it as an opportunity to teach germans that factors such as stress , lack of physical exercise , too much television and inadequate social activity can all lead to some form of depression .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .

his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2005 politicians worried about us ' iran stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions are prompting concerns german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .
many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .
and there are no rumours of a slump in business . in keeping with the generosity of the german health service , those who stump up their monthly fee can take their psychological problems - be they phobias or depression - to a therapist of their choice at no additional cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychotherapy is an underpraised solution compared to the palette of opportunities in countries like britain and the us , it 's a great deal .

people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.01.2005 politicians worried about us ' iran stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear ambitions are prompting concerns german politicians are alarmed following president bush 's comment that he would not rule out military force against iran .
many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .
his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .

thousands of spectators will turn out to watch some 150 teams try to beat each other over the finish line - weather permitting . think dogsled racing only takes place in alaska ?
think again .
if enough snow is on the ground then , the international federation of sleddog sports will host an international competition from jan .
28 to jan .
30 , in the winter sports resort town of todtmoos , in germany 's black forest .
some 150 of the world 's top mushers - as dogsled drivers are officially known - and their canine charges will descend on the picturesque village near freiburg , in southern baden-württemburg .
growing popularity the first dogsled races in germany took place in the hessian town of bad sooden-allendorf in 1973 .
only 16 mushers and their sleds raced the course .
the handful of onlookers shouted mostly jibes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iditarod , from anchorage to nome , alaska , is the worlds best known dog sledding race since 1975 , todtmoos has hosted the race , and the number of onlookers and fans has risen steadily .
by the time todtmoos hosted the world cup races in 1994 - the first held in europe - the raced was watched by 40,000 enthusiastic spectators .
barking , but not mad with snow-draped evergreens lining the course and amid the aroma of spiced mulled glühwein , attendees at the todtmoos race get to experience dog sledding with that fairytale touch .
but forget spending a " silent night " in the quiet snow .
with 1,000 dogs of various breeds in residence during the races , visitors to todtmoos had better be prepared to put up with howling and yipping .
most of the racing dogs are huskies , but other breeds also participate .
a one-day ticket to the races in todtmoos costs € 6 -lrb- $ 7.80 -rrb- , while a combination ticket to all events costs € 10 per person .
there is also a cultural program to round out the event , including torchlight hikes , country music - and a class on how to bake a genuine black forest cake .
also , anyone who is inspired by the races and wants to give sled driving a go can try their hand in a one or two-day " mushing " class .
the classes , which tend to book up fast , cover theoretical as well as practical aspects of dog sledding , such as how to handle the dogs and how to steer a sled .
in february , two nearby black forest towns will host longer races .

thousands of spectators will turn out to watch some 150 teams try to beat each other over the finish line - weather permitting . think dogsled racing only takes place in alaska ?
think again .
if enough snow is on the ground then , the international federation of sleddog sports will host an international competition from jan .
28 to jan .
30 , in the winter sports resort town of todtmoos , in germany 's black forest .
some 150 of the world 's top mushers - as dogsled drivers are officially known - and their canine charges will descend on the picturesque village near freiburg , in southern baden-württemburg .
growing popularity the first dogsled races in germany took place in the hessian town of bad sooden-allendorf in 1973 .
only 16 mushers and their sleds raced the course .
the handful of onlookers shouted mostly jibes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iditarod , from anchorage to nome , alaska , is the worlds best known dog sledding race since 1975 , todtmoos has hosted the race , and the number of onlookers and fans has risen steadily .
by the time todtmoos hosted the world cup races in 1994 - the first held in europe - the raced was watched by 40,000 enthusiastic spectators .
barking , but not mad with snow-draped evergreens lining the course and amid the aroma of spiced mulled glühwein , attendees at the todtmoos race get to experience dog sledding with that fairytale touch .
but forget spending a " silent night " in the quiet snow .
with 1,000 dogs of various breeds in residence during the races , visitors to todtmoos had better be prepared to put up with howling and yipping .
most of the racing dogs are huskies , but other breeds also participate .
a one-day ticket to the races in todtmoos costs € 6 -lrb- $ 7.80 -rrb- , while a combination ticket to all events costs € 10 per person .
there is also a cultural program to round out the event , including torchlight hikes , country music - and a class on how to bake a genuine black forest cake .
also , anyone who is inspired by the races and wants to give sled driving a go can try their hand in a one or two-day " mushing " class .
the classes , which tend to book up fast , cover theoretical as well as practical aspects of dog sledding , such as how to handle the dogs and how to steer a sled .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .

to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .

finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen .

still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .

it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .

thousands of spectators will turn out to watch some 150 teams try to beat each other over the finish line - weather permitting . think dogsled racing only takes place in alaska ?
think again .
if enough snow is on the ground then , the international federation of sleddog sports will host an international competition from jan .
28 to jan .
30 , in the winter sports resort town of todtmoos , in germany 's black forest .
some 150 of the world 's top mushers - as dogsled drivers are officially known - and their canine charges will descend on the picturesque village near freiburg , in southern baden-württemburg .
growing popularity the first dogsled races in germany took place in the hessian town of bad sooden-allendorf in 1973 .
only 16 mushers and their sleds raced the course .
the handful of onlookers shouted mostly jibes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iditarod , from anchorage to nome , alaska , is the worlds best known dog sledding race since 1975 , todtmoos has hosted the race , and the number of onlookers and fans has risen steadily .
by the time todtmoos hosted the world cup races in 1994 - the first held in europe - the raced was watched by 40,000 enthusiastic spectators .
barking , but not mad with snow-draped evergreens lining the course and amid the aroma of spiced mulled glühwein , attendees at the todtmoos race get to experience dog sledding with that fairytale touch .
but forget spending a " silent night " in the quiet snow .
with 1,000 dogs of various breeds in residence during the races , visitors to todtmoos had better be prepared to put up with howling and yipping .
most of the racing dogs are huskies , but other breeds also participate .
a one-day ticket to the races in todtmoos costs € 6 -lrb- $ 7.80 -rrb- , while a combination ticket to all events costs € 10 per person .
there is also a cultural program to round out the event , including torchlight hikes , country music - and a class on how to bake a genuine black forest cake .
also , anyone who is inspired by the races and wants to give sled driving a go can try their hand in a one or two-day " mushing " class .
the classes , which tend to book up fast , cover theoretical as well as practical aspects of dog sledding , such as how to handle the dogs and how to steer a sled .
in february , two nearby black forest towns will host longer races .
bernau will host races on feb .

many german citizens have less than a rosy opinion of american president george w. bush .
in the german city of bayreuth , an unknown assailant has been venting his feelings toward the us - and those feelings do not exactly , shall we say , smell like roses .
the man or woman has " decorated " some 2,000 to 3,000 piles of puppy poop in a city park with little american flags .
josef öttl of bayreuth 's castle and garden administration is baffled and a little upset about the matter .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .
his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .
and many economic pundits argue that the reforms enacted so far will not lead to more employment . hardy graupner -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.01.2005 airbus , boeing dispute could become us-eu problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus , boeing not in the mood for celebrating at the moment a massive dispute is brewing between airbus and its archrival , chicago-based boeing .
eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

but the 10 percent growth in exports did n't help the economy at home much . though germany 's economy managed only a 1.7 percent growth rate last year , german companies took advantage of better-performing economies in other parts of the world to finish as world champions in the export market in 2004 . traditionally a strong export nation , germany last year set a new record for export statistics , with firms selling goods abroad to the tune of over € 730 billion -lrb- $ 954 billion -rrb- . imports made up € 575.4 billion of the trade balance , giving the country its largest surplus in history . a surprise to some the figures released by the federal statistical office came as a surprise to many , as the strong euro and the record-high oil price were thought to have a negative impact on germany ’ s exports .
but the head of the association of german wholesale and foreign traders , anton börner , said german companies were clever enough to take precautionary measures well in advance . the economic boom in the united states and particularly in china played a major role in germany 's export success in 2004 .
chancellor schröder has quickly come to realize the huge potential of german-chinese trade relations and has made a point of regularly visiting china together with a big business delegation .
while german exports to european union member countries grew moderately , exports to nations outside the eu literally skyrocketed . what about at home ? traditional winners such as pharmaceuticals and heavy machinery showed the most improvement over last year , with nine percent more exported .
the auto industry also made strides . but börner warned that the country 's export success did not have a positive impact on domestic demand .
his organization continued to criticize the government for not doing enough to promote germany as an investment destination . employment remains stubbornly low the vicious circle of low growth rates will never improve unless more is done to increase domestic demand , according to börner .
government officials anticipate the 1.7 percent growth rate this year will repeat itself in 2005 , according to a report in the financial times deutschland . the government ’ s assessment appears to be in stark contrast to the projections of most economic research institutes in the country which predict that growth will trickle down to a mere 1.4 percent at best .
economics minister wolfgang clement , whose political fate hinges on the success of the government ’ s labor market reforms , is optimistic that growth rates can be upheld this year . he admits , though , that a considerable reduction in unemployment figures can only be expected for the second half of this year .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .
and there are no rumours of a slump in business . in keeping with the generosity of the german health service , those who stump up their monthly fee can take their psychological problems - be they phobias or depression - to a therapist of their choice at no additional cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychotherapy is an underpraised solution compared to the palette of opportunities in countries like britain and the us , it 's a great deal .

people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .
but as the government gradually chips away at the welfare state , there is less money available to ease their plight . " these days people have other problems . they 're worrying about hartz iv -lrb- the latest slew of labor reforms -rrb- and unemployment rather than about the disabled or those with psychological problems , " klaus leonhard , manager of lankwitz disabled workshop said . recha drews believes that although patients in germany have relatively easy access to therapy , the system no longer provides those who have had to give up their jobs , with the necessary support for a return to regularity .

" we have to move away from just providing information , we have to change our behaviour , " timo harfst said . he welcomes the introduction of a prevention law which is due to be passed this spring , and sees it as an opportunity to teach germans that factors such as stress , lack of physical exercise , too much television and inadequate social activity can all lead to some form of depression .

" " more europeans die from suicide each year than are killed in car accidents or as a result of murder .
yet mental health receives surprisingly little attention , " kyprianou said . the figures certainly add up .
some 58,000 people in the eu die each year as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury , which compares with around 50,700 traffic deaths and around 5,350 as a result of murder or homicide .
most suicides are linked to mental illness , and in particular depression . therapy still plagued by stigma although it is impossible to say exactly how many people in germany are currently in therapy , there are almost 6,000 psychotherapists across the country who work with health insurance companies , and in addition , an undetermined number of private and alternative therapists touting their wares to patients in need .

people react with reservation and some social groups perceive the need for psychological help as a weakness , " timo harfst , academic advisor at the german chamber of psychotherapists said . but that is not all .
harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch .

harfst believes that the therapy taboo runs so deep in the veins of german society that a kind of self-stigmatism kicks in , with those in need of outside help refusing to go and find it for fear that they will be acquiring a stain that will stick . steffi buchal confirmed it .
" i was going through a really bad time , and i felt like i needed to go and talk to someone , " buchal said .
" but when i told my friends , they were all horrified .
they tried to persuade me that i did n't need to see anyone , insisting they could help me through my rough patch . " in the end , steffi ignored the advice of her friends and started therapy , but several months later she quit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : therapy comes in different forms " people think that if you go for therapy that you have no family or friends to talk to , but the reality is that there are situations in which it is better to talk to a therapist than to a family member , " said recha drews , business economist with prenzl komm , a non-profit organization .
" germans do n't take depression very seriously , they prefer to sweep it under the carpet . " the trials of re-integration prenzl komm aims to help people who have been out of work as a result of psychological problems to find a way back into a more independent existence .
but as the government gradually chips away at the welfare state , there is less money available to ease their plight . " these days people have other problems . they 're worrying about hartz iv -lrb- the latest slew of labor reforms -rrb- and unemployment rather than about the disabled or those with psychological problems , " klaus leonhard , manager of lankwitz disabled workshop said . recha drews believes that although patients in germany have relatively easy access to therapy , the system no longer provides those who have had to give up their jobs , with the necessary support for a return to regularity .
" what we are seeing now is a system in which people with psychological problems are told to go to workshops for disabled people , and that 's pretty much the last stop , " drews said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : group therapy is another option and although there are a number of small workshop initiatives which promote reintegration and rehabilitation , klaus leonhard says that of the people who enter such protected working environments , no more than 20 percent of them make it back out into the free labor market . prevention is better than a cure in view of such statistics , at least part of the solution has to lie in preventative measures .
" we have to move away from just providing information , we have to change our behaviour , " timo harfst said . he welcomes the introduction of a prevention law which is due to be passed this spring , and sees it as an opportunity to teach germans that factors such as stress , lack of physical exercise , too much television and inadequate social activity can all lead to some form of depression .
" it 's time to take a look at the bigger picture , " harfst said . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's mental health headache health ministers and ngo representatives from the 52 member states in the world health organization ’ s european region have put their heads together in helsinki this week to discuss the issue of mental health .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .
and so does german foreign minister and unofficial green party leader , joschka fischer .
in the past few months , he has repeatedly told the regime in teheran that it may be miscalculating the eu 's ability to hinder the us from using military force .
" i can only appeal to those responsible to not come to false conclusions that is n't in the interest of iran , is n't in the interest of regional stability and is n't in the interest of the european union , " fischer said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nukes overshadow eu-iran trade talks the eu and iran have once again begun discussing a trade agreement .

many are warning against an escalation of the conflict . american investigative journalist seymour hersh 's report that the us military has been actively carrying out military preparations for a preemptive strike against iran and president bush 's statement that he would not rule out military force against iran over its nuclear program have sent alarm bells ringing in germany .
representatives from across the political spectrum have responded with varying degrees of concern about the possibility of another conflict in the region .
in an interview with daily berliner zeitung , claudia roth , party chairwoman of the greens , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , said diplomatic solutions were needed and not " threats of force . "
it 's a stance that 's backed by all party members . greens spokeswoman krista sager called such plans a “ very dangerous policy ” .
the governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has reacted similarly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd foreign affairs expert , gernot erler , does not see eye to eye with bush administration 's iran policy foreign affairs expert gernot erler has demanded that the us provide its nato partners with all its plans regarding iran .
he called threats against the iranian government at odds with european union efforts to reach a diplomatic solution for iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
" the approach provided by the three european governments of the united kingdom , france and germany is not compatible with the american approach of threatening with military intervention , " erler said .
the eu , led by the united kingdom , france and germany , has negotiated numerous times with teheran to try and persuade the country to give up its goals of producing atomic weapons .
in november , iran succumbed to the demands of the eu and the international atomic energy agency to halt all activities related to the enrichment of uranium .
us should be more willing to negotiate while those in the green party and the spd are more critical of the potential for conflict between the us and iran , the center-right opposition party , the christian democrats , think that cooperation between the us and the eu is the best way to bring about a lasting solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are concerns in europe that such photos of us troops will be coming from iran former german defense secretary , volker ruhe , suggested that the us should determine how it can best support european nuclear negotiations with concrete proposals to motivate iran ’ s mullahs to permanently reject an atomic weapons option .
long-time foreign policy expert from the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble , warned against over-dramatizing the situation .
in an interview in the newspaper die welt , schäuble asserted that it is iran ’ s attempts to become an atomic power that pose the real threat , not the position of the united states . the christian democrats ' iran expert , ruprecht polenz , bemoaned that the bush administration does not bring any political solutions to the negotiating table .
threat blown out of proportion ?
luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , whose country holds the eu presidency , said he could not possibly believe that after the bad experience in iraq , that the us would possibly attack iran .
" i ca n't imagine that this is serious american policy , " said asselborn .
yet it is exactly the policy during the first four years of the bush administration that frightens some european politicians .
good cop , bad cop bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer does n't think the us will be too patient too long with iran the eu is eager to negotiate with iran .
just last week , it again met with iranian representatives in brussels to discuss a possible trade agreement , something that iran has long been striving for .
but the eu can not and will not forever play the role of the good cop while the us holds a big stick in its hand .
asselborn shares this belief .

despite having a " lame duck " leader - the republican party in the u.s. looks set to stay in power for the long haul . after thursday 's inauguration , george w. bush will turn into a " lame duck " president , one who ca n't run for another term under u.s. law .
experience shows that his political power will diminish over the course of the next four years , especially his power to influence congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first bush inauguration , in 2001 despite this , the republican party may well be on the verge of a new era of dominance as the " natural majority party " according to chief bush strategist karl rove .
on certain topics , the republicans have long commanded an almost uncontested dominance .
now , the party 's plan is to make this situation permanent .
whether this can be done depends on many factors , including the future health of the democratic party , power struggles among republicans and the question of whether extremism within the government will grow to the point where moderates will be scared off in large numbers .
meeting little resistance meanwhile , the republicans have little to fear from their main opposition , the democrats .
while some commentators and republicans note that the defeat of the democrats in the last election was n't exactly decisive , it nonetheless gave rise to an internal struggle that may take years to resolve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican california gov. arnold schwarzenegger appears to have a bright future when politics becomes mainly a question of winning elections , and no longer follows a vision of creating a model for society , closely lost elections become especially painful .
that 's why the part of the democratic party that found the kerry-edwards ticket too far to the " left " would rather revive a clintonian neo-liberalism - even if john kerry 's positions were n't really very far from bill clinton 's .
others want to see politics turn yet further to the " values " of the south - where the republicans made great gains - and are questioning abortion rights , for example .
to save itself , the democratic party is making itself superfluous .
in addition , the 2004 election exposed the organizational weakness of the democrats .
while democratic get-out-the-vote drives from activist groups garnered praised from all quarters , the republicans were even more successful .
' family values ' the republicans ' strength caught the democrats by surprise .
but the democrats ' urgent technical analysis of the 2004 election results ignores a basic problem : while democratic voting coalitions are becoming more and more heterogeneous , the republicans are being sustained by a social movement - the -lrb- white -rrb- christian right - which promotes a comprehensive vision of how america should look in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush beat sen. john kerry in the november election moreover , the republican strategy to promote a conservative concept of " family values " appeals strongly to a portion of the democrats ' core constituency .
finally , the democrats hardly managed to offer an economic or sociopolitical vision to their core voters , which explains why the second republican vision - the supremacy of the free market and private responsibility - was so well received by middle-of-the-road democrats .
in the short and middle term , then , the republicans have only themselves to defeat .
still , this particular scenario is not beyond the realm of possibility .
too far to the right ?
on the one hand , despite the fact that the population appears to be polarized along cultural-religious lines , it is not clear how much backing there is for a politics based entirely on tightly proscribed " christian values . "
under ronald reagan and george h.w. bush , the christian right mostly received only rhetorical support , despite government support of some " faith-based initiatives , " which make federal funds available to religious institutions engaged in social programs .
and while the democrats in the senate -lrb- the upper house of the legislature -rrb- may be able to forestall , for the short term , the nominations of overly radical judges or cabinet ministers , the blocking of candidates would ultimately allow the republican establishment to paint the democrats as obstructionist " bogeymen . "
still , americans have rejected overly rigorous moralizing in the past , for example , during prohibition .
pension system issue is key while the massive republican campaign to malign all government-backed , tax payer-funded social systems was largely successful , if bush actually manages to push through his plans for privatizing the pension system , nothing will hinder the current american social fabric from unravelling .
the u.s. pension system has until now kept the rudimentary american social welfare system firmly anchored in the middle class , and dismantling it would inevitably lead to massive societal discrepancies .
to some degree , this is necessary for economic growth , but as the discrepancies grow , so does social conflict .
if this should happen , the democratic party and the unions could then revive collective action in reinstating some level of social equality .
that , in turn , could then become a key to the renewal of " their " social movement .
foreign policy issues last but not least is the question of foreign policy .
bush has promised that from now on he will choose his words more carefully , and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said he wants to offend the allies less frequently .
but at the same time , rumors about plans for a military attack on iran are floating around in the media .
it reminds one of theodore roosevelt 's dictum , " speak softly and carry a big stick . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cindy miles weeps at the casket of her son , army pfc timmy brown , jr. who was killed in iraq .
it is not clear whether neo-conservatives will be allowed to continue their military-backed campaigns , or whether a more classical realism will be dominant during bush 's second term .
but all republican foreign policy experts agree on one thing : any challenge to america 's superpower status should be impeded .
indeed , nearly all foreign policy experts , in both parties , agree that american interests are universal interests .
american interests will never play second fiddle to stated interests of the world community - for instance , those laid out by the united nations .
thus , if military action is justified as being necessary to defend american interests - always a possibility - then it will be supported and carried out in a bipartisan manner .
this will be the case even if it means stretching the u.s. military and financial systems too thin , and even despite the apparent difficulty of winning not only a war , but peace .
if such tactics lead to long-term military engagement , with attendant loss of american life , then the " body-bag theory " - that american dissatisfaction with its leadership grows with every fallen u.s. soldier - may finally be played out in the voting booth .

thousands of spectators will turn out to watch some 150 teams try to beat each other over the finish line - weather permitting . think dogsled racing only takes place in alaska ?
think again .
if enough snow is on the ground then , the international federation of sleddog sports will host an international competition from jan .
28 to jan .
30 , in the winter sports resort town of todtmoos , in germany 's black forest .
some 150 of the world 's top mushers - as dogsled drivers are officially known - and their canine charges will descend on the picturesque village near freiburg , in southern baden-württemburg .
growing popularity the first dogsled races in germany took place in the hessian town of bad sooden-allendorf in 1973 .
only 16 mushers and their sleds raced the course .
the handful of onlookers shouted mostly jibes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iditarod , from anchorage to nome , alaska , is the worlds best known dog sledding race since 1975 , todtmoos has hosted the race , and the number of onlookers and fans has risen steadily .
by the time todtmoos hosted the world cup races in 1994 - the first held in europe - the raced was watched by 40,000 enthusiastic spectators .
barking , but not mad with snow-draped evergreens lining the course and amid the aroma of spiced mulled glühwein , attendees at the todtmoos race get to experience dog sledding with that fairytale touch .
but forget spending a " silent night " in the quiet snow .
with 1,000 dogs of various breeds in residence during the races , visitors to todtmoos had better be prepared to put up with howling and yipping .
most of the racing dogs are huskies , but other breeds also participate .
a one-day ticket to the races in todtmoos costs € 6 -lrb- $ 7.80 -rrb- , while a combination ticket to all events costs € 10 per person .
there is also a cultural program to round out the event , including torchlight hikes , country music - and a class on how to bake a genuine black forest cake .
also , anyone who is inspired by the races and wants to give sled driving a go can try their hand in a one or two-day " mushing " class .
the classes , which tend to book up fast , cover theoretical as well as practical aspects of dog sledding , such as how to handle the dogs and how to steer a sled .
in february , two nearby black forest towns will host longer races .
bernau will host races on feb .
12 and 13 , and harrischried from feb .

eu officials , though standing firm , hope the issue wo n't explode before bush visits the continent in february . airbus chief noel forgeard seldom wastes an opportunity to let the competition from boeing know they are second best . the european association finished 2004 with more orders than their american competitor , and its much hyped a380 jumbo jet was unveiled early this week to great fanfare .
boeing , which is also planning to unveil a new jumbo jet , has accused its european competitors of receiving unfair government subsidies to launch their recent aircraft projects and is threatening to take the issue before the world trade organization . last fall , in the midst of a bitter re-election campaign , u.s. president george w. bush cancelled a 1992 agreement between america and the european union that structured the flow of subsidies for the aerospace industry . " what the americans realized is that airbus is n't just a big competitor , but the worldwide market leader , " said claude veron-reville , the spokesman for the eu commission .
" and that is totally different from the 1980s . " billions in subsidies on both sides the 1992 agreement allowed airbus owners france , spain , great britain and germany to extend credit to cover one-third of the cost of aircraft development .
but the big four were able to cover more than € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- of the new jumbo jet a380 's development , and washington said they did it with low-interest loans . forgeard said airbus has paid back any loans , with interest .
in turn , the eu accused the us government of funnelling billions of dollars in indirect subsidies to boeing through its defense contracts and state tax breaks and has filed a formal complaint with the wto . before things got too far , bob zoellick , the us trade representative , sought to mediate the dispute in early january , setting up negotiations between him and the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
the eu is hoping to convince washington over the next three months that both sides should end subsidies for the aerospace industry altogether . but the european countries behind airbus also have a vested interest in providing subsidies to the company : production of the a380 alone employs 40,000 people in germany . keep it low profile german chancellor gerhard schröder could n't resist a jab at washington at the a380 's unveiling in toulouse on tuesday .
the " european flag " should be held high during negotiations with the u.s. , he said , and said airbus needs to be ready to open itself up eastward , to russia . at the moment , eu commission president jose barroso seems relieved that the transatlantic dispute remains under the radar ahead of bush 's visit to brussels in february . " a trade dispute should not influence other political fields , " he said .
" let 's try and solve the problem .
if we ca n't , then let 's not let the transatlantic dialog suffer .

the move is a surprising one because china is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy .
last year 24 provinces suffered black outs .
the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments .
topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river .
" construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact ... they are typical illegal projects of construction first , approval next , " said sepa vice-director pan yue , in a statement on the agency 's website .
temporary halt ?
some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits , but others would be cancelled , he said .
altogether , the agency ordered 30 projects halted .
other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian .
the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants , with some extensions to existing ones .
the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government 's battle to control projects licensed by local officials .
however , previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity , such as steel and cement .
the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year .
in 2004 , china increased its generating capacity by 12.6 % to 440,700 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- .
the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project , designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity .
it is being built on the jinshajiang - or ' river of golden sand ' as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known .
second and third on the agency 's list were two power stations being built at the $ 22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4,200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant .
criticism the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad .
it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists .
the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china .
in april 2004 , central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river , which is part of a united nations world heritage site , the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze , mekong and nu -lrb- also known as the salween -rrb- , according to the uk-published china review .
that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams , and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists .
china 's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil , coal and shipping last year .

some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits , but others would be cancelled , he said .
altogether , the agency ordered 30 projects halted .
other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian .
the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants , with some extensions to existing ones .
the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government 's battle to control projects licensed by local officials .
however , previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity , such as steel and cement .
the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year .
in 2004 , china increased its generating capacity by 12.6 % to 440,700 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- .
the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project , designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity .
it is being built on the jinshajiang - or ' river of golden sand ' as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known .
second and third on the agency 's list were two power stations being built at the $ 22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4,200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant .
criticism the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad .
it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists .
the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china .
in april 2004 , central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river , which is part of a united nations world heritage site , the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze , mekong and nu -lrb- also known as the salween -rrb- , according to the uk-published china review .
that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams , and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists .
china 's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil , coal and shipping last year .

here are some highlights from past inaugural speeches .
george washington thomas jefferson james madison andrew jackson abraham lincoln theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson franklin roosevelt john f kennedy ronald reagan george washington the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered , perhaps , as deeply , as finally , staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people .
the first us president also announced in the 1789 speech that he would accept no pay for being chief executive return to the top thomas jefferson let us reflect that , having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered , we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic , as wicked , and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions .
jefferson 's first inauguration , in 1801 , took place amidst bitter partisan rancour between federalists and anti-federalists return to the top james madison -lrb- 1813 -rrb- as the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects , we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honour , no usage of civilized nations , no precept of courtesy or humanity , have been infringed .
the war has been waged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations , and in a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed .
how little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy !
they have retained as prisoners of war citizens of the united states not liable to be so considered under the usages of war .
madison 's 1813 speech was the first presidential inauguration during time of war - the us was fighting britain return to the top andrew jackson as long as our government is administered for the good of the people , and is regulated by their will ; as long as it secures to us the rights of person and of property , liberty of conscience and of the press , it will be worth defending .
jackson argued in his 1829 inaugural that no standing army was required ; a citizens ' militia would be enough to defend the country return to the top abraham lincoln i have no purpose , directly or indirectly , to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists .
i believe i have no lawful right to do so , and i have no inclination to do so .
a number of slave-holding states had already seceded from the union when lincoln made his 1861 speech , and the civil war broke out weeks later .
lincoln 's 1863 emancipation proclamation declared slaves in the confederacy to be free .
by the time of lincoln 's second inauguration in 1865 , the civil war was drawing to a close and the president was hoping to heal the nation : with malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations .
the war ended a month to the day after lincoln 's speech - but he was assassinated five days later return to the top theodore roosevelt upon the success of our experiment much depends , not only as regards our own welfare , but as regards the welfare of mankind .
if we fail , the cause of free self-government throughout the world will rock to its foundations , and therefore our responsibility is heavy , to ourselves , to the world as it is to-day , and to the generations yet unborn .
roosevelt , speaking in 1905 , was the first us president to act on a world stage - and was well aware of the significance the office had assumed return to the top woodrow wilson we have squandered a great part of what we might have used , and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature , without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent , scorning to be careful , shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient .
we have been proud of our industrial achievements , but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the human cost .
wilson came into office in 1913 promising reform as his democrats took control of the white house and congress for the first time in a generation return to the top franklin roosevelt the only thing we have to fear is fear itself .
fdr devoted much of his 1933 speech to explaining how he would fight the great depression - but began with his famous exhortation by the time of fdr 's second inaugural in 1937 , there were some signs of economic recovery , but the country was still not free of the depression : the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much ; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little .
return to the top john f kennedy let every nation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price , bear any burden , meet any hardship , support any friend , oppose any foe , in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty . ...
let us never negotiate out of fear .
but let us never fear to negotiate . ...
and so , my fellow americans : ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country .
kennedy came to power in 1961 calling for both hope and sacrifice at the height of the cold war return to the top ronald reagan above all , we must realize that no arsenal , or no weapon in the arsenals of the world , is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women .
it is a weapon our adversaries in today 's world do not have .
it is a weapon that we as americans do have .
let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbours .
after several presidents who had advocated co-existence with the soviet union , reagan came to power in 1981 with a more confrontational style in his second inauguration , in 1985 , reagan promised smaller government : we must take further steps to permanently control government 's power to tax and spend .
we must act now to protect future generations from government 's desire to spend its citizens ' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due .

the first us president also announced in the 1789 speech that he would accept no pay for being chief executive return to the top thomas jefferson let us reflect that , having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered , we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic , as wicked , and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions .
jefferson 's first inauguration , in 1801 , took place amidst bitter partisan rancour between federalists and anti-federalists return to the top james madison -lrb- 1813 -rrb- as the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects , we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honour , no usage of civilized nations , no precept of courtesy or humanity , have been infringed .
the war has been waged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations , and in a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed .
how little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy !
they have retained as prisoners of war citizens of the united states not liable to be so considered under the usages of war .
madison 's 1813 speech was the first presidential inauguration during time of war - the us was fighting britain return to the top andrew jackson as long as our government is administered for the good of the people , and is regulated by their will ; as long as it secures to us the rights of person and of property , liberty of conscience and of the press , it will be worth defending .
jackson argued in his 1829 inaugural that no standing army was required ; a citizens ' militia would be enough to defend the country return to the top abraham lincoln i have no purpose , directly or indirectly , to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists .
i believe i have no lawful right to do so , and i have no inclination to do so .
a number of slave-holding states had already seceded from the union when lincoln made his 1861 speech , and the civil war broke out weeks later .
lincoln 's 1863 emancipation proclamation declared slaves in the confederacy to be free .
by the time of lincoln 's second inauguration in 1865 , the civil war was drawing to a close and the president was hoping to heal the nation : with malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds , to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan , to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations .
the war ended a month to the day after lincoln 's speech - but he was assassinated five days later return to the top theodore roosevelt upon the success of our experiment much depends , not only as regards our own welfare , but as regards the welfare of mankind .
if we fail , the cause of free self-government throughout the world will rock to its foundations , and therefore our responsibility is heavy , to ourselves , to the world as it is to-day , and to the generations yet unborn .
roosevelt , speaking in 1905 , was the first us president to act on a world stage - and was well aware of the significance the office had assumed return to the top woodrow wilson we have squandered a great part of what we might have used , and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature , without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent , scorning to be careful , shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient .

wilson came into office in 1913 promising reform as his democrats took control of the white house and congress for the first time in a generation return to the top franklin roosevelt the only thing we have to fear is fear itself .
fdr devoted much of his 1933 speech to explaining how he would fight the great depression - but began with his famous exhortation by the time of fdr 's second inaugural in 1937 , there were some signs of economic recovery , but the country was still not free of the depression : the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much ; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little .

let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbours .
after several presidents who had advocated co-existence with the soviet union , reagan came to power in 1981 with a more confrontational style in his second inauguration , in 1985 , reagan promised smaller government : we must take further steps to permanently control government 's power to tax and spend .
we must act now to protect future generations from government 's desire to spend its citizens ' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due .

the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- said ministers had failed to engage gps , with 50 % knowing little about the plan .
a computer system to allow patients to choose the time and date of their appointment was also behind schedule .
but health secretary john reid insisted the plans were " on schedule " and was confident the targets would be reached .
this will be the biggest step forward in terms of patient power in the nhs in the six decades since it started john reid health secretary q & a : nhs patient choice is choice possible ?
the government is committed to giving patients the choice of using up to five hospitals or other healthcare providers by december 2005 for non-emergency care .
there are 9.4m such referrals each year , representing about half the nhs ' hospital workload .
more than 200,000 bookings should have been made by the end of last year but only 63 had , the nao said .
however , mr reid told bbc news the situation was not as " dramatically bad as it sounds " , adding that the targets would still be met .
mr reid said : " this will be the biggest step forward in terms of patient power in the nhs in the six decades since it started . "
he admitted the it side of the plans was running " weeks , but not months or years late " , but added that was not surprising given the " magnitude " of the operation .
nao head sir john bourn said getting gps on board was key to giving patients choice .
race against time " the department of health must take urgent and effective action to inform and engage with gps about the new arrangements , " he said .
patient-choice report in full full report -lrb- 911kb -rrb- most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
download the reader here the nao quizzed 1,500 gps for the study and found half knew little about the policy and 61 % were negative about choice , fearing it would increase the length of consultations .
providing choice will be dependent on the " choose and book " it system , which will allow patients to pick their own appointments .
but the government is facing a race against time to ensure individual hospital and gp surgery systems are compatible with the central e-booking system .
disappointment as yet only seven nhs trusts have got the system up-and-running and some 29 % of primary care trusts -lrb- pcts -rrb- said they did not envisage delivering choice by the end of the year .
patients association chairman michael summers said he was disappointed the government was falling behind target .
and dr hamish meldrum , chairman of the british medical association 's gps committee , said there was still a lot of work to be done before gps were convinced the initiative would be successful .
" gps feel they are working in an information desert and will need much more detail and experience of what is involved before they can be convinced of the benefits , " he said .
rhetoric or reality ?
mr reid said £ 90 million extra funding would be made available as an incentive for gps .
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said the government would miss the december deadline .
" labour talk about choice but fail to deliver it because family doctors are not given the incentives and tools they need to make it work , " he said .
and liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow said the report illustrated " the gulf between the government 's rhetoric on choice and reality " .

only three countries - india , poland and the philippines - out of 21 polled believed the world was now safer .
the survey found that 47 % of the 21,953 people questioned now see us influence in the world as largely negative , and view americans negatively as well .
none of the countries polled supported contributing their troops to iraq .
" this is quite a grim picture for the us , " said steven kull , director of the program on international policy attitudes -lrb- pipa -rrb- , which carried out the poll with globescan . "
there may be some underlying openness to repairing relations with the us " " steven kull bush election riles europeans india backs bush " negative feelings about bush are high and are generalising to the american people who re-elected him . "
on average across all countries , 58 % of people - and 16 out of 21 countries polled - said they believed mr bush 's re-election to the white house made the world more dangerous .
traditional allies most negative feelings were found in western european , latin american and muslim countries .
they include traditional us allies such as germany , france , britain and italy as well as neighbours canada and mexico .
the only european country to buck the trend was poland , one of the new members of the european union , which gave the thumbs up to both president bush and the us .
turkey topped the anti-bush list , with 82 % believing his re-election would be negative for global security .
the result is bad news for the president as turkey is a us ally and the only muslim member of nato , says the bbc 's chris morris in brussels .
other predominantly muslim countries - indonesia and lebanon - were also high up the list .
but , any warmer feelings in indonesia towards the us following its tsunami relief operations would not show up as the poll was carried out before the disaster struck , says the bbc 's dan isaacs .
economic boom anti-bush sentiments also appeared to be strong in latin america .
argentina , with 79 % , and brazil , with 78 % , follow turkey in the list .
this seems surprising given that the region has had less direct involvement in us foreign policy issues , says our correspondent .
another surprise was india 's support for mr bush .
the poll found 62 % believed his administration was positive for global security .
the bbc 's nick bryant says the reason for this may be because the poll was carried out in cities where people have benefited economically from closer trade ties with the us .
doug miller , president of globescan , said the findings " supports the view of some americans that unless his administration changes its approach to world affairs in its second term , it will continue to erode america 's good name , and hence its ability to effectively influence world affairs " .
but mr kull says the results do not constitute a definitive world-wide majority , " suggesting there may be some underlying openness to repairing relations with the us " .
pipa interviewed between 500 and 1,800 people in each of the 21 countries surveyed , plus 1,000 americans , in face-to-face or telephone interviews .
the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005 .
the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points , depending on the country .

there may be some underlying openness to repairing relations with the us " steven kull bush election riles europeans india backs bush " negative feelings about bush are high and are generalising to the american people who re-elected him . "
on average across all countries , 58 % of people - and 16 out of 21 countries polled - said they believed mr bush 's re-election to the white house made the world more dangerous .
traditional allies most negative feelings were found in western european , latin american and muslim countries .
they include traditional us allies such as germany , france , britain and italy as well as neighbours canada and mexico .
read key points and see graphs from the world service poll .
at-a-glance the only european country to buck the trend was poland , one of the new members of the european union , which gave the thumbs up to both president bush and the us .
turkey topped the anti-bush list , with 82 % believing his re-election would be negative for global security .
the result is bad news for the president as turkey is a us ally and the only muslim member of nato , says the bbc 's chris morris in brussels .
other predominantly muslim countries - indonesia and lebanon - were also high up the list .
but , any warmer feelings in indonesia towards the us following its tsunami relief operations would not show up as the poll was carried out before the disaster struck , says the bbc 's dan isaacs .
economic boom anti-bush sentiments also appeared to be strong in latin america .
argentina , with 79 % , and brazil , with 78 % , follow turkey in the list .
this seems surprising given that the region has had less direct involvement in us foreign policy issues , says our correspondent .
another surprise was india 's support for mr bush .
the poll found 62 % believed his administration was positive for global security .
the bbc 's nick bryant says the reason for this may be because the poll was carried out in cities where people have benefited economically from closer trade ties with the us .
doug miller , president of globescan , said the findings " supports the view of some americans that unless his administration changes its approach to world affairs in its second term , it will continue to erode america 's good name , and hence its ability to effectively influence world affairs " .
but mr kull says the results do not constitute a definitive world-wide majority , " suggesting there may be some underlying openness to repairing relations with the us " .
pipa interviewed between 500 and 1,800 people in each of the 21 countries surveyed , plus 1,000 americans , in face-to-face or telephone interviews .
the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005 .
the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points , depending on the country .

scansoft and gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control .
they want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car , or at home or on the move .
huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs hard .
" voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections , " said ross blanchard , vice president of business development for gracenote .
" these applications will radically change the car entertainment experience , allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel , " he added .
individual song gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as apple 's itunes .
the new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of a collection , just by saying its name .
users will also be able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion , or a film just by saying the actor 's name .
" speech is a natural fit for today 's consumer devices , particularly in mobile environments , " said alan schwartz , vice president of speechworks , a division of scansoft .
" pairing our voice technologies with gracenote 's vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to a host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they 've never imagined . "
the two firms did not say if they were developing the technology for languages other than english .
users will also be able to get more information on a favourite song they have been listening to by asking : " what is this ? "
portable players are becoming popular in cars and a number of auto firms are working with apple to device interfaces to control the firm 's ipod music player .
but with tens of thousands of songs able to be stored on one player , voice control would make finding that elusive track by elvis presley much easier .
the firms gave no indication about whether the ipod , or any other media player , were in mind for the use of the voice control technology .
the companies estimate that the technology will be available in the fourth quarter of 2005 .

scansoft and gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control .
they want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car , or at home or on the move .
huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs hard .
" voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections , " said ross blanchard , vice president of business development for gracenote .
" these applications will radically change the car entertainment experience , allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel , " he added .
individual song gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as apple 's itunes .
the new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of a collection , just by saying its name .
users will also be able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion , or a film just by saying the actor 's name .
" speech is a natural fit for today 's consumer devices , particularly in mobile environments , " said alan schwartz , vice president of speechworks , a division of scansoft .
" pairing our voice technologies with gracenote 's vast music database will bring the benefits of speech technologies to a host of consumer devices and enable people to access their media in ways they 've never imagined . "
the two firms did not say if they were developing the technology for languages other than english .
users will also be able to get more information on a favourite song they have been listening to by asking : " what is this ? "
portable players are becoming popular in cars and a number of auto firms are working with apple to device interfaces to control the firm 's ipod music player .
but with tens of thousands of songs able to be stored on one player , voice control would make finding that elusive track by elvis presley much easier .
the firms gave no indication about whether the ipod , or any other media player , were in mind for the use of the voice control technology .
the companies estimate that the technology will be available in the fourth quarter of 2005 .
