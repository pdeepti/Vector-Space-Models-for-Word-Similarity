program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.01.2005 first german immigration law takes effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners already living in germany also face changes after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .
from jan .
1 , 2005 , things have changed for foreigners . the catalyst for germany 's first immigration law was the realization that the country 's graying population and declining birth rate will one day threaten to overwhelm social security systems and disrupt the economy if young people did n't immigrate to the country . at the same time , the new law represents a political compromise by not unrestrainedly throwing open the labor market to immigrants .
in light of the country 's high unemployment rate , many politicians were wary of doing that , much to the ire of german companies . thus , foreigners from non-eu countries will still be denied access to simple jobs .
but , they can make use of special regulations - such as temporary contracts for seasonal workers and nursing personnel - to work in germany .
even job-seekers from the ten countries that joined the eu in may this year will have to be patient : only after seven years will they be permitted to look for jobs in germany on their own . a question of qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian computer specialist harianto wijaya , 25 , right , presents his " green card " to the media however , highly-qualified immigrants will get a better deal , regardless of where they come from .
according to the green card regulation initiated in 2000 , foreign computer experts had to leave germany after five years .
the new law allows them to stay permanently .
foreign graduates of german universities will have a year to look for a job here if they want to stay in the country . the new immigration regulation also welcomes self-employed immigrants - provided they invest a minimum of € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- and create 10 new jobs .
the law also tackles a crucial deterrent to highly-qualified immigrants : bureaucracy .
people who wish to work in germany will thus receive a work and residence permit at one central place , such as the german embassy in their home country . german for newcomers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drawing lessons from the past , lawmakers also instilled in the regulation measures meant to improve integration in the face of widespread beliefs that a large number of the roughly 7.3 million foreigners living in germany have not adjusted socially to their adopted country . starting next year , new immigrants will have the right to participate in state-funded german language classes and receive an introduction to the country 's justice system , culture and history .
the government has earmarked over € 200 million towards that purpose . the authorities may also force foreigners already living in germany to participate in the courses or forfeit their residence permits or social handouts . such courses were previously only offered to ethnic germans , most of whom immigrated from the former soviet union .
the new law requires ethnic germans as well as their family members to pass a language test before they will be allowed to move to germany . changes for refugees the law also brings small improvements for refugees by being more specific on the recognition of non-state and gender-specific persecution .
refugees from countries that can not provide protection from persecution will have the right to asylum , including women who fear genital mutilation in their home countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the law does n't afford an overall right of residence for rejected asylum-seekers who have lived in germany a long time .
they will face deportation , despite refugee organizations ' efforts . only a small portion of the around 20,000 rejected asylum-seekers a year will profit from the law .
those who have already lived in germany for five years and can not be deported for legal reasons - if they can expect to be tortured in their home countries , for instance - will receive a limited residence permit . individual german states may now decide on a case-by-case basis against deportation .
such decisions will be taken by special commissions that include representatives from the churches as well as the office for foreigners .
with the exception of bavaria , lower saxony and bremen , all german states have said they will set up such commissions in 2005 . deporting terror suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors shout during a demonstration against the court decision on islamic leader muhammed metin kaplan in cologne the law is also meant to keep suspected foreign terrorists from legally immigrating to germany .
before an application for permanent residency is approved by the authorities , germany 's intelligence agency will carry out a background check on every case . the immigration law will also make it easier to deport foreigners suspected of terrorist links , so-called " islamic hate-preachers " and human traffickers . bernd gräßler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim integrationists or extremists ?
in their attempts to contain islamic extremism , german authorities try not to paint all muslims as radicals .
but it 's not always easy , since germany 's largest muslim group , milli görüs , raises suspicions among many .
-lrb- nov .
28 , 2004 -rrb- more skilled labor needed , experts say germany 's expert commission on immigration and integration says 25,000 qualified immigrants are needed to fill holes in the service industry in 2005 .
the suggestion has already met with resistance .
-lrb- oct .
20 , 2004 -rrb- german parties reach immigration law agreement germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers .
-lrb- july 17 , 2004 -rrb- europe 's integration challenge read dw-world 's dossier on the issues surrounding the integration of immigrants to europe and germany .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .

thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .

the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .

please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .

nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?

but saying goodbye is n't always easy . in 2003 , the german government registered 127,000 cases of germans moving abroad , though many more pick up and leave without informing the authorities of their decision . " it 's always the strongest , the most mobile , and those most open to risk-taking that go , " summarized klaus bade , professor at the institute for migration research and intercultural studies -lrb- imis -rrb- in osnabrück .
" and the tendency is rising . " every year , thousands of germans also return home from extended periods abroad , but their numbers are n't enough to balance the growing numbers of emigrants . labor migrants , expatriates , the " de-naturalized " - germans have several names for those who move abroad in search of work .
many of them are highly-qualified academics who choose to research and experiment in the united states or canada .
overseas , a regular headhunt for top qualified workers from germany has begun . " it 's absurd , " said bade .
" we 're exporting top workers to the west , and we 're importing tractor drivers and dairy farmers from the east . " opportunities and risks moving abroad has many advantages - a bigger salary , for example .
a teacher in buenos aires earns twice as much as a teacher in berlin .
in foreign cultures , there 's often more respect and recognition associated with certain jobs , as well as a faster climb up the career ladder .
not to mention the benefits that come with learning about a new culture . " the attraction has definitely grown stronger , " said bade , adding that unlike earlier emigrants , germans who move abroad today tend to stay longer in their new home . but living abroad also has its pitfalls , such as cultural misunderstandings .
in japan , for example , employees who fail to nod off in the middle of a meeting give the impression they 're not working hard enough .
and the direct way in which germans tend to handle negotiations is n't always appreciated . working abroad can also prove to be stressful for accompanying family members who suddenly have to adjust to unfamiliar food , new schools and foreign customs .
the longer and further afield expatriates go , the harder is the culture shock upon their return . brain drain in germany , the growing number of emigrants is cause for concern and intense debate over the effects this " brain drain " will have on the country .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .

at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .

many of them sent text messages that raised money for the victims of asia 's tsunami disaster . the party mood was darkened by berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who told the crowd at midnight : " today we know that we ca n't celebrate a joyful new year . " as a huge fireworks display lit up the skies over the german capital for 11 minutes , berliners and their compatriots ignored an appeal by foreign minister joschka fischer to give money to the asian relief fund instead of spending it on firecrackers , as the germans are wont to do for new year 's celebrations . despite the sadness caused by the tsunamis that killed some 125,000 people in the indian ocean region , including at least 34 germans , the bangs of firecrackers were matched by the pops of champagne corks .

by midnight at least € 333,000 had been collected . the berlin celebrations at the brandenburg gate , which features a giant fairground including a big wheel , are the biggest in germany . the traditional new year 's concert by the berlin philharmonic orchestra conducted by sir simon rattle raised € 50,000 for the asian fund .
taking part were american soprano sally matthews and tenor lawrence brownlee , and german baritone christian gerhaher . in his new year speech , chancellor gerhard schröder warned the nation to brace for more bad news .
" the terrible destruction means we must fear that several hundred germans will be among the dead , " he said in an advance copy of the speech .

but saying goodbye is n't always easy . in 2003 , the german government registered 127,000 cases of germans moving abroad , though many more pick up and leave without informing the authorities of their decision . " it 's always the strongest , the most mobile , and those most open to risk-taking that go , " summarized klaus bade , professor at the institute for migration research and intercultural studies -lrb- imis -rrb- in osnabrück .
" and the tendency is rising . " every year , thousands of germans also return home from extended periods abroad , but their numbers are n't enough to balance the growing numbers of emigrants . labor migrants , expatriates , the " de-naturalized " - germans have several names for those who move abroad in search of work .
many of them are highly-qualified academics who choose to research and experiment in the united states or canada .
overseas , a regular headhunt for top qualified workers from germany has begun . " it 's absurd , " said bade .
" we 're exporting top workers to the west , and we 're importing tractor drivers and dairy farmers from the east . " opportunities and risks moving abroad has many advantages - a bigger salary , for example .
a teacher in buenos aires earns twice as much as a teacher in berlin .
in foreign cultures , there 's often more respect and recognition associated with certain jobs , as well as a faster climb up the career ladder .
not to mention the benefits that come with learning about a new culture . " the attraction has definitely grown stronger , " said bade , adding that unlike earlier emigrants , germans who move abroad today tend to stay longer in their new home . but living abroad also has its pitfalls , such as cultural misunderstandings .
in japan , for example , employees who fail to nod off in the middle of a meeting give the impression they 're not working hard enough .
and the direct way in which germans tend to handle negotiations is n't always appreciated . working abroad can also prove to be stressful for accompanying family members who suddenly have to adjust to unfamiliar food , new schools and foreign customs .

from jan .
1 , 2005 , things have changed for foreigners . the catalyst for germany 's first immigration law was the realization that the country 's graying population and declining birth rate will one day threaten to overwhelm social security systems and disrupt the economy if young people did n't immigrate to the country . at the same time , the new law represents a political compromise by not unrestrainedly throwing open the labor market to immigrants .
in light of the country 's high unemployment rate , many politicians were wary of doing that , much to the ire of german companies . thus , foreigners from non-eu countries will still be denied access to simple jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.01.2005 auf wiedersehen , germany ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more germans are taking off in search of new career prospects more and more germans are turning their backs on the economic problems plaguing their homeland in the hopes of better pay and working conditions in foreign countries .
but saying goodbye is n't always easy . in 2003 , the german government registered 127,000 cases of germans moving abroad , though many more pick up and leave without informing the authorities of their decision . " it 's always the strongest , the most mobile , and those most open to risk-taking that go , " summarized klaus bade , professor at the institute for migration research and intercultural studies -lrb- imis -rrb- in osnabrück .
" and the tendency is rising . " every year , thousands of germans also return home from extended periods abroad , but their numbers are n't enough to balance the growing numbers of emigrants . labor migrants , expatriates , the " de-naturalized " - germans have several names for those who move abroad in search of work .
many of them are highly-qualified academics who choose to research and experiment in the united states or canada .
overseas , a regular headhunt for top qualified workers from germany has begun . " it 's absurd , " said bade .
" we 're exporting top workers to the west , and we 're importing tractor drivers and dairy farmers from the east . " opportunities and risks moving abroad has many advantages - a bigger salary , for example .
a teacher in buenos aires earns twice as much as a teacher in berlin .
in foreign cultures , there 's often more respect and recognition associated with certain jobs , as well as a faster climb up the career ladder .
not to mention the benefits that come with learning about a new culture . " the attraction has definitely grown stronger , " said bade , adding that unlike earlier emigrants , germans who move abroad today tend to stay longer in their new home . but living abroad also has its pitfalls , such as cultural misunderstandings .
in japan , for example , employees who fail to nod off in the middle of a meeting give the impression they 're not working hard enough .
and the direct way in which germans tend to handle negotiations is n't always appreciated . working abroad can also prove to be stressful for accompanying family members who suddenly have to adjust to unfamiliar food , new schools and foreign customs .
the longer and further afield expatriates go , the harder is the culture shock upon their return . brain drain in germany , the growing number of emigrants is cause for concern and intense debate over the effects this " brain drain " will have on the country .
for klaus bade , though , an even more urgent problem is the lack of any exact , representative figures . statistics on the number of germans moving abroad do not take into account the profession of the people in question .
therefore , no one knows for sure how many physicists need to be brought into the country to replace those who have moved abroad .
" when it comes to immigration , germany is flying blind , " said bade . tina gerhäusser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preparing to help abroad while relief workers rushing to asia to help deal with the aftermath of the tsunamis will have little time to interact with locals , aid workers who spend more time abroad require special intercultural skills .

from jan .
1 , 2005 , things have changed for foreigners . the catalyst for germany 's first immigration law was the realization that the country 's graying population and declining birth rate will one day threaten to overwhelm social security systems and disrupt the economy if young people did n't immigrate to the country . at the same time , the new law represents a political compromise by not unrestrainedly throwing open the labor market to immigrants .
in light of the country 's high unemployment rate , many politicians were wary of doing that , much to the ire of german companies . thus , foreigners from non-eu countries will still be denied access to simple jobs .
but , they can make use of special regulations - such as temporary contracts for seasonal workers and nursing personnel - to work in germany .

the government has earmarked over € 200 million towards that purpose . the authorities may also force foreigners already living in germany to participate in the courses or forfeit their residence permits or social handouts . such courses were previously only offered to ethnic germans , most of whom immigrated from the former soviet union .
the new law requires ethnic germans as well as their family members to pass a language test before they will be allowed to move to germany . changes for refugees the law also brings small improvements for refugees by being more specific on the recognition of non-state and gender-specific persecution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.01.2005 first german immigration law takes effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners already living in germany also face changes after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .
from jan .
1 , 2005 , things have changed for foreigners . the catalyst for germany 's first immigration law was the realization that the country 's graying population and declining birth rate will one day threaten to overwhelm social security systems and disrupt the economy if young people did n't immigrate to the country . at the same time , the new law represents a political compromise by not unrestrainedly throwing open the labor market to immigrants .
in light of the country 's high unemployment rate , many politicians were wary of doing that , much to the ire of german companies . thus , foreigners from non-eu countries will still be denied access to simple jobs .
but , they can make use of special regulations - such as temporary contracts for seasonal workers and nursing personnel - to work in germany .
even job-seekers from the ten countries that joined the eu in may this year will have to be patient : only after seven years will they be permitted to look for jobs in germany on their own . a question of qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian computer specialist harianto wijaya , 25 , right , presents his " green card " to the media however , highly-qualified immigrants will get a better deal , regardless of where they come from .
according to the green card regulation initiated in 2000 , foreign computer experts had to leave germany after five years .
the new law allows them to stay permanently .
foreign graduates of german universities will have a year to look for a job here if they want to stay in the country . the new immigration regulation also welcomes self-employed immigrants - provided they invest a minimum of € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- and create 10 new jobs .
the law also tackles a crucial deterrent to highly-qualified immigrants : bureaucracy .
people who wish to work in germany will thus receive a work and residence permit at one central place , such as the german embassy in their home country . german for newcomers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drawing lessons from the past , lawmakers also instilled in the regulation measures meant to improve integration in the face of widespread beliefs that a large number of the roughly 7.3 million foreigners living in germany have not adjusted socially to their adopted country . starting next year , new immigrants will have the right to participate in state-funded german language classes and receive an introduction to the country 's justice system , culture and history .
the government has earmarked over € 200 million towards that purpose . the authorities may also force foreigners already living in germany to participate in the courses or forfeit their residence permits or social handouts . such courses were previously only offered to ethnic germans , most of whom immigrated from the former soviet union .
the new law requires ethnic germans as well as their family members to pass a language test before they will be allowed to move to germany . changes for refugees the law also brings small improvements for refugees by being more specific on the recognition of non-state and gender-specific persecution .
refugees from countries that can not provide protection from persecution will have the right to asylum , including women who fear genital mutilation in their home countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the law does n't afford an overall right of residence for rejected asylum-seekers who have lived in germany a long time .
they will face deportation , despite refugee organizations ' efforts . only a small portion of the around 20,000 rejected asylum-seekers a year will profit from the law .
those who have already lived in germany for five years and can not be deported for legal reasons - if they can expect to be tortured in their home countries , for instance - will receive a limited residence permit . individual german states may now decide on a case-by-case basis against deportation .
such decisions will be taken by special commissions that include representatives from the churches as well as the office for foreigners .
with the exception of bavaria , lower saxony and bremen , all german states have said they will set up such commissions in 2005 . deporting terror suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors shout during a demonstration against the court decision on islamic leader muhammed metin kaplan in cologne the law is also meant to keep suspected foreign terrorists from legally immigrating to germany .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .

the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .

" we are now counting new pledges by the hour .
we 're now between $ 1.1 billion -lrb- € 813 million -rrb- and $ 1.2 billion , " the un 's emergency relief coordinator , jan egeland , told reporters in new york before japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi pledged $ 500 million in grant aid for the countries badly affected by the disaster . the un is organizing a donor conference that will take place on jan .

flash floods crippled relief work in eastern sri lanka saturday dealing a double blow to tsunami survivors as another 14,000 people were reported missing apart from the nearly 29,000 confirmed dead .
at least 15 tsunami refugee camps were flooded after heavy overnight rains dumped 330 millimeters -lrb- 13 inches -rrb- of water over the coastal region which was the hardest hit in last week 's disaster , chief local administrator herath abeyweera said . abeyweera , who was in ampara , 350 kilometers -lrb- 218 miles -rrb- east of the capital , colombo , said most of the access roads to the coastal district had been cut off by flooding that has also damaged several key bridges .
he said a team of 20 japanese medical staff was unable to move out to camps that were four feet -lrb- 1.2 meters -rrb- under water while all relief convoys were also held up by the river flooding . bildunterschrift : a man covers his nose to avoid the stench of corpses near a village destroyed by the tidal waves in banda aceh , indonesia aid workers around the region continued to bury thousands of victims as quickly as possible to control the spread of disease as exposed bodies decay in the heat and humidity .
authorities say many survivors of the tsunamis could die from dysentery , cholera and typhoid fever caused by contaminated food and water .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has warned that disease could end up killing as many people as the tidal wave itself . germany 's bundeswehr sent personnel to indonesia saturday to pave the way for a military hospital it plans to set up in the badly affected aceh province . missing tourists the foreign ministry in berlin was bracing on saturday for a death toll that could rank as the worst loss of german life since world war ii . " hope weakens day by day , " foreign ministry state secretary klaus scharioth said . some 5,000 foreign tourists , among them more than 1,000 germans , were listed as missing on saturday . the foreign ministry in berlin reported that 34 germans have been confirmed killed by the tsunami .
though that number has not increased for days , scharioth said that did n't necessarily mean the end was in sight .
instead , he said , merely collecting samples from corpses for dna analysis would require days . more than 2,230 foreign tourists perished in the floods . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder expects hundreds of dead hundreds of germans have probably died as a result of the tsunami in southern asia , german chancellor gerhard schröder said on wednesday , describing it as the " worst catastrophe in living memory .

from jan .
1 , 2005 , things have changed for foreigners . the catalyst for germany 's first immigration law was the realization that the country 's graying population and declining birth rate will one day threaten to overwhelm social security systems and disrupt the economy if young people did n't immigrate to the country . at the same time , the new law represents a political compromise by not unrestrainedly throwing open the labor market to immigrants .
in light of the country 's high unemployment rate , many politicians were wary of doing that , much to the ire of german companies . thus , foreigners from non-eu countries will still be denied access to simple jobs .
but , they can make use of special regulations - such as temporary contracts for seasonal workers and nursing personnel - to work in germany .

according to the green card regulation initiated in 2000 , foreign computer experts had to leave germany after five years .
the new law allows them to stay permanently .
foreign graduates of german universities will have a year to look for a job here if they want to stay in the country . the new immigration regulation also welcomes self-employed immigrants - provided they invest a minimum of € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- and create 10 new jobs .
the law also tackles a crucial deterrent to highly-qualified immigrants : bureaucracy .

the government has earmarked over € 200 million towards that purpose . the authorities may also force foreigners already living in germany to participate in the courses or forfeit their residence permits or social handouts . such courses were previously only offered to ethnic germans , most of whom immigrated from the former soviet union .
the new law requires ethnic germans as well as their family members to pass a language test before they will be allowed to move to germany . changes for refugees the law also brings small improvements for refugees by being more specific on the recognition of non-state and gender-specific persecution .

those who have already lived in germany for five years and can not be deported for legal reasons - if they can expect to be tortured in their home countries , for instance - will receive a limited residence permit . individual german states may now decide on a case-by-case basis against deportation .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons could a warning have saved lives ? schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunamis to further burden reinsurers reader response -pipe- 01.01.2005 tsunami disaster brings generosity back to first page back 2/2 on the need for an early warning system a warning and education about the potential for tsunami after a strong earthquake would have resulted in far , far fewer deaths and injuries most certainly .
people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .
finally , the problems and this disaster happened everywhere and to everybody , no matter where you come from . - carlos alfonso cortes bautista , bogota , colombia back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .
they 're also collecting donations to stem the crisis .
-lrb- dec .
29 , 2004 -rrb- german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .
-lrb- dec .
27 , 2004 -rrb- tsunami death toll could reach 150,000 aid pledges for asia 's tsunami victims topped $ 1.6 billion saturday , but the un warned it would take weeks for help to reach many survivors and that the death toll would likely rise to 150,000 .

from jan .
1 , 2005 , things have changed for foreigners . the catalyst for germany 's first immigration law was the realization that the country 's graying population and declining birth rate will one day threaten to overwhelm social security systems and disrupt the economy if young people did n't immigrate to the country . at the same time , the new law represents a political compromise by not unrestrainedly throwing open the labor market to immigrants .
in light of the country 's high unemployment rate , many politicians were wary of doing that , much to the ire of german companies . thus , foreigners from non-eu countries will still be denied access to simple jobs .
but , they can make use of special regulations - such as temporary contracts for seasonal workers and nursing personnel - to work in germany .
even job-seekers from the ten countries that joined the eu in may this year will have to be patient : only after seven years will they be permitted to look for jobs in germany on their own . a question of qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian computer specialist harianto wijaya , 25 , right , presents his " green card " to the media however , highly-qualified immigrants will get a better deal , regardless of where they come from .

the new law allows them to stay permanently .
foreign graduates of german universities will have a year to look for a job here if they want to stay in the country . the new immigration regulation also welcomes self-employed immigrants - provided they invest a minimum of € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- and create 10 new jobs .

the government has earmarked over € 200 million towards that purpose . the authorities may also force foreigners already living in germany to participate in the courses or forfeit their residence permits or social handouts . such courses were previously only offered to ethnic germans , most of whom immigrated from the former soviet union .
the new law requires ethnic germans as well as their family members to pass a language test before they will be allowed to move to germany . changes for refugees the law also brings small improvements for refugees by being more specific on the recognition of non-state and gender-specific persecution .

though that number has not increased for days , scharioth said that did n't necessarily mean the end was in sight .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .
finally , the problems and this disaster happened everywhere and to everybody , no matter where you come from . - carlos alfonso cortes bautista , bogota , colombia back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .

but saying goodbye is n't always easy . in 2003 , the german government registered 127,000 cases of germans moving abroad , though many more pick up and leave without informing the authorities of their decision . " it 's always the strongest , the most mobile , and those most open to risk-taking that go , " summarized klaus bade , professor at the institute for migration research and intercultural studies -lrb- imis -rrb- in osnabrück .
" and the tendency is rising . " every year , thousands of germans also return home from extended periods abroad , but their numbers are n't enough to balance the growing numbers of emigrants . labor migrants , expatriates , the " de-naturalized " - germans have several names for those who move abroad in search of work .
many of them are highly-qualified academics who choose to research and experiment in the united states or canada .
overseas , a regular headhunt for top qualified workers from germany has begun . " it 's absurd , " said bade .
" we 're exporting top workers to the west , and we 're importing tractor drivers and dairy farmers from the east . " opportunities and risks moving abroad has many advantages - a bigger salary , for example .
a teacher in buenos aires earns twice as much as a teacher in berlin .
in foreign cultures , there 's often more respect and recognition associated with certain jobs , as well as a faster climb up the career ladder .
not to mention the benefits that come with learning about a new culture . " the attraction has definitely grown stronger , " said bade , adding that unlike earlier emigrants , germans who move abroad today tend to stay longer in their new home . but living abroad also has its pitfalls , such as cultural misunderstandings .
in japan , for example , employees who fail to nod off in the middle of a meeting give the impression they 're not working hard enough .
and the direct way in which germans tend to handle negotiations is n't always appreciated . working abroad can also prove to be stressful for accompanying family members who suddenly have to adjust to unfamiliar food , new schools and foreign customs .
the longer and further afield expatriates go , the harder is the culture shock upon their return . brain drain in germany , the growing number of emigrants is cause for concern and intense debate over the effects this " brain drain " will have on the country .
for klaus bade , though , an even more urgent problem is the lack of any exact , representative figures . statistics on the number of germans moving abroad do not take into account the profession of the people in question .
therefore , no one knows for sure how many physicists need to be brought into the country to replace those who have moved abroad .
" when it comes to immigration , germany is flying blind , " said bade . tina gerhäusser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preparing to help abroad while relief workers rushing to asia to help deal with the aftermath of the tsunamis will have little time to interact with locals , aid workers who spend more time abroad require special intercultural skills .

on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .

our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .
congratulations , germany . - nina go to the next page to read comments on the need for early warning systems . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .

from jan .
1 , 2005 , things have changed for foreigners . the catalyst for germany 's first immigration law was the realization that the country 's graying population and declining birth rate will one day threaten to overwhelm social security systems and disrupt the economy if young people did n't immigrate to the country . at the same time , the new law represents a political compromise by not unrestrainedly throwing open the labor market to immigrants .
in light of the country 's high unemployment rate , many politicians were wary of doing that , much to the ire of german companies . thus , foreigners from non-eu countries will still be denied access to simple jobs .
but , they can make use of special regulations - such as temporary contracts for seasonal workers and nursing personnel - to work in germany .
even job-seekers from the ten countries that joined the eu in may this year will have to be patient : only after seven years will they be permitted to look for jobs in germany on their own . a question of qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian computer specialist harianto wijaya , 25 , right , presents his " green card " to the media however , highly-qualified immigrants will get a better deal , regardless of where they come from .

the new law allows them to stay permanently .
foreign graduates of german universities will have a year to look for a job here if they want to stay in the country . the new immigration regulation also welcomes self-employed immigrants - provided they invest a minimum of € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- and create 10 new jobs .
the law also tackles a crucial deterrent to highly-qualified immigrants : bureaucracy .

the government has earmarked over € 200 million towards that purpose . the authorities may also force foreigners already living in germany to participate in the courses or forfeit their residence permits or social handouts . such courses were previously only offered to ethnic germans , most of whom immigrated from the former soviet union .
the new law requires ethnic germans as well as their family members to pass a language test before they will be allowed to move to germany . changes for refugees the law also brings small improvements for refugees by being more specific on the recognition of non-state and gender-specific persecution .

those who have already lived in germany for five years and can not be deported for legal reasons - if they can expect to be tortured in their home countries , for instance - will receive a limited residence permit . individual german states may now decide on a case-by-case basis against deportation .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .
congratulations , germany . - nina go to the next page to read comments on the need for early warning systems . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .
finally , the problems and this disaster happened everywhere and to everybody , no matter where you come from . - carlos alfonso cortes bautista , bogota , colombia back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .

many of them sent text messages that raised money for the victims of asia 's tsunami disaster . the party mood was darkened by berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who told the crowd at midnight : " today we know that we ca n't celebrate a joyful new year . " as a huge fireworks display lit up the skies over the german capital for 11 minutes , berliners and their compatriots ignored an appeal by foreign minister joschka fischer to give money to the asian relief fund instead of spending it on firecrackers , as the germans are wont to do for new year 's celebrations . despite the sadness caused by the tsunamis that killed some 125,000 people in the indian ocean region , including at least 34 germans , the bangs of firecrackers were matched by the pops of champagne corks .
as in other european capitals , security was tight around the brandenburg gate with some 800 policemen and hundreds of firemen and paramedics , but no " notable incidents " were reported . donations via cell phone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian and simon decher raise their glasses to celebrate the beginning of 2005 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .

by midnight at least € 333,000 had been collected . the berlin celebrations at the brandenburg gate , which features a giant fairground including a big wheel , are the biggest in germany . the traditional new year 's concert by the berlin philharmonic orchestra conducted by sir simon rattle raised € 50,000 for the asian fund .
taking part were american soprano sally matthews and tenor lawrence brownlee , and german baritone christian gerhaher . in his new year speech , chancellor gerhard schröder warned the nation to brace for more bad news .
" the terrible destruction means we must fear that several hundred germans will be among the dead , " he said in an advance copy of the speech .
schröder also said his government would push for indian ocean nations caught up in the devastation to receive debt relief from wealthy countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships chancellor gerhard schröder has used his annual new year 's speech to widen his appeal for debt reduction in the indian ocean countries devastated by sunday 's earthquake and tsunami .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .

26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .

the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .

the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .
congratulations , germany . - nina go to the next page to read comments on the need for early warning systems . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .

many of them sent text messages that raised money for the victims of asia 's tsunami disaster . the party mood was darkened by berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who told the crowd at midnight : " today we know that we ca n't celebrate a joyful new year . " as a huge fireworks display lit up the skies over the german capital for 11 minutes , berliners and their compatriots ignored an appeal by foreign minister joschka fischer to give money to the asian relief fund instead of spending it on firecrackers , as the germans are wont to do for new year 's celebrations . despite the sadness caused by the tsunamis that killed some 125,000 people in the indian ocean region , including at least 34 germans , the bangs of firecrackers were matched by the pops of champagne corks .

" the terrible destruction means we must fear that several hundred germans will be among the dead , " he said in an advance copy of the speech .

many of them sent text messages that raised money for the victims of asia 's tsunami disaster . the party mood was darkened by berlin mayor klaus wowereit , who told the crowd at midnight : " today we know that we ca n't celebrate a joyful new year . " as a huge fireworks display lit up the skies over the german capital for 11 minutes , berliners and their compatriots ignored an appeal by foreign minister joschka fischer to give money to the asian relief fund instead of spending it on firecrackers , as the germans are wont to do for new year 's celebrations . despite the sadness caused by the tsunamis that killed some 125,000 people in the indian ocean region , including at least 34 germans , the bangs of firecrackers were matched by the pops of champagne corks .
as in other european capitals , security was tight around the brandenburg gate with some 800 policemen and hundreds of firemen and paramedics , but no " notable incidents " were reported . donations via cell phone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian and simon decher raise their glasses to celebrate the beginning of 2005 in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin .

by midnight at least € 333,000 had been collected . the berlin celebrations at the brandenburg gate , which features a giant fairground including a big wheel , are the biggest in germany . the traditional new year 's concert by the berlin philharmonic orchestra conducted by sir simon rattle raised € 50,000 for the asian fund .
taking part were american soprano sally matthews and tenor lawrence brownlee , and german baritone christian gerhaher . in his new year speech , chancellor gerhard schröder warned the nation to brace for more bad news .
" the terrible destruction means we must fear that several hundred germans will be among the dead , " he said in an advance copy of the speech .
schröder also said his government would push for indian ocean nations caught up in the devastation to receive debt relief from wealthy countries . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships chancellor gerhard schröder has used his annual new year 's speech to widen his appeal for debt reduction in the indian ocean countries devastated by sunday 's earthquake and tsunami .

but saying goodbye is n't always easy . in 2003 , the german government registered 127,000 cases of germans moving abroad , though many more pick up and leave without informing the authorities of their decision . " it 's always the strongest , the most mobile , and those most open to risk-taking that go , " summarized klaus bade , professor at the institute for migration research and intercultural studies -lrb- imis -rrb- in osnabrück .
" and the tendency is rising . " every year , thousands of germans also return home from extended periods abroad , but their numbers are n't enough to balance the growing numbers of emigrants . labor migrants , expatriates , the " de-naturalized " - germans have several names for those who move abroad in search of work .
many of them are highly-qualified academics who choose to research and experiment in the united states or canada .
overseas , a regular headhunt for top qualified workers from germany has begun . " it 's absurd , " said bade .
" we 're exporting top workers to the west , and we 're importing tractor drivers and dairy farmers from the east . " opportunities and risks moving abroad has many advantages - a bigger salary , for example .
a teacher in buenos aires earns twice as much as a teacher in berlin .
in foreign cultures , there 's often more respect and recognition associated with certain jobs , as well as a faster climb up the career ladder .
not to mention the benefits that come with learning about a new culture . " the attraction has definitely grown stronger , " said bade , adding that unlike earlier emigrants , germans who move abroad today tend to stay longer in their new home . but living abroad also has its pitfalls , such as cultural misunderstandings .
in japan , for example , employees who fail to nod off in the middle of a meeting give the impression they 're not working hard enough .
and the direct way in which germans tend to handle negotiations is n't always appreciated . working abroad can also prove to be stressful for accompanying family members who suddenly have to adjust to unfamiliar food , new schools and foreign customs .
the longer and further afield expatriates go , the harder is the culture shock upon their return . brain drain in germany , the growing number of emigrants is cause for concern and intense debate over the effects this " brain drain " will have on the country .
for klaus bade , though , an even more urgent problem is the lack of any exact , representative figures . statistics on the number of germans moving abroad do not take into account the profession of the people in question .
therefore , no one knows for sure how many physicists need to be brought into the country to replace those who have moved abroad .
" when it comes to immigration , germany is flying blind , " said bade . tina gerhäusser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preparing to help abroad while relief workers rushing to asia to help deal with the aftermath of the tsunamis will have little time to interact with locals , aid workers who spend more time abroad require special intercultural skills .

flash floods crippled relief work in eastern sri lanka saturday dealing a double blow to tsunami survivors as another 14,000 people were reported missing apart from the nearly 29,000 confirmed dead .
at least 15 tsunami refugee camps were flooded after heavy overnight rains dumped 330 millimeters -lrb- 13 inches -rrb- of water over the coastal region which was the hardest hit in last week 's disaster , chief local administrator herath abeyweera said . abeyweera , who was in ampara , 350 kilometers -lrb- 218 miles -rrb- east of the capital , colombo , said most of the access roads to the coastal district had been cut off by flooding that has also damaged several key bridges .
he said a team of 20 japanese medical staff was unable to move out to camps that were four feet -lrb- 1.2 meters -rrb- under water while all relief convoys were also held up by the river flooding . bildunterschrift : a man covers his nose to avoid the stench of corpses near a village destroyed by the tidal waves in banda aceh , indonesia aid workers around the region continued to bury thousands of victims as quickly as possible to control the spread of disease as exposed bodies decay in the heat and humidity .
authorities say many survivors of the tsunamis could die from dysentery , cholera and typhoid fever caused by contaminated food and water .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has warned that disease could end up killing as many people as the tidal wave itself . germany 's bundeswehr sent personnel to indonesia saturday to pave the way for a military hospital it plans to set up in the badly affected aceh province . missing tourists the foreign ministry in berlin was bracing on saturday for a death toll that could rank as the worst loss of german life since world war ii . " hope weakens day by day , " foreign ministry state secretary klaus scharioth said . some 5,000 foreign tourists , among them more than 1,000 germans , were listed as missing on saturday . the foreign ministry in berlin reported that 34 germans have been confirmed killed by the tsunami .
though that number has not increased for days , scharioth said that did n't necessarily mean the end was in sight .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .
finally , the problems and this disaster happened everywhere and to everybody , no matter where you come from . - carlos alfonso cortes bautista , bogota , colombia back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .

our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .
his humanitarian approach to debt relief , both pre- and post-tsunami , is commendable .
unlike our businessman president , bush , mr schröder sees himself as a world citizen .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .

26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .

people would not have been surprised and curious about what was happening .
even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .
finally , the problems and this disaster happened everywhere and to everybody , no matter where you come from . - carlos alfonso cortes bautista , bogota , colombia back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .

even if they knew there had just been a strong earthquake they would have not been caught totally off-guard .
and the locals should have been more aware of how deadly these waves can be and this would have made them move out of harms way .
with no warning they were sitting ducks .
it is so sad to see so much destruction that could have been avoided had people had a clue .
even if people knew there was an earthquake they could decide for themselves that there would be a chance for a tsunami if ever so slight .
i know i would not be lying on the beach tanning had i known .
i am lucky to be living in a place where we have been close to a tsunami in 1964 and now have a warning system in place .
however , i would never expect this to be fail-proof either but it is better than being oblivious .
i am sure the tourists there just assume that there would be an emergency warning system in place like back in their own countries . - barbara thomae yes , -lrb- an early warning system -rrb- would make a difference in saving thousands of lives that are gone .
it 's hard to say whom to blame for the thousands of lost lives , but those countries ' governments are some -lrb- way -rrb- responsible for not at least warning people to get away from coasts .
another thing is the lack of education .
i believe this could have saved lives .
unfortunately our countries are not rich or wealthy -lrb- enough -rrb- to afford a warning system but they 're always ready for corruption . - susann i think that an early warning would 've made a big difference in the death toll .
if after the earthquake there had been between 20 and 2 hours for the tsunami to build , and there had been an efficient warning system , it would have been possible to save many lives by evacuating at least the people who lived closest to the sea shores .
natural disasters can not be avoided , so this should be a reason to be alert and take into account it can happen anywhere , anytime . - tatiana , costa rica while early warnings may have caused some fear and panic , the rapid exodus of people might have saved a few thousand lives .
given the level of global observation technology in a variety of fields it is shameful that so little effort is given to saving human lives .
early warning systems exist elsewhere in the world .
these should be expanded and enhanced . - ron luft yes , an early warning system could have helped to save a lot of life in many countries .
together with such a system , awareness on where to move to be safe is required . - aminath shafia even 20 minutes warning could have saved thousands of lives , areas were warnings could have been hours in advance could have an even greater difference .
however , we must consider that this was an unthinkable disaster .
nothing on this scale has happened before and particularly not in this area , so how many warning systems for how many types of disasters should be installed and at what cost ?
finally , some of the areas are so technologically and educationally behind , once the scientists know what was likely to happen , how do you get that word to the common person on the street ?
we can second guess everything after the fact , 20/20 hindsight .
yes , warnings could have saved thousands , but if this had not happened would anyone think of warnings for tsunamis there ?
it was a tragedy and nobody should feel that they should have prevented it . - pamela teitel-werdath do you think an early warning would have made a difference ? 1,000 percent yes .
world governments say the cost of setting up a global tsunami warning system costs too much .
the war in iraq ' cost ' too much financially and in innocent lives lost .
with over 100,000 tsunami fatalities , there 's no excuse for not having a global warning system .
how can we put a ' cost ' value on the 100,000 plus people who died with no warning on what seemed like a beautiful day in paradise ?
we the people of the world all deserve the right to have a fair warning , even if it 's only 20 minutes .
if the governments ca n't get together and put a warning system in place then we the people must start our own fund to get the warning system in place because sadly , this tragedy will happen again . - a.l. , new york city i do n't know much about tsunamis , but i think that it happened because they do n't have the instruments and the contingency plans in case of an earthquake or something like that .
-lrb- the -rrb- problem is about the accessibility of poor countries to this technology .
finally , the problems and this disaster happened everywhere and to everybody , no matter where you come from . - carlos alfonso cortes bautista , bogota , colombia back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south asia donations and information international humanitarian organizations may be able to help you trace family in the regions affected by the devastating seaquake in south asia .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !

eyewitnesses comment we were on the tablamu golf course , close to khao lak , thailand when the waves came .
our lady caddies got us running to the next half-way house where we held on the steel beams .
our hotel mukdara beach resort in khao lak was destroyed , and we stood quite confused on the streets after spending the night up on the hills .
then a pick-up van stopped , our caddies from the day before recognized us .
they took us to their home , gave us food , let us shower , gave me clean clothes , even bought my husband new clothes and shoes as theirs did n't fit him .
they took us to phang nga deputy governor 's station , where we were given 500 bahts to go to phuket town .
our caddies took us to the bus station , paid for the tickets and insisted on us taking another 2000 bahts cash !
more than what they earn in a month !
they did n't even ask for our names or address .
at the phuket town hall there were numerous muti-lingual translators , free overseas calls and free internet , lots of food , water and first aid .
our caddies and other thai people helped us with unbelievable generosity and hospitality , although they had so little themselves !
we 're in their debt and we 'll definitely go back and do what we can for this wonderful people .
thank you so much ali , orrewan , nan and your family ! - susi ma i flew out to colombo on sunday , dec .
26 for a two week holiday with my british friend who is a resident there .
we were due to spend the first week in a yoga retreat between gaulle and hikkaduwa .
on my way to heathrow i expected sri lanka airways to have cancelled all its flights after i saw sky news that morning , but they had n't so i assumed it was n't all that bad out there .
the death toll when i left was 1,200 in asia .
by the time i landed in colombo i think the death toll had gone up to 10,000 or more .
it was a very tense flight there and a very tense moment meeting my friend at the airport .
we were picked up by locals who my friend already knew and were driven up to kandi which is inland and safe .
we have spent the last few days in a hotel there , but of course most of the holidaymakers have also made their way there so it was difficult to get a room in a hotel .
it seems there are quite a lot of westerners who decided not to go home and to seek refuge on higher ground inland .
life in kandi still goes on almost as if nothing has happened and completely unaffected .
the only change is that all locals and us tourists spend most of our time glued to sky news in the bars or hotels .
it 's a very somber mood here but i 'm planning on staying because i feel my friend could do with the company at this time and it 's very calm up here in the hills . - amanda glover on relief aid to the countries affected we in australia have pledged $ 35,000,000 and we have planes constantly flying in and out of the area .
i admit that australia is a wealthy country , but germany is a wealthy country as well .
i would expect a better financial response from your country than $ 2.7 million .
please , the world needs our help and i feel that germany should dig a little deeper and give for the sake of humanity . - gwyllym suter i think the world is just starting to respond .
a rough estimate of $ 100 million worldwide is pledged and help is moving .
as more needs are brought into focus , more help from all over the world will come . - john lynch though it can be fair enough to criticize the government and citizens of my united states for hard headedness and that our relief can be at times proportioned too strongly along lines drawn by political agenda , there is no question who will contribute most greatly to this relief effort .
can it be enough ?
impossible .
the suffering is monumental , the road is long and there was not enough sustenance in much of this region before this disaster .
nevertheless we will try , and the people of the indian ocean rim will learn what berliners learned in 1948 : that americans will drop everything and come running when needed , even to a place in which we might otherwise be personae non grata . - don shogren , wisconsin , usa the contributions from the german government and people is extremely disappointing considering it is the third largest economy in the world .
also , its citizens have a major presence in sri lanka , india and the other affected areas .
come on , germany - you can do much better ! - ken brookhouse i think that the us has been absolutely horrible to everyone over there .
yet , i 'll bet they prefer that the us not get involved for fear of them stomping all over everyone .
in contrast , nations like kenya have been exemplary in sending doctors and aid over immediately .
nobody had to create committees there to discuss the " situation " for six months before sending their planes over .
why could n't the us be more like that ?
i 'll bet the us soldiers stationed in iraq would have much preferred to have been sent to sri lanka and thailand , etc. to help set up refugee camps and distribute food and water purification tablets than fight people whose only crime is wanting the us to get out of their country -lrb- iraq -rrb- and leave them alone ! - lea-marie sky , usa schröder is right on track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.01.2005 first german immigration law takes effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners already living in germany also face changes after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .
from jan .
1 , 2005 , things have changed for foreigners . the catalyst for germany 's first immigration law was the realization that the country 's graying population and declining birth rate will one day threaten to overwhelm social security systems and disrupt the economy if young people did n't immigrate to the country . at the same time , the new law represents a political compromise by not unrestrainedly throwing open the labor market to immigrants .
in light of the country 's high unemployment rate , many politicians were wary of doing that , much to the ire of german companies . thus , foreigners from non-eu countries will still be denied access to simple jobs .
but , they can make use of special regulations - such as temporary contracts for seasonal workers and nursing personnel - to work in germany .
even job-seekers from the ten countries that joined the eu in may this year will have to be patient : only after seven years will they be permitted to look for jobs in germany on their own . a question of qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian computer specialist harianto wijaya , 25 , right , presents his " green card " to the media however , highly-qualified immigrants will get a better deal , regardless of where they come from .
according to the green card regulation initiated in 2000 , foreign computer experts had to leave germany after five years .
the new law allows them to stay permanently .
foreign graduates of german universities will have a year to look for a job here if they want to stay in the country . the new immigration regulation also welcomes self-employed immigrants - provided they invest a minimum of € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- and create 10 new jobs .
the law also tackles a crucial deterrent to highly-qualified immigrants : bureaucracy .
people who wish to work in germany will thus receive a work and residence permit at one central place , such as the german embassy in their home country . german for newcomers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drawing lessons from the past , lawmakers also instilled in the regulation measures meant to improve integration in the face of widespread beliefs that a large number of the roughly 7.3 million foreigners living in germany have not adjusted socially to their adopted country . starting next year , new immigrants will have the right to participate in state-funded german language classes and receive an introduction to the country 's justice system , culture and history .
the government has earmarked over € 200 million towards that purpose . the authorities may also force foreigners already living in germany to participate in the courses or forfeit their residence permits or social handouts . such courses were previously only offered to ethnic germans , most of whom immigrated from the former soviet union .
the new law requires ethnic germans as well as their family members to pass a language test before they will be allowed to move to germany . changes for refugees the law also brings small improvements for refugees by being more specific on the recognition of non-state and gender-specific persecution .
refugees from countries that can not provide protection from persecution will have the right to asylum , including women who fear genital mutilation in their home countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the law does n't afford an overall right of residence for rejected asylum-seekers who have lived in germany a long time .
they will face deportation , despite refugee organizations ' efforts . only a small portion of the around 20,000 rejected asylum-seekers a year will profit from the law .
those who have already lived in germany for five years and can not be deported for legal reasons - if they can expect to be tortured in their home countries , for instance - will receive a limited residence permit . individual german states may now decide on a case-by-case basis against deportation .

from jan .
1 , 2005 , things have changed for foreigners . the catalyst for germany 's first immigration law was the realization that the country 's graying population and declining birth rate will one day threaten to overwhelm social security systems and disrupt the economy if young people did n't immigrate to the country . at the same time , the new law represents a political compromise by not unrestrainedly throwing open the labor market to immigrants .
in light of the country 's high unemployment rate , many politicians were wary of doing that , much to the ire of german companies . thus , foreigners from non-eu countries will still be denied access to simple jobs .
but , they can make use of special regulations - such as temporary contracts for seasonal workers and nursing personnel - to work in germany .
even job-seekers from the ten countries that joined the eu in may this year will have to be patient : only after seven years will they be permitted to look for jobs in germany on their own . a question of qualifications bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian computer specialist harianto wijaya , 25 , right , presents his " green card " to the media however , highly-qualified immigrants will get a better deal , regardless of where they come from .
according to the green card regulation initiated in 2000 , foreign computer experts had to leave germany after five years .
the new law allows them to stay permanently .
foreign graduates of german universities will have a year to look for a job here if they want to stay in the country . the new immigration regulation also welcomes self-employed immigrants - provided they invest a minimum of € 1 million -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- and create 10 new jobs .
the law also tackles a crucial deterrent to highly-qualified immigrants : bureaucracy .
people who wish to work in germany will thus receive a work and residence permit at one central place , such as the german embassy in their home country . german for newcomers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drawing lessons from the past , lawmakers also instilled in the regulation measures meant to improve integration in the face of widespread beliefs that a large number of the roughly 7.3 million foreigners living in germany have not adjusted socially to their adopted country . starting next year , new immigrants will have the right to participate in state-funded german language classes and receive an introduction to the country 's justice system , culture and history .
the government has earmarked over € 200 million towards that purpose . the authorities may also force foreigners already living in germany to participate in the courses or forfeit their residence permits or social handouts . such courses were previously only offered to ethnic germans , most of whom immigrated from the former soviet union .
the new law requires ethnic germans as well as their family members to pass a language test before they will be allowed to move to germany . changes for refugees the law also brings small improvements for refugees by being more specific on the recognition of non-state and gender-specific persecution .
refugees from countries that can not provide protection from persecution will have the right to asylum , including women who fear genital mutilation in their home countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the law does n't afford an overall right of residence for rejected asylum-seekers who have lived in germany a long time .
they will face deportation , despite refugee organizations ' efforts . only a small portion of the around 20,000 rejected asylum-seekers a year will profit from the law .
those who have already lived in germany for five years and can not be deported for legal reasons - if they can expect to be tortured in their home countries , for instance - will receive a limited residence permit . individual german states may now decide on a case-by-case basis against deportation .
such decisions will be taken by special commissions that include representatives from the churches as well as the office for foreigners .
with the exception of bavaria , lower saxony and bremen , all german states have said they will set up such commissions in 2005 . deporting terror suspects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors shout during a demonstration against the court decision on islamic leader muhammed metin kaplan in cologne the law is also meant to keep suspected foreign terrorists from legally immigrating to germany .

now cabinet papers released by the national archives provide inside detail of just how bad the relationship had become between prime minister harold wilson , his officials and mr benn within months of labour taking power in 1974 .
mr benn , who retired from the house of commons in 2001 , has documented the period extensively in his diaries .
but the downing street documents reveal how much some officials opposed mr benn 's radical agenda .
returning to government as industry secretary after labour 's narrow win in march 1974 , mr benn soon recorded his relationship with wilson had hit " absolutely rock bottom " .
the two men clashed fundamentally on key policy areas , including labour 's relationship with the unions once in government .
mr benn believed in increasing " workers ' control " of industry and pushed this policy as soon as he was in office .
official fears the response from his enemies was ferocious - one political cartoon in the sunday express depicted mr benn as an undertaker burying british industry . "
the way you put it will simply be grist to the mill for those who say we are controlled by the unions ... -lsb- it will -rsb- undermine at a stroke all that some of us have been doing to try to rebuild a measure of confidence in industry " harold wilson to tony benn senior official sir robert armstrong , later to become cabinet secretary under lady thatcher , alerted mr wilson that mr benn was nevertheless planning to make a speech on this policy in early may .
the draft seen by sir robert was full of language considered marxist by benn 's critics : it described strike action as an historical " struggle for the industrial franchise " which would see a " real transfer of power .
" plans submitted by britain 's leading companies will have to be developed in conjunction with the workpeople , " proposed mr benn .
key to this future was following through on labour 's commitment to nationalisation - clause four of the party 's constitution which was later dropped by tony blair .
in a memo sir robert told harold wilson the speech would be politically disastrous .
' heady stuff ' " this is a good deal toned down from an earlier version ... but it is still heady stuff and some of it is likely to send special shivers down industrial spines , " he said .
joe haines , mr wilson 's influential press secretary , agreed .
" tony 's speech will cause uproar without advancing his cause , " he warned .
the prime minister decided to order the cabinet minister to rewrite the speech .
in his diaries , mr benn briefly records his row with officials over the speech - but not wilson 's furious letter .
mr wilson said : " i do n't think you can make a speech like this ... it goes a long way beyond anything that we are committed to as a cabinet or a government .
" you have no authority to say ' the government accepts that commitment ' -lsb- to clause four -rsb- .
" none of us has had an opportunity of thinking about , let alone discussing your ideas .
benn and wilson " my relations with harold are absolutely rock bottom - i will have to consider how to improve them , he really does think that my public statements and so on are destroying the labour party " tony benn 's diary , 19 may 1974 " as it is , the way you put it will simply be grist to the mill for those who say we are controlled by the unions ... -lsb- it will -rsb- undermine at a stroke all that some of us have been doing to try to rebuild a measure of confidence in industry . "
shortly before the planned speech , mr benn 's office sent a third version of the text back to downing street , with key sections red-inked out .
read by sir robert armstrong again , the top civil servant thought it was now just about passable .
" the eyes still flash but the feet do not tingle quite so heavily , " he told the prime minister .
mr wilson appeared satisfied and allowed the matter to drop .
but his rebellious cabinet minister was not entirely prepared to toe the line .
within weeks he had sparked more fury in downing street when he abstained on a minor technical vote in the commons , something colleagues took as a signal of his dogged refusal to do as he was told .

now cabinet papers released by the national archives provide inside detail of just how bad the relationship had become between prime minister harold wilson , his officials and mr benn within months of labour taking power in 1974 .
mr benn , who retired from the house of commons in 2001 , has documented the period extensively in his diaries .
but the downing street documents reveal how much some officials opposed mr benn 's radical agenda .
returning to government as industry secretary after labour 's narrow win in march 1974 , mr benn soon recorded his relationship with wilson had hit " absolutely rock bottom " .
the two men clashed fundamentally on key policy areas , including labour 's relationship with the unions once in government .
mr benn believed in increasing " workers ' control " of industry and pushed this policy as soon as he was in office .
official fears the response from his enemies was ferocious - one political cartoon in the sunday express depicted mr benn as an undertaker burying british industry .
the way you put it will simply be grist to the mill for those who say we are controlled by the unions ... -lsb- it will -rsb- undermine at a stroke all that some of us have been doing to try to rebuild a measure of confidence in industry harold wilson to tony benn senior official sir robert armstrong , later to become cabinet secretary under lady thatcher , alerted mr wilson that mr benn was nevertheless planning to make a speech on this policy in early may .
the draft seen by sir robert was full of language considered marxist by benn 's critics : it described strike action as an historical " struggle for the industrial franchise " which would see a " real transfer of power .
" plans submitted by britain 's leading companies will have to be developed in conjunction with the workpeople , " proposed mr benn .
key to this future was following through on labour 's commitment to nationalisation - clause four of the party 's constitution which was later dropped by tony blair .
in a memo sir robert told harold wilson the speech would be politically disastrous .
' heady stuff ' " this is a good deal toned down from an earlier version ... but it is still heady stuff and some of it is likely to send special shivers down industrial spines , " he said .
harold wilson : benn admitted their relationship collapsed joe haines , mr wilson 's influential press secretary , agreed .
" tony 's speech will cause uproar without advancing his cause , " he warned .
the prime minister decided to order the cabinet minister to rewrite the speech .
in his diaries , mr benn briefly records his row with officials over the speech - but not wilson 's furious letter .
mr wilson said : " i do n't think you can make a speech like this ... it goes a long way beyond anything that we are committed to as a cabinet or a government .
" you have no authority to say ' the government accepts that commitment ' -lsb- to clause four -rsb- .
" none of us has had an opportunity of thinking about , let alone discussing your ideas .
benn and wilson my relations with harold are absolutely rock bottom - i will have to consider how to improve them , he really does think that my public statements and so on are destroying the labour party tony benn 's diary , 19 may 1974 " as it is , the way you put it will simply be grist to the mill for those who say we are controlled by the unions ... -lsb- it will -rsb- undermine at a stroke all that some of us have been doing to try to rebuild a measure of confidence in industry . "
shortly before the planned speech , mr benn 's office sent a third version of the text back to downing street , with key sections red-inked out .
read by sir robert armstrong again , the top civil servant thought it was now just about passable .
" the eyes still flash but the feet do not tingle quite so heavily , " he told the prime minister .
mr wilson appeared satisfied and allowed the matter to drop .
but his rebellious cabinet minister was not entirely prepared to toe the line .
within weeks he had sparked more fury in downing street when he abstained on a minor technical vote in the commons , something colleagues took as a signal of his dogged refusal to do as he was told .

optimists believe the elections scheduled for january will prove a milestone 2005 does not hold out much hope of an improvement , although there are still some optimists around who feel that the elections on 30 january will prove a milestone .
the problem in 2004 was that neither of the two main strands of american policy worked .
neither politics nor security took hold .
power was formally handed over to an interim government at the end of june but this government failed to develop popular legitimacy , especially in the heartland of the insurgency , the sunni areas of central iraq .
distrust on the security front , things went from bad in 2003 to worse in 2004 .
the insurgents , whether nationalist or islamic , gained in strength and even took over the city of falluja .
the abu ghraib scandal left many iraqis still distrusting us troops iraqi security forces and police proved hopelessly inadequate .
kidnappings and videotaped beheadings moved from nightmarish fears to reality .
prisoner abuse at abu ghraib provided lasting images of brutality .

optimists believe the elections scheduled for january will prove a milestone 2005 does not hold out much hope of an improvement , although there are still some optimists around who feel that the elections on 30 january will prove a milestone .
the problem in 2004 was that neither of the two main strands of american policy worked .
neither politics nor security took hold .
power was formally handed over to an interim government at the end of june but this government failed to develop popular legitimacy , especially in the heartland of the insurgency , the sunni areas of central iraq .
distrust on the security front , things went from bad in 2003 to worse in 2004 .
the insurgents , whether nationalist or islamic , gained in strength and even took over the city of falluja .
the abu ghraib scandal left many iraqis still distrusting us troops iraqi security forces and police proved hopelessly inadequate .
kidnappings and videotaped beheadings moved from nightmarish fears to reality .
prisoner abuse at abu ghraib provided lasting images of brutality .
this left the us occupation troops isolated .
and they are too few and too distrusted to do the job .
the only bright spot was in the south where shia unrest was quelled .
the shias are biding their time for the election in which they expect their majority to prevail .
the former british representative to the coalition authority , sir jeremy greenstock , who a year ago was talking about iraq being dangerous but " do-able " , is now sounding much more pessimistic .
he believes that while there has been political progress , the lack of security " has let everything down . "
we are leaving political structures but iraqis do not see the improvements that would have brought their support sir jeremy greenstock , former british representative to the ica " mistakes were made and the insurgency was underestimated , " he said .
" the biggest mistake was to allow a security vacuum to develop .
it motivated insurgents and gave them opportunities to get weapons and get new people in .
" the security vacuum is irremediable at the moment .
foreign forces will not be able to eradicate the violence .
the iraqis themselves will have to do that .
the insurgents at present can be chased out of one place only to emerge in another .
they are ineradicable unless iraqi society as a whole actively turns against them . "
credibility blow his analysis is that the iraqis would have had the patience to wait for the new political structures to work if they had seen improvements in their daily lives .
" we are leaving political structures but iraqis do not see the improvements that would have brought their support , " he said .
security forces are frequent targets for iraqi insurgents sir jeremy concluded that in 2004 the united states had " lost credibility in the eyes of iraqis and the region " .
" this year the worst thing has been the steady leak of that credibility .
abu ghraib dealt an enormous blow , " he said .
one reason for the failure on the security front was the inadequacy of iraqi forces .
2004 was supposed to be the year in which they came into their own .
however , the center for strategic and international studies in washington has tracked this issue throughout the year and , in december 2004 , its analyst anthony cordesman concluded that the result was " to leave many iraqi forces without anything approaching adequate organisation , training , equipment and facilities . "
he said in his report that " for political and other reasons , the -lsb- bush -rsb- administration , the cpa -lsb- coalition provisional authority -rsb- and us command emphasised quantity over quality to the point where unprepared iraqis were sent out to die . "
bad planning mr cordesman also came to wider conclusions : " the report documents a tragic us failure to develop a strategy during the first year of its occupation of iraq .
it is a failure to understand the strategic situation in iraq and the realities of iraqi politics .
it is a failure at every level to prepare for a co-ordinated us effort at nation building . "
ayatollah sistani may well be the man to watch in 2005 michael o 'hanlon , an analyst at another us think-tank , the brookings institution , was even more scathing .
in an article for the hoover institution 's policy review , he said : " one of the most brilliant invasion successes in modern military history was followed almost immediately by one of the most incompetently planned occupations . "
so what of 2005 ?
a great deal is riding on the election .
this is for a " transitional national assembly " .
it will select the government and prepare a constitution upon which further elections will be held at the end of the year .
in some quarters , the election is being portrayed like the roll of the dice that could solve all problems .
however , it is unlikely to be that simple .
rosemary hollis , of the royal institute for international affairs in london , says the risk is that those supporting the insurgency will either not vote or will be marginalised by the shia majority .
" elections might , therefore , not solve the problem of the insurgency , " she said .
this fear is also shared by senior british officials , although they phrase it more delicately .
one , just back from a visit to iraq , said the priority in 2005 would be to " ensure that the views of all elements are reflected in the constitution .
that can not just depend on the outcome of the election . "
' brave decisions ' the official retained some hope from the attitude of the leading shia cleric ayatollah sistani .
the ayatollah has called on the shias to vote and has unified many of their factions .
but he has also spoken of the need to respect other traditions .
ayatollah sistani might well be the man to watch in 2005 .
if , however , the election simply encourages the divisions of the country , then a break-up into its three parts - shia , sunni and kurd - can not be ruled out .
an optimistic note was struck by jonathan paris of st antony 's college , oxford .
he still believes in the so-called " j-curve " effect , in which things go downhill before they start climbing again .
" we are nearing the bottom of the curve .
i stand by it .
i am cautiously optimistic that if the election goes well , things will turn out all right , " he said .
sir jeremy greenstock said : " one has to be very realistic .
iraqis have to keep going and need to take brave decisions .
they do not have any real political alternative .
only they can take on the violence in their communities .
having in place a government which they have elected themselves might help them make that decision .
" it depends on the iraqis .
we have lost the primary control . "
he summed up the prospects : " the train is wobbly but it is still on the track . "

britain 's first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise .
in the 20 years since that day , mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 % of britons own a handset .
mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline .
slow growth the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched .
the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked .
the first call was made from st katherine 's dock to vodafone 's head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house .
for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk .
then on 10 january cellnet -lrb- now o2 -rrb- launched its service .
mike caudwell , spokesman for vodafone , said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase , cost about £ 2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes .
in 1986 phones were big , bulky and black " despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s , " he said .
" they became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk . "
this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on .
he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million .
" it 's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people , " he said .
" cellnet was forecasting half that . "
now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone .
cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one -lrb- now t-mobile -rrb- was launched .
orange had its uk launch in 1994 .
both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology .
the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired .
called global system for mobiles -lrb- gsm -rrb- this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls .
mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things , such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular .
