a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .
but whether it is just doodling or art is a question an exhibition in nuremberg is hoping to shed light on . gone are the days when the rage of the young men of the ' 68 generation would lead them to smearing political slogans on fences and walls during the night .
these days , the subversives are n't as concerned with the day 's political issues , rather , they prefer running around making creations that lie in the grey area between art and property destruction . one finds them on sides of building , on overpasses and trains - and now , in nuremberg 's main library .
they 're shrill , glowing , colorful and alive . " graffitti is half art , that is undisputable , " said siegfried leykamm , who has assembled this collection .
" and many museums are interested in these graffiti artists .
it is not considered art only because anything done outside lawful means usually is n't , no ' ifs ' ' ands ' or ' buts ' . " at the beginning is a " corpora delicti , " a 40 square-meter wood display of spray paint cans and pictures in a " legal " graffiti action .
covered with abstract figures , the board shows the exhibits off effectively .
it functions as the anchor to the 150 photographs of graffiti works , most of which come from the franconia region in southern germany . bildunterschrift : hard to prevent meaningless labels or ornaments in one , a dog pees , deceptively real , almost like in a trompe l 'oeil .
on a another wall , a comic-like bear sporting a crown grins and a monster tries to make the viewer jump in terror .
sometimes , ornamental initials appearing on train cars or factory walls are elegant and curved ; other times other times they are just meaningless jumbles . the pictures in the exposition are not computer-generated photos but actual reproductions of real work .
when interior minister otto schilly recently came up with an idea to use helicopters and infrared cameras to catch graffiti artists , leykamm says it was a bit of overkill . there are other ways to control graffiti , he adds : one has to find a dialogue between the authorities and the graffiti enthusiasts because with a ban and arrests and prosecutions , one wo n't solve anything . graffitti for centuries graffiti is not a modern-day phenomenon .
vikings drew pictures and scribbled little messages about themselves or their loves on sacred ancient burial sites after invading north scotland .
in this exhibition , there are photos of centuries-old scribblings etched on a 1516 built grain house belonging to a religious order - directly behind the police station there today . tomas senne -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grappling with graffiti 's darker side when it comes to graffiti , one man 's art is another man 's vandalism .

" the growing authority of neo-nazis and the ever firmer foothold they have in german public life worries us , " he said .
" there is the danger that the growth of neo-nazism could postpone the end of the post-war period and prevent us distancing ourselves from the war . "
" we must fight against any neo-nazi words at an early stage , before they can spread and take hold , " katsav stressed .

" the relations between our two countries have been through some difficult times which we have overcome .
we both know that in the next 40 years these relations will not be entirely normal and as clear as with other countries , " katsav added .
on wednesday , katsav will visit the new memorial in central berlin dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
the israeli president said israel is concerned by signs of anti-semitism in germany , but recognized official determination to fight it .
köhler had assured katsav that germany was making every effort to fight anti-semitism , especially by teaching children about the murder of six million jews by the nazis .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

" the united states announced monday that it will file a request for the establishment of a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- dispute settlement panel to resolve the dispute .
the panel request will be filed on tuesday , may 31 , " the ustr statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson the us complaint was announced here as a spokeswoman for european union trade chief peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- said monday that mandelson had written to his us counterparts with a fresh proposal to resolve the transatlantic row over subsidies for airplane makers airbus and boeing . illegal aid the simmering dispute over aid to airbus and boeing has become inflamed lately after airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . " for almost a year , the united states has tried to convince the eu to negotiate an end to subsidies for large civil aircraft , " us trade representative rob portman said in the statement .
" so we were pleased when , on jan .
11 of this year , the eu agreed to a standstill on launch aid while we negotiated an end to subsidies .
unfortunately , at this point , the eu is no longer willing to hold off on launch aid , and has only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them . " a balanced approach meanwhile , in brussels , mandelson 's spokeswoman claude veron-reville said earlier monday that the eu trade chief 's proposal renews a call for a balanced approach to the dispute .

the panel request will be filed on tuesday , may 31 , " the ustr statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson the us complaint was announced here as a spokeswoman for european union trade chief peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- said monday that mandelson had written to his us counterparts with a fresh proposal to resolve the transatlantic row over subsidies for airplane makers airbus and boeing . illegal aid the simmering dispute over aid to airbus and boeing has become inflamed lately after airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . " for almost a year , the united states has tried to convince the eu to negotiate an end to subsidies for large civil aircraft , " us trade representative rob portman said in the statement .
" so we were pleased when , on jan .
11 of this year , the eu agreed to a standstill on launch aid while we negotiated an end to subsidies .
unfortunately , at this point , the eu is no longer willing to hold off on launch aid , and has only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them . " a balanced approach meanwhile , in brussels , mandelson 's spokeswoman claude veron-reville said earlier monday that the eu trade chief 's proposal renews a call for a balanced approach to the dispute . " peter mandelson is making it clear what we are ready to do and this is why he has made a fresh proposal , " she said .
" he has repeated our proposal and that we are willing to negotiate rather than go the wto . " the ustr said that by requesting the arbitration panel , washington is providing time for the eu to reconsider its plans to provide new subsidies and recommit to the deal struck in january . " this would include an immediate halt to any further steps toward providing new launch aid and a recommitment that the purpose of the negotiations is to end new subsidies for large civil aircraft -lrb- lca -rrb- , and not merely to reduce them , " the ustr said . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " portman said , noting that out of the 100 concluded wto cases involving the us since the wto was founded , over a third were satisfactorily resolved following negotiation .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " months of negotiation the eu and the us have been trying for months to negotiate an agreement to end their dispute over commercial aviation , to avoid taking the case down the perilous wto route . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington insists that over its 35-year history , airbus has benefited from massive amounts of member state and eu subsidies that have enabled the company to create a full product line of aircraft and gain a 50-percent share of large civilian aircraft sales and a 60 percent share of the global order book . every major airbus aircraft model , they argue , was financed , in whole or in part , with eu government subsidies taking the form of " launch aid " - financing with no or low rates of interest , and repayment tied to sales of the aircraft . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us spar over new airbus aid the european union said thursday it still hopes to resolve a row with the united states over aircraft subsidies without resorting to legal action , despite a new aid request by airbus which risks re-igniting the dispute .
-lrb- may 19 , 2005 -rrb- airbus giant soars into history books the airbus a380 , the biggest airliner ever built , completed a momentous maiden flight on wednesday , winning praise across europe as a " magnificent machine " and opening a new era in aviation history .

" we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution , while the us was planning last week to take this issue to the wto , " he told reuters .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us did n't act in good faith , he says the move pits washington and brussels squarely against each other in a months-long dispute that escalated after an april 11 deadline passed without a resolution .
on monday , the us filed suit against airbus and now , the european countermove , raises the stakes in the transatlantic dispute over state aid for aircraft giants boeing and airbus . the wto 's 148 members can face huge penalties if they are found to have breached the rules of global commerce and then fail to fall into line with its decisions . the wto said it received washington 's complaint on tuesday and that an initial hearing was scheduled for june 13 to set up a dispute settlement panel . the panel could take until 2006 to rule on the dispute , and with possible appeals by either side , a final decision may come even later . eu disappointed with us move after a visit to the wto 's geneva headquarters on tuesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said he was disappointed by the us move against airbus , which has overtaken boeing to lead the global civilian aircraft market . " airbus 's success is well earned , " mandelson told afp .
" it 's won through hard work , high technology and huge creativity , not by subsidies as boeing would like to pretend .
this decision is highly regrettable from the standpoint of all those who believe that the wto has better things to do with its time than referee this grudge fight of boeing against airbus . " the eu and us first filed requests for consultations at the wto in october - the formal opening shot in the wto 's dispute procedures - but later agreed to freeze the process as they tried to reach a settlement . washington 's wto complaint was announced shortly after mandelson had made a fresh proposal to resolve the dispute by trimming state aid to both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : number two now eu promised subsidies reduction on tuesday , mandelson hinted that he believed the us had acted in bad faith .

" we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " he said .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " washington had decided to take the case to the wto because that was the best way to prevent the aircraft dispute from spilling over into other tussles on steel duties and biotechnology , portman 's office said . on monday , after washington 's announcement , mandelson and portman had issued a joint statement . dispute will not affect other areas of cooperation " we remain united in our determination that this dispute shall not affect our cooperation on wider bilateral and multilateral trade issues , " they said .
" we have worked together well so far , and intend to continue to do so . " the dispute over aid to airbus and boeing was inflamed lately when airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal under wto rules , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us seeks arbitration over airbus subsidies the us will ask the world trade organization tuesday to create an arbitration panel to resolve a dispute over european subsidies to aircraft maker airbus , the us trade representative said in a statement .

" we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution , while the us was planning last week to take this issue to the wto , " he told reuters .
" this decision is highly regrettable for those that think the wto has better things to do with its time than referee a grudge fight . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us did n't act in good faith , he says the move pits washington and brussels squarely against each other in a months-long dispute that escalated after an april 11 deadline passed without a resolution .
on monday , the us filed suit against airbus and now , the european countermove , raises the stakes in the transatlantic dispute over state aid for aircraft giants boeing and airbus . the wto 's 148 members can face huge penalties if they are found to have breached the rules of global commerce and then fail to fall into line with its decisions . the wto said it received washington 's complaint on tuesday and that an initial hearing was scheduled for june 13 to set up a dispute settlement panel . the panel could take until 2006 to rule on the dispute , and with possible appeals by either side , a final decision may come even later . eu disappointed with us move after a visit to the wto 's geneva headquarters on tuesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said he was disappointed by the us move against airbus , which has overtaken boeing to lead the global civilian aircraft market .

" the united states announced monday that it will file a request for the establishment of a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- dispute settlement panel to resolve the dispute .
the panel request will be filed on tuesday , may 31 , " the ustr statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson the us complaint was announced here as a spokeswoman for european union trade chief peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- said monday that mandelson had written to his us counterparts with a fresh proposal to resolve the transatlantic row over subsidies for airplane makers airbus and boeing . illegal aid the simmering dispute over aid to airbus and boeing has become inflamed lately after airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . " for almost a year , the united states has tried to convince the eu to negotiate an end to subsidies for large civil aircraft , " us trade representative rob portman said in the statement .
" so we were pleased when , on jan .
11 of this year , the eu agreed to a standstill on launch aid while we negotiated an end to subsidies .
unfortunately , at this point , the eu is no longer willing to hold off on launch aid , and has only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them . " a balanced approach meanwhile , in brussels , mandelson 's spokeswoman claude veron-reville said earlier monday that the eu trade chief 's proposal renews a call for a balanced approach to the dispute . " peter mandelson is making it clear what we are ready to do and this is why he has made a fresh proposal , " she said .
" he has repeated our proposal and that we are willing to negotiate rather than go the wto . " the ustr said that by requesting the arbitration panel , washington is providing time for the eu to reconsider its plans to provide new subsidies and recommit to the deal struck in january . " this would include an immediate halt to any further steps toward providing new launch aid and a recommitment that the purpose of the negotiations is to end new subsidies for large civil aircraft -lrb- lca -rrb- , and not merely to reduce them , " the ustr said . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " portman said , noting that out of the 100 concluded wto cases involving the us since the wto was founded , over a third were satisfactorily resolved following negotiation .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies .

recent political events in france and germany underscore the weakness of the alliance provides the motor of europe 's economy .
is the eu polticially hamstrung ? france 's rejection of the eu constitution strikes a further damaging blow to its already waning influence in the bloc , only a week after long-time eu partner germany was thrown into turmoil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite schröder 's campaigning in toulouse for french ratification of the eu constitution , the ' no 's had it .
indeed , the french " no " vote sunday and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's defeat in a key state election the previous weekend threaten an all-out stall for europe 's already sputtering franco-german motor .
" what the result means is that the franco-german axis is in serious trouble .
it 's the end of a phase which began in 2002 , " said charles powell , senior researcher at the elcano royal institute think tank in madrid .
cabinet reshuffle : de villepin as premier less than half an hour after the rejection of the treaty , aimed at improving decision making in the 25-member bloc , was announced , even an embarrassed french president jacques chirac acknowledged there would be trouble ahead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dominique de villepin and chirac he promised to defend the country before eu leaders at their summit on june 16-17 , but added , " let us make no mistake , france 's decision inevitably creates a difficult context for the defense of our interests in europe . "
on tuesday , chirac also reacted to the vote by appointing dominique de villepin as his new prime minister in a major government reshuffle .
villepin , the 51-year-old former foreign minister who earned a worldwide reputation for his impassioned defense of france 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , replaces the deeply unpopular jean-pierre raffarin . raffarin was named prime minister in 2002 , upon president jacques chirac 's re-election to a second term .
villepin had served as the country 's interior minister until tuesday .
chirac , like many french citizens , is extremely proud of france 's role as a founding member of an integrated europe .
other eu states have rejected treaties - denmark said no to the maastricht treaty in 1992 , and ireland initially snubbed the nice treaty in 2001 - but france is another matter .
lack of sympathy " france is complicating the construction of europe .
so there is no reason for anyone to feel any particular sympathy for the country , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
across the border and the political spectrum , schröder has been leading the other half of the eu 's driving force , but he has been severely weakened by an election reversal in germany 's most populous state this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu flag this coupled with economic strife and high unemployment , as in france , has forced him to put his job on the line through snap national polls expected possibly as soon as september .
" we ca n't expect any major impulse for europe from this duo soon , " said henrik uterwedde , deputy diretor at the german-french institute in ludwigsburg , germany .
they have lost the " ability to attract majorities " for their proposals .
waning political power according to alfred grosser , a french political science and history expert , chirac and schröder have been widely discredited by recent events .
" they will be severely weakened in the eyes of the other member states at the european union summit in mid-june , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac campaigned in favor of ratification , to no avail the german parliament finally ratified the treaty on friday , while the french people decided whether it should be adopted .
but uterwedde said the choice of methods had made a great deal of difference .
" the fears that surfaced during the debate in france are not foreign to us , " he said .
had a referendum taken place in germany " the discussion would have gone exactly the same way . "
" europe is broken down " but according to french foreign minister michel barnier , the vote on sunday sent his country off on a different path to that of its eastern neighbor .
" this is the first time in 50 years that the french and germans have diverged in europe on a fundamental issue , " he said on french television .
" without this constitution , europe is broken down politically . "
barnier added the franco-german concept of the eu is in danger of being replaced by a " much more liberal europe , one big supermarket . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu politicians react to french " non " politicians from across the spectrum were quick to comment on the defeat in france of the proposed eu constitution .
after a bitter campaign , opponents to the charter garnered 55 percent of the vote on sunday .
-lrb- may 30 , 2005 -rrb- franco-german ties after a french " non " if french voters do indeed reject the draft eu constitution in sunday 's referendum , the european union will likely be catapulted into a crisis and franco-german relations may suffer serious damage .
-lrb- may 25 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

" we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution , while the us was planning last week to take this issue to the wto , " he told reuters .
" this decision is highly regrettable for those that think the wto has better things to do with its time than referee a grudge fight . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us did n't act in good faith , he says the move pits washington and brussels squarely against each other in a months-long dispute that escalated after an april 11 deadline passed without a resolution .
on monday , the us filed suit against airbus and now , the european countermove , raises the stakes in the transatlantic dispute over state aid for aircraft giants boeing and airbus . the wto 's 148 members can face huge penalties if they are found to have breached the rules of global commerce and then fail to fall into line with its decisions . the wto said it received washington 's complaint on tuesday and that an initial hearing was scheduled for june 13 to set up a dispute settlement panel . the panel could take until 2006 to rule on the dispute , and with possible appeals by either side , a final decision may come even later . eu disappointed with us move after a visit to the wto 's geneva headquarters on tuesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said he was disappointed by the us move against airbus , which has overtaken boeing to lead the global civilian aircraft market . " airbus 's success is well earned , " mandelson told afp .
" it 's won through hard work , high technology and huge creativity , not by subsidies as boeing would like to pretend .
this decision is highly regrettable from the standpoint of all those who believe that the wto has better things to do with its time than referee this grudge fight of boeing against airbus .

" i think it is as well for the world to know that we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution while the united states was planning to take this matter to the wto , " he said . on monday , us trade representative rob portman said in a statement , however , that washington was unhappy because the eu had " only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them , " thereby not tackling us concerns head on and forcing washington 's hand . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " he said .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " washington had decided to take the case to the wto because that was the best way to prevent the aircraft dispute from spilling over into other tussles on steel duties and biotechnology , portman 's office said . on monday , after washington 's announcement , mandelson and portman had issued a joint statement . dispute will not affect other areas of cooperation " we remain united in our determination that this dispute shall not affect our cooperation on wider bilateral and multilateral trade issues , " they said .
" we have worked together well so far , and intend to continue to do so . " the dispute over aid to airbus and boeing was inflamed lately when airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal under wto rules , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us seeks arbitration over airbus subsidies the us will ask the world trade organization tuesday to create an arbitration panel to resolve a dispute over european subsidies to aircraft maker airbus , the us trade representative said in a statement .

" we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution , while the us was planning last week to take this issue to the wto , " he told reuters .
" this decision is highly regrettable for those that think the wto has better things to do with its time than referee a grudge fight . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us did n't act in good faith , he says the move pits washington and brussels squarely against each other in a months-long dispute that escalated after an april 11 deadline passed without a resolution .
on monday , the us filed suit against airbus and now , the european countermove , raises the stakes in the transatlantic dispute over state aid for aircraft giants boeing and airbus . the wto 's 148 members can face huge penalties if they are found to have breached the rules of global commerce and then fail to fall into line with its decisions . the wto said it received washington 's complaint on tuesday and that an initial hearing was scheduled for june 13 to set up a dispute settlement panel . the panel could take until 2006 to rule on the dispute , and with possible appeals by either side , a final decision may come even later . eu disappointed with us move after a visit to the wto 's geneva headquarters on tuesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said he was disappointed by the us move against airbus , which has overtaken boeing to lead the global civilian aircraft market . " airbus 's success is well earned , " mandelson told afp .
" it 's won through hard work , high technology and huge creativity , not by subsidies as boeing would like to pretend .
this decision is highly regrettable from the standpoint of all those who believe that the wto has better things to do with its time than referee this grudge fight of boeing against airbus . " the eu and us first filed requests for consultations at the wto in october - the formal opening shot in the wto 's dispute procedures - but later agreed to freeze the process as they tried to reach a settlement . washington 's wto complaint was announced shortly after mandelson had made a fresh proposal to resolve the dispute by trimming state aid to both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : number two now eu promised subsidies reduction on tuesday , mandelson hinted that he believed the us had acted in bad faith . " i think it is as well for the world to know that we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution while the united states was planning to take this matter to the wto , " he said . on monday , us trade representative rob portman said in a statement , however , that washington was unhappy because the eu had " only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them , " thereby not tackling us concerns head on and forcing washington 's hand . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " he said .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " washington had decided to take the case to the wto because that was the best way to prevent the aircraft dispute from spilling over into other tussles on steel duties and biotechnology , portman 's office said . on monday , after washington 's announcement , mandelson and portman had issued a joint statement . dispute will not affect other areas of cooperation " we remain united in our determination that this dispute shall not affect our cooperation on wider bilateral and multilateral trade issues , " they said .
" we have worked together well so far , and intend to continue to do so . " the dispute over aid to airbus and boeing was inflamed lately when airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal under wto rules , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us seeks arbitration over airbus subsidies the us will ask the world trade organization tuesday to create an arbitration panel to resolve a dispute over european subsidies to aircraft maker airbus , the us trade representative said in a statement .

" we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution , while the us was planning last week to take this issue to the wto , " he told reuters .
" this decision is highly regrettable for those that think the wto has better things to do with its time than referee a grudge fight . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us did n't act in good faith , he says the move pits washington and brussels squarely against each other in a months-long dispute that escalated after an april 11 deadline passed without a resolution .
on monday , the us filed suit against airbus and now , the european countermove , raises the stakes in the transatlantic dispute over state aid for aircraft giants boeing and airbus . the wto 's 148 members can face huge penalties if they are found to have breached the rules of global commerce and then fail to fall into line with its decisions . the wto said it received washington 's complaint on tuesday and that an initial hearing was scheduled for june 13 to set up a dispute settlement panel . the panel could take until 2006 to rule on the dispute , and with possible appeals by either side , a final decision may come even later . eu disappointed with us move after a visit to the wto 's geneva headquarters on tuesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said he was disappointed by the us move against airbus , which has overtaken boeing to lead the global civilian aircraft market . " airbus 's success is well earned , " mandelson told afp .
" it 's won through hard work , high technology and huge creativity , not by subsidies as boeing would like to pretend .
this decision is highly regrettable from the standpoint of all those who believe that the wto has better things to do with its time than referee this grudge fight of boeing against airbus . " the eu and us first filed requests for consultations at the wto in october - the formal opening shot in the wto 's dispute procedures - but later agreed to freeze the process as they tried to reach a settlement . washington 's wto complaint was announced shortly after mandelson had made a fresh proposal to resolve the dispute by trimming state aid to both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : number two now eu promised subsidies reduction on tuesday , mandelson hinted that he believed the us had acted in bad faith . " i think it is as well for the world to know that we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution while the united states was planning to take this matter to the wto , " he said . on monday , us trade representative rob portman said in a statement , however , that washington was unhappy because the eu had " only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them , " thereby not tackling us concerns head on and forcing washington 's hand . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " he said .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " washington had decided to take the case to the wto because that was the best way to prevent the aircraft dispute from spilling over into other tussles on steel duties and biotechnology , portman 's office said . on monday , after washington 's announcement , mandelson and portman had issued a joint statement . dispute will not affect other areas of cooperation " we remain united in our determination that this dispute shall not affect our cooperation on wider bilateral and multilateral trade issues , " they said .
" we have worked together well so far , and intend to continue to do so . " the dispute over aid to airbus and boeing was inflamed lately when airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal under wto rules , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us seeks arbitration over airbus subsidies the us will ask the world trade organization tuesday to create an arbitration panel to resolve a dispute over european subsidies to aircraft maker airbus , the us trade representative said in a statement .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .

" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy .

" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .

-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust .

the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

" we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

under the aegis of the stasi archive - named the birthler behörde after its director , marianne birthler - a research group is now concluding work on what experts believe is the definitive source on east germany 's infamous secret police , handed back over to germany by the cia in 2003 . allegedly , it contains a few surprises .
in an interview with the magazine mut , project leader helmut müller-enbergs revealed that in the late 1980s , up to 18 secret agents with the stasi 's center for foreign espionage -lrb- hva -rrb- were active in the west german foreign ministry . west german universities were also infiltrated with informers more densely than previously believed , with 43 spies operating at berlin 's free university , and another 12 at the technical university .
as well as containing names of west germans working for the stasi , the report also lists some 20,000 to 30,000 east germans working unofficially as stasi informers in the four decades up to the fall of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " clearly , a file like this can clear up a lot of mysteries , " said christian booss , spokesperson with the birthler behörde . " when the rosewood file came to light , a lot of authorities decided that on the basis of its findings they 'd take a last opportunity before the statute of limitations runs out in 2006 to screen civil servants .

its task was to investigate the extent of the stasi 's role in east german sport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a recent bundestag report presented by marianne birthler and dsb president manfred von richthofen confirmed , many feel that its mandate has been too limited - one key problem being that the commission can only investigate individuals in response to specific requests . academics , politicians and stasi victims have now joined forces to call for a more extensive probe , based on similar lines to the three-year investigation into communist infiltration of german public broadcaster ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giselher spitzer , a sports historian , is the initiator of the " berlin declaration , " a project set up in september 2004 by victims of stasi intrigue and doping which demands german sports organizations launch more stringent inquiries into east germany 's state-sanctioned manipulation of its sports industry . winfried hermann from the green party agrees that that the existing commission 's research has been inadequate . " white-washing the past is not fair to the victims of the problem , " he told die welt . still relevant and according to spitzer , the problem is still highly topical . " there is evidence to suggest that individuals who have been identified as stasi agents are returning to sports , " he said , pointing to examples of former collaborators who now hold senior positions in the north german soccer association -lrb- nofv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a highly controversial move , the interior ministry last year invited east germany 's former national team coach bernd stange -lrb- who went on to train the iraqi national team under saddam hussein -rrb- to a symposium in leipzig on the world cup 2006 .
according to the birthler behörde , stange -lrb- photo -rrb- was a stasi informer for 14 years . most recently , roland gehrke , trainer of the up-and-coming luckenwalde wrestling club , was revealed to have been an informer between 1977 and 1988 , allegedly passing on information about his colleagues ' extra-marital affairs , sexual orientation , drinking habits and political leanings . taking offendors to task spitzer maintains that by 1989 , the stasi had enlisted some 3,000 informers from within east germany 's sporting ranks .
how many of them are still working in the industry today is unknown , primarily because few authorities have ever initiated investigations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " according to german sports law , no one who worked for the stasi or treated athletes with steroids is allowed to hold a top position , " said spitzer , referring to the case of wolfgang nitschke , the trainer of the german wrestling team who was dismissed last november .
" the berlin declaration says that in cases of conflict , the state should withdraw funding from associations which fail to dismiss guilty parties . "
as it stands , associations prefer to turn a blind eye - for two reasons .
" on the one hand , there can never be complete certainty about just how dangerous agent activity was , " explained spitzer .
" and on the other hand , many of these trainers are key to sporting success and no one wants to see them dismissed . " " widespread lack of awareness means the issue continues to be treated as harmless , " he stressed .
" ultimately , that means that former stasi agents will be allowed to set the pace in german sports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on eastern germany museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany east german loses copyright battle over beloved traffic symbol a win-win situation for american investors in east germany eastern germany gets pep talk on wasting money germany -pipe- 31.05.2005 how the stasi rigged east german sports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 , the stasi destroyed 90 percent of its archives with the notorious rosewood file now lifting the lid on more stasi subterfuge , experts on gdr sports argue that it 's time former collaborators with east germany 's secret service were called to account . the " rosewood file " is something of a holy grail in the world of international espionage .
under the aegis of the stasi archive - named the birthler behörde after its director , marianne birthler - a research group is now concluding work on what experts believe is the definitive source on east germany 's infamous secret police , handed back over to germany by the cia in 2003 . allegedly , it contains a few surprises .
in an interview with the magazine mut , project leader helmut müller-enbergs revealed that in the late 1980s , up to 18 secret agents with the stasi 's center for foreign espionage -lrb- hva -rrb- were active in the west german foreign ministry . west german universities were also infiltrated with informers more densely than previously believed , with 43 spies operating at berlin 's free university , and another 12 at the technical university .
as well as containing names of west germans working for the stasi , the report also lists some 20,000 to 30,000 east germans working unofficially as stasi informers in the four decades up to the fall of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " clearly , a file like this can clear up a lot of mysteries , " said christian booss , spokesperson with the birthler behörde . " when the rosewood file came to light , a lot of authorities decided that on the basis of its findings they 'd take a last opportunity before the statute of limitations runs out in 2006 to screen civil servants .
most of the applications have come from cdu-ruled states in eastern german states - saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringen .
since early 2004 , we 've had over 100,000 requests . " stasi and sport among those getting hot under the collar could be numerous figures from the world of sport . in the mid-1990s , the national olympic committee and the german sport association -lrb- dsb -rrb- set up a commission made up of sport representatives , administrators and former ddr civil rights activists .
its task was to investigate the extent of the stasi 's role in east german sport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a recent bundestag report presented by marianne birthler and dsb president manfred von richthofen confirmed , many feel that its mandate has been too limited - one key problem being that the commission can only investigate individuals in response to specific requests . academics , politicians and stasi victims have now joined forces to call for a more extensive probe , based on similar lines to the three-year investigation into communist infiltration of german public broadcaster ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giselher spitzer , a sports historian , is the initiator of the " berlin declaration , " a project set up in september 2004 by victims of stasi intrigue and doping which demands german sports organizations launch more stringent inquiries into east germany 's state-sanctioned manipulation of its sports industry . winfried hermann from the green party agrees that that the existing commission 's research has been inadequate . " white-washing the past is not fair to the victims of the problem , " he told die welt . still relevant and according to spitzer , the problem is still highly topical . " there is evidence to suggest that individuals who have been identified as stasi agents are returning to sports , " he said , pointing to examples of former collaborators who now hold senior positions in the north german soccer association -lrb- nofv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a highly controversial move , the interior ministry last year invited east germany 's former national team coach bernd stange -lrb- who went on to train the iraqi national team under saddam hussein -rrb- to a symposium in leipzig on the world cup 2006 .
according to the birthler behörde , stange -lrb- photo -rrb- was a stasi informer for 14 years . most recently , roland gehrke , trainer of the up-and-coming luckenwalde wrestling club , was revealed to have been an informer between 1977 and 1988 , allegedly passing on information about his colleagues ' extra-marital affairs , sexual orientation , drinking habits and political leanings . taking offendors to task spitzer maintains that by 1989 , the stasi had enlisted some 3,000 informers from within east germany 's sporting ranks .
how many of them are still working in the industry today is unknown , primarily because few authorities have ever initiated investigations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " according to german sports law , no one who worked for the stasi or treated athletes with steroids is allowed to hold a top position , " said spitzer , referring to the case of wolfgang nitschke , the trainer of the german wrestling team who was dismissed last november .
" the berlin declaration says that in cases of conflict , the state should withdraw funding from associations which fail to dismiss guilty parties . "
as it stands , associations prefer to turn a blind eye - for two reasons .
" on the one hand , there can never be complete certainty about just how dangerous agent activity was , " explained spitzer .
" and on the other hand , many of these trainers are key to sporting success and no one wants to see them dismissed . " " widespread lack of awareness means the issue continues to be treated as harmless , " he stressed .
" ultimately , that means that former stasi agents will be allowed to set the pace in german sports . " jane paulick , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .

" the united states announced monday that it will file a request for the establishment of a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- dispute settlement panel to resolve the dispute .
the panel request will be filed on tuesday , may 31 , " the ustr statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson the us complaint was announced here as a spokeswoman for european union trade chief peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- said monday that mandelson had written to his us counterparts with a fresh proposal to resolve the transatlantic row over subsidies for airplane makers airbus and boeing . illegal aid the simmering dispute over aid to airbus and boeing has become inflamed lately after airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . " for almost a year , the united states has tried to convince the eu to negotiate an end to subsidies for large civil aircraft , " us trade representative rob portman said in the statement .
" so we were pleased when , on jan .
11 of this year , the eu agreed to a standstill on launch aid while we negotiated an end to subsidies .
unfortunately , at this point , the eu is no longer willing to hold off on launch aid , and has only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them . " a balanced approach meanwhile , in brussels , mandelson 's spokeswoman claude veron-reville said earlier monday that the eu trade chief 's proposal renews a call for a balanced approach to the dispute . " peter mandelson is making it clear what we are ready to do and this is why he has made a fresh proposal , " she said .
" he has repeated our proposal and that we are willing to negotiate rather than go the wto . " the ustr said that by requesting the arbitration panel , washington is providing time for the eu to reconsider its plans to provide new subsidies and recommit to the deal struck in january . " this would include an immediate halt to any further steps toward providing new launch aid and a recommitment that the purpose of the negotiations is to end new subsidies for large civil aircraft -lrb- lca -rrb- , and not merely to reduce them , " the ustr said . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " portman said , noting that out of the 100 concluded wto cases involving the us since the wto was founded , over a third were satisfactorily resolved following negotiation .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " months of negotiation the eu and the us have been trying for months to negotiate an agreement to end their dispute over commercial aviation , to avoid taking the case down the perilous wto route . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington insists that over its 35-year history , airbus has benefited from massive amounts of member state and eu subsidies that have enabled the company to create a full product line of aircraft and gain a 50-percent share of large civilian aircraft sales and a 60 percent share of the global order book . every major airbus aircraft model , they argue , was financed , in whole or in part , with eu government subsidies taking the form of " launch aid " - financing with no or low rates of interest , and repayment tied to sales of the aircraft . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us spar over new airbus aid the european union said thursday it still hopes to resolve a row with the united states over aircraft subsidies without resorting to legal action , despite a new aid request by airbus which risks re-igniting the dispute .

" this decision is highly regrettable for those that think the wto has better things to do with its time than referee a grudge fight . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us did n't act in good faith , he says the move pits washington and brussels squarely against each other in a months-long dispute that escalated after an april 11 deadline passed without a resolution .
on monday , the us filed suit against airbus and now , the european countermove , raises the stakes in the transatlantic dispute over state aid for aircraft giants boeing and airbus . the wto 's 148 members can face huge penalties if they are found to have breached the rules of global commerce and then fail to fall into line with its decisions . the wto said it received washington 's complaint on tuesday and that an initial hearing was scheduled for june 13 to set up a dispute settlement panel . the panel could take until 2006 to rule on the dispute , and with possible appeals by either side , a final decision may come even later . eu disappointed with us move after a visit to the wto 's geneva headquarters on tuesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said he was disappointed by the us move against airbus , which has overtaken boeing to lead the global civilian aircraft market . " airbus 's success is well earned , " mandelson told afp .
" it 's won through hard work , high technology and huge creativity , not by subsidies as boeing would like to pretend .
this decision is highly regrettable from the standpoint of all those who believe that the wto has better things to do with its time than referee this grudge fight of boeing against airbus . " the eu and us first filed requests for consultations at the wto in october - the formal opening shot in the wto 's dispute procedures - but later agreed to freeze the process as they tried to reach a settlement . washington 's wto complaint was announced shortly after mandelson had made a fresh proposal to resolve the dispute by trimming state aid to both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : number two now eu promised subsidies reduction on tuesday , mandelson hinted that he believed the us had acted in bad faith . " i think it is as well for the world to know that we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution while the united states was planning to take this matter to the wto , " he said . on monday , us trade representative rob portman said in a statement , however , that washington was unhappy because the eu had " only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them , " thereby not tackling us concerns head on and forcing washington 's hand . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " he said .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " washington had decided to take the case to the wto because that was the best way to prevent the aircraft dispute from spilling over into other tussles on steel duties and biotechnology , portman 's office said . on monday , after washington 's announcement , mandelson and portman had issued a joint statement . dispute will not affect other areas of cooperation " we remain united in our determination that this dispute shall not affect our cooperation on wider bilateral and multilateral trade issues , " they said .
" we have worked together well so far , and intend to continue to do so . " the dispute over aid to airbus and boeing was inflamed lately when airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal under wto rules , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us seeks arbitration over airbus subsidies the us will ask the world trade organization tuesday to create an arbitration panel to resolve a dispute over european subsidies to aircraft maker airbus , the us trade representative said in a statement .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

blair , whose country assumes the rotating eu presidency in july , has called for a " time for reflection " as europe mulls where to go next , and the british media said he would call off a referendum if the netherlands voted against the constitution . others worried articulating eu concerns , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany warned that the bloc faced a " massive problem " if the dutch rejected the constitution and britain decided against a referendum . " we know ... that after the french ' no ' the chance the dutch vote will be unsuccessful has greatly increased , " he said in a radio interview . if britain then backed away from a referendum , " this will become a massive problem .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

indeed , the french " no " vote sunday and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's defeat in a key state election the previous weekend threaten an all-out stall for europe 's already sputtering franco-german motor .
" what the result means is that the franco-german axis is in serious trouble .
it 's the end of a phase which began in 2002 , " said charles powell , senior researcher at the elcano royal institute think tank in madrid .

"
on tuesday , chirac also reacted to the vote by appointing dominique de villepin as his new prime minister in a major government reshuffle .
villepin , the 51-year-old former foreign minister who earned a worldwide reputation for his impassioned defense of france 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , replaces the deeply unpopular jean-pierre raffarin . raffarin was named prime minister in 2002 , upon president jacques chirac 's re-election to a second term .
villepin had served as the country 's interior minister until tuesday .
chirac , like many french citizens , is extremely proud of france 's role as a founding member of an integrated europe .
other eu states have rejected treaties - denmark said no to the maastricht treaty in 1992 , and ireland initially snubbed the nice treaty in 2001 - but france is another matter .
lack of sympathy " france is complicating the construction of europe .
so there is no reason for anyone to feel any particular sympathy for the country , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .
across the border and the political spectrum , schröder has been leading the other half of the eu 's driving force , but he has been severely weakened by an election reversal in germany 's most populous state this month .

they have lost the " ability to attract majorities " for their proposals .
waning political power according to alfred grosser , a french political science and history expert , chirac and schröder have been widely discredited by recent events .
" they will be severely weakened in the eyes of the other member states at the european union summit in mid-june , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac campaigned in favor of ratification , to no avail the german parliament finally ratified the treaty on friday , while the french people decided whether it should be adopted .

" we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " he said .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies .

" the eu and us first filed requests for consultations at the wto in october - the formal opening shot in the wto 's dispute procedures - but later agreed to freeze the process as they tried to reach a settlement . washington 's wto complaint was announced shortly after mandelson had made a fresh proposal to resolve the dispute by trimming state aid to both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : number two now eu promised subsidies reduction on tuesday , mandelson hinted that he believed the us had acted in bad faith . " i think it is as well for the world to know that we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution while the united states was planning to take this matter to the wto , " he said . on monday , us trade representative rob portman said in a statement , however , that washington was unhappy because the eu had " only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them , " thereby not tackling us concerns head on and forcing washington 's hand . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " he said .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " washington had decided to take the case to the wto because that was the best way to prevent the aircraft dispute from spilling over into other tussles on steel duties and biotechnology , portman 's office said . on monday , after washington 's announcement , mandelson and portman had issued a joint statement . dispute will not affect other areas of cooperation " we remain united in our determination that this dispute shall not affect our cooperation on wider bilateral and multilateral trade issues , " they said .
" we have worked together well so far , and intend to continue to do so . " the dispute over aid to airbus and boeing was inflamed lately when airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal under wto rules , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us seeks arbitration over airbus subsidies the us will ask the world trade organization tuesday to create an arbitration panel to resolve a dispute over european subsidies to aircraft maker airbus , the us trade representative said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away germany : european smoker 's paradise germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany -pipe- 31.05.2005 scaring smokers straight in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teenage girls have had the largest increase in smoking a project in a heidelberg hospital called " no butts " is taking the scared-straight approach to curbing teenage smoking .
on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

" the growing authority of neo-nazis and the ever firmer foothold they have in german public life worries us , " he said .
" there is the danger that the growth of neo-nazism could postpone the end of the post-war period and prevent us distancing ourselves from the war . "
" we must fight against any neo-nazi words at an early stage , before they can spread and take hold , " katsav stressed .
the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- rocked germany 's mainstream parties when it won a handful of seats in an eastern german state parliament last year .
the german government has tried unsuccessfully to ban the party .
" a strong and mature democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he began his state visit on monday , katsav had praised germany 's efforts to fight anti-semitism .
" germany is a strong and mature democracy and the resolve of german politicians to fight anti-semitism is impressive , " katsav said after a meeting with his german counterpart , horst köhler , who addressed the israeli parliament , the knesset , earlier this year .
" the relations between our two countries have been through some difficult times which we have overcome .
we both know that in the next 40 years these relations will not be entirely normal and as clear as with other countries , " katsav added .
on wednesday , katsav will visit the new memorial in central berlin dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
the israeli president said israel is concerned by signs of anti-semitism in germany , but recognized official determination to fight it .

a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .
but whether it is just doodling or art is a question an exhibition in nuremberg is hoping to shed light on . gone are the days when the rage of the young men of the ' 68 generation would lead them to smearing political slogans on fences and walls during the night .
these days , the subversives are n't as concerned with the day 's political issues , rather , they prefer running around making creations that lie in the grey area between art and property destruction . one finds them on sides of building , on overpasses and trains - and now , in nuremberg 's main library .
they 're shrill , glowing , colorful and alive . " graffitti is half art , that is undisputable , " said siegfried leykamm , who has assembled this collection .
" and many museums are interested in these graffiti artists .
it is not considered art only because anything done outside lawful means usually is n't , no ' ifs ' ' ands ' or ' buts ' . " at the beginning is a " corpora delicti , " a 40 square-meter wood display of spray paint cans and pictures in a " legal " graffiti action .
covered with abstract figures , the board shows the exhibits off effectively .
it functions as the anchor to the 150 photographs of graffiti works , most of which come from the franconia region in southern germany . bildunterschrift : hard to prevent meaningless labels or ornaments in one , a dog pees , deceptively real , almost like in a trompe l 'oeil .
on a another wall , a comic-like bear sporting a crown grins and a monster tries to make the viewer jump in terror .
sometimes , ornamental initials appearing on train cars or factory walls are elegant and curved ; other times other times they are just meaningless jumbles . the pictures in the exposition are not computer-generated photos but actual reproductions of real work .
when interior minister otto schilly recently came up with an idea to use helicopters and infrared cameras to catch graffiti artists , leykamm says it was a bit of overkill . there are other ways to control graffiti , he adds : one has to find a dialogue between the authorities and the graffiti enthusiasts because with a ban and arrests and prosecutions , one wo n't solve anything . graffitti for centuries graffiti is not a modern-day phenomenon .
vikings drew pictures and scribbled little messages about themselves or their loves on sacred ancient burial sites after invading north scotland .
in this exhibition , there are photos of centuries-old scribblings etched on a 1516 built grain house belonging to a religious order - directly behind the police station there today . tomas senne -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grappling with graffiti 's darker side when it comes to graffiti , one man 's art is another man 's vandalism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on eastern germany museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany east german loses copyright battle over beloved traffic symbol a win-win situation for american investors in east germany eastern germany gets pep talk on wasting money germany -pipe- 31.05.2005 how the stasi rigged east german sports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1990 , the stasi destroyed 90 percent of its archives with the notorious rosewood file now lifting the lid on more stasi subterfuge , experts on gdr sports argue that it 's time former collaborators with east germany 's secret service were called to account . the " rosewood file " is something of a holy grail in the world of international espionage .
under the aegis of the stasi archive - named the birthler behörde after its director , marianne birthler - a research group is now concluding work on what experts believe is the definitive source on east germany 's infamous secret police , handed back over to germany by the cia in 2003 . allegedly , it contains a few surprises .
in an interview with the magazine mut , project leader helmut müller-enbergs revealed that in the late 1980s , up to 18 secret agents with the stasi 's center for foreign espionage -lrb- hva -rrb- were active in the west german foreign ministry . west german universities were also infiltrated with informers more densely than previously believed , with 43 spies operating at berlin 's free university , and another 12 at the technical university .
as well as containing names of west germans working for the stasi , the report also lists some 20,000 to 30,000 east germans working unofficially as stasi informers in the four decades up to the fall of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " clearly , a file like this can clear up a lot of mysteries , " said christian booss , spokesperson with the birthler behörde . " when the rosewood file came to light , a lot of authorities decided that on the basis of its findings they 'd take a last opportunity before the statute of limitations runs out in 2006 to screen civil servants .
most of the applications have come from cdu-ruled states in eastern german states - saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringen .
since early 2004 , we 've had over 100,000 requests . " stasi and sport among those getting hot under the collar could be numerous figures from the world of sport . in the mid-1990s , the national olympic committee and the german sport association -lrb- dsb -rrb- set up a commission made up of sport representatives , administrators and former ddr civil rights activists .
its task was to investigate the extent of the stasi 's role in east german sport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a recent bundestag report presented by marianne birthler and dsb president manfred von richthofen confirmed , many feel that its mandate has been too limited - one key problem being that the commission can only investigate individuals in response to specific requests . academics , politicians and stasi victims have now joined forces to call for a more extensive probe , based on similar lines to the three-year investigation into communist infiltration of german public broadcaster ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giselher spitzer , a sports historian , is the initiator of the " berlin declaration , " a project set up in september 2004 by victims of stasi intrigue and doping which demands german sports organizations launch more stringent inquiries into east germany 's state-sanctioned manipulation of its sports industry . winfried hermann from the green party agrees that that the existing commission 's research has been inadequate . " white-washing the past is not fair to the victims of the problem , " he told die welt . still relevant and according to spitzer , the problem is still highly topical . " there is evidence to suggest that individuals who have been identified as stasi agents are returning to sports , " he said , pointing to examples of former collaborators who now hold senior positions in the north german soccer association -lrb- nofv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a highly controversial move , the interior ministry last year invited east germany 's former national team coach bernd stange -lrb- who went on to train the iraqi national team under saddam hussein -rrb- to a symposium in leipzig on the world cup 2006 .
according to the birthler behörde , stange -lrb- photo -rrb- was a stasi informer for 14 years . most recently , roland gehrke , trainer of the up-and-coming luckenwalde wrestling club , was revealed to have been an informer between 1977 and 1988 , allegedly passing on information about his colleagues ' extra-marital affairs , sexual orientation , drinking habits and political leanings . taking offendors to task spitzer maintains that by 1989 , the stasi had enlisted some 3,000 informers from within east germany 's sporting ranks .
how many of them are still working in the industry today is unknown , primarily because few authorities have ever initiated investigations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " according to german sports law , no one who worked for the stasi or treated athletes with steroids is allowed to hold a top position , " said spitzer , referring to the case of wolfgang nitschke , the trainer of the german wrestling team who was dismissed last november .
" the berlin declaration says that in cases of conflict , the state should withdraw funding from associations which fail to dismiss guilty parties . "
as it stands , associations prefer to turn a blind eye - for two reasons .
" on the one hand , there can never be complete certainty about just how dangerous agent activity was , " explained spitzer .
" and on the other hand , many of these trainers are key to sporting success and no one wants to see them dismissed . " " widespread lack of awareness means the issue continues to be treated as harmless , " he stressed .
" ultimately , that means that former stasi agents will be allowed to set the pace in german sports .

" there is evidence to suggest that individuals who have been identified as stasi agents are returning to sports , " he said , pointing to examples of former collaborators who now hold senior positions in the north german soccer association -lrb- nofv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a highly controversial move , the interior ministry last year invited east germany 's former national team coach bernd stange -lrb- who went on to train the iraqi national team under saddam hussein -rrb- to a symposium in leipzig on the world cup 2006 .
according to the birthler behörde , stange -lrb- photo -rrb- was a stasi informer for 14 years . most recently , roland gehrke , trainer of the up-and-coming luckenwalde wrestling club , was revealed to have been an informer between 1977 and 1988 , allegedly passing on information about his colleagues ' extra-marital affairs , sexual orientation , drinking habits and political leanings . taking offendors to task spitzer maintains that by 1989 , the stasi had enlisted some 3,000 informers from within east germany 's sporting ranks .
how many of them are still working in the industry today is unknown , primarily because few authorities have ever initiated investigations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " according to german sports law , no one who worked for the stasi or treated athletes with steroids is allowed to hold a top position , " said spitzer , referring to the case of wolfgang nitschke , the trainer of the german wrestling team who was dismissed last november .
" the berlin declaration says that in cases of conflict , the state should withdraw funding from associations which fail to dismiss guilty parties . "
as it stands , associations prefer to turn a blind eye - for two reasons .
" on the one hand , there can never be complete certainty about just how dangerous agent activity was , " explained spitzer .
" and on the other hand , many of these trainers are key to sporting success and no one wants to see them dismissed . " " widespread lack of awareness means the issue continues to be treated as harmless , " he stressed .
" ultimately , that means that former stasi agents will be allowed to set the pace in german sports .

" eu leaders have a chance to regroup at a june 16-17 summit in brussels but quite what they will be able to agree on then is unclear , with nine of the 25 countries having already ratified the treaty . french influence the constitution - designed to streamline and harmonize how the expanding bloc is run - must be ratified by every country to take effect . opinion polls suggest a 60 percent " no " vote in the netherlands , with many swayed by the same gripes as the french - opposition to eu enlargement , fear of identity loss and unhappiness with the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of netherlands jan peter balkenende dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende urged voters to make up their own mind in the first national referendum in the netherlands in two centuries .
" france can not tell us what to do , " balkenende said .
" the dutch should n't merely take the lead from the french , they must make their own choice . " a dutch " no " could trigger a domino effect with at least six other nations also due to hold referendums later , including euroskeptic britain , poland and denmark . british prime minister tony blair appears to be steering away from holding his planned vote next year on the back of the french defeat and likely dutch setback .
blair , whose country assumes the rotating eu presidency in july , has called for a " time for reflection " as europe mulls where to go next , and the british media said he would call off a referendum if the netherlands voted against the constitution . others worried articulating eu concerns , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany warned that the bloc faced a " massive problem " if the dutch rejected the constitution and britain decided against a referendum . " we know ... that after the french ' no ' the chance the dutch vote will be unsuccessful has greatly increased , " he said in a radio interview . if britain then backed away from a referendum , " this will become a massive problem . " in warsaw , president aleksander kwasniewski called for consultations in the next few days to allow it to take a " sovereign decision on the way and date of ratification . " one theoretical option would be to renegotiate the treaty and make it more palatable , but that has been rejected by leaders such as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country votes on september 27 .
he said it would be " senseless " to ask danes to vote on a treaty that could be rewritten .

" what the result means is that the franco-german axis is in serious trouble .
it 's the end of a phase which began in 2002 , " said charles powell , senior researcher at the elcano royal institute think tank in madrid .

"
on tuesday , chirac also reacted to the vote by appointing dominique de villepin as his new prime minister in a major government reshuffle .
villepin , the 51-year-old former foreign minister who earned a worldwide reputation for his impassioned defense of france 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , replaces the deeply unpopular jean-pierre raffarin . raffarin was named prime minister in 2002 , upon president jacques chirac 's re-election to a second term .
villepin had served as the country 's interior minister until tuesday .
chirac , like many french citizens , is extremely proud of france 's role as a founding member of an integrated europe .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .
but whether it is just doodling or art is a question an exhibition in nuremberg is hoping to shed light on . gone are the days when the rage of the young men of the ' 68 generation would lead them to smearing political slogans on fences and walls during the night .
these days , the subversives are n't as concerned with the day 's political issues , rather , they prefer running around making creations that lie in the grey area between art and property destruction . one finds them on sides of building , on overpasses and trains - and now , in nuremberg 's main library .
they 're shrill , glowing , colorful and alive . " graffitti is half art , that is undisputable , " said siegfried leykamm , who has assembled this collection .
" and many museums are interested in these graffiti artists .
it is not considered art only because anything done outside lawful means usually is n't , no ' ifs ' ' ands ' or ' buts ' . " at the beginning is a " corpora delicti , " a 40 square-meter wood display of spray paint cans and pictures in a " legal " graffiti action .
covered with abstract figures , the board shows the exhibits off effectively .
it functions as the anchor to the 150 photographs of graffiti works , most of which come from the franconia region in southern germany . bildunterschrift : hard to prevent meaningless labels or ornaments in one , a dog pees , deceptively real , almost like in a trompe l 'oeil .
on a another wall , a comic-like bear sporting a crown grins and a monster tries to make the viewer jump in terror .
sometimes , ornamental initials appearing on train cars or factory walls are elegant and curved ; other times other times they are just meaningless jumbles . the pictures in the exposition are not computer-generated photos but actual reproductions of real work .
when interior minister otto schilly recently came up with an idea to use helicopters and infrared cameras to catch graffiti artists , leykamm says it was a bit of overkill . there are other ways to control graffiti , he adds : one has to find a dialogue between the authorities and the graffiti enthusiasts because with a ban and arrests and prosecutions , one wo n't solve anything . graffitti for centuries graffiti is not a modern-day phenomenon .
vikings drew pictures and scribbled little messages about themselves or their loves on sacred ancient burial sites after invading north scotland .
in this exhibition , there are photos of centuries-old scribblings etched on a 1516 built grain house belonging to a religious order - directly behind the police station there today . tomas senne -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grappling with graffiti 's darker side when it comes to graffiti , one man 's art is another man 's vandalism .
on thursday , berlin hosted the first international anti-graffiti conference where participants looked at ways to put a lid on the spray cans . -lrb- april 8 , 2005 -rrb- virtual graffiti - a sign of the future ?
possibly inspired by those yellow " post-it " notes ubiquitous in workplaces , researchers for german cell phone manufacturer siemens have developed technology that lets users leave virtual graffiti in their wake .

under the aegis of the stasi archive - named the birthler behörde after its director , marianne birthler - a research group is now concluding work on what experts believe is the definitive source on east germany 's infamous secret police , handed back over to germany by the cia in 2003 . allegedly , it contains a few surprises .
in an interview with the magazine mut , project leader helmut müller-enbergs revealed that in the late 1980s , up to 18 secret agents with the stasi 's center for foreign espionage -lrb- hva -rrb- were active in the west german foreign ministry . west german universities were also infiltrated with informers more densely than previously believed , with 43 spies operating at berlin 's free university , and another 12 at the technical university .
as well as containing names of west germans working for the stasi , the report also lists some 20,000 to 30,000 east germans working unofficially as stasi informers in the four decades up to the fall of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " clearly , a file like this can clear up a lot of mysteries , " said christian booss , spokesperson with the birthler behörde . " when the rosewood file came to light , a lot of authorities decided that on the basis of its findings they 'd take a last opportunity before the statute of limitations runs out in 2006 to screen civil servants .

" white-washing the past is not fair to the victims of the problem , " he told die welt . still relevant and according to spitzer , the problem is still highly topical .

according to the birthler behörde , stange -lrb- photo -rrb- was a stasi informer for 14 years . most recently , roland gehrke , trainer of the up-and-coming luckenwalde wrestling club , was revealed to have been an informer between 1977 and 1988 , allegedly passing on information about his colleagues ' extra-marital affairs , sexual orientation , drinking habits and political leanings . taking offendors to task spitzer maintains that by 1989 , the stasi had enlisted some 3,000 informers from within east germany 's sporting ranks .
how many of them are still working in the industry today is unknown , primarily because few authorities have ever initiated investigations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " according to german sports law , no one who worked for the stasi or treated athletes with steroids is allowed to hold a top position , " said spitzer , referring to the case of wolfgang nitschke , the trainer of the german wrestling team who was dismissed last november .

as it stands , associations prefer to turn a blind eye - for two reasons .
" on the one hand , there can never be complete certainty about just how dangerous agent activity was , " explained spitzer .
" and on the other hand , many of these trainers are key to sporting success and no one wants to see them dismissed . " " widespread lack of awareness means the issue continues to be treated as harmless , " he stressed .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

dutch voters are eligible to cast ballots in a june 1 referendum on the constitution , three days after the french go to the polls in their referendum .
the latest opinion polls indicate that more than 60 percent will oppose the eu constitution in the netherlands .
-lrb- ap photo / peter dejong -rrb- nevertheless , the eu commission in brussels reiterated that it is not making any contingency plans .
" there is still no plan b , " said spokeswoman francoise le bail .
" we have to wait for the next step tomorrow evening . " eu leaders have a chance to regroup at a june 16-17 summit in brussels but quite what they will be able to agree on then is unclear , with nine of the 25 countries having already ratified the treaty . french influence the constitution - designed to streamline and harmonize how the expanding bloc is run - must be ratified by every country to take effect . opinion polls suggest a 60 percent " no " vote in the netherlands , with many swayed by the same gripes as the french - opposition to eu enlargement , fear of identity loss and unhappiness with the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of netherlands jan peter balkenende dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende urged voters to make up their own mind in the first national referendum in the netherlands in two centuries .
" france can not tell us what to do , " balkenende said .
" the dutch should n't merely take the lead from the french , they must make their own choice . " a dutch " no " could trigger a domino effect with at least six other nations also due to hold referendums later , including euroskeptic britain , poland and denmark . british prime minister tony blair appears to be steering away from holding his planned vote next year on the back of the french defeat and likely dutch setback .
blair , whose country assumes the rotating eu presidency in july , has called for a " time for reflection " as europe mulls where to go next , and the british media said he would call off a referendum if the netherlands voted against the constitution . others worried articulating eu concerns , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany warned that the bloc faced a " massive problem " if the dutch rejected the constitution and britain decided against a referendum . " we know ... that after the french ' no ' the chance the dutch vote will be unsuccessful has greatly increased , " he said in a radio interview . if britain then backed away from a referendum , " this will become a massive problem . " in warsaw , president aleksander kwasniewski called for consultations in the next few days to allow it to take a " sovereign decision on the way and date of ratification . " one theoretical option would be to renegotiate the treaty and make it more palatable , but that has been rejected by leaders such as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country votes on september 27 .
he said it would be " senseless " to ask danes to vote on a treaty that could be rewritten .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

must be loyal , affectionate , understanding - and a blue-blooded saxon ... hmmm , that narrows the options somewhat . it happens all the time .
scarred by a recent divorce , an older man decides life 's too short to spend it alone , and does what morose singles across the country often do - he takes out a lonely hearts ad in the tabloid bild . but in this case , the man in question has a few bonus points up his perfectly tailored sleeve .
he happens to be the 51-year-old prince rüdiger of saxony , the great-grandchild of the last king of saxony friedrich august iii and a regular fixture in the gossip columns after an acrimonious split from his wife diana . " genuine prince , sweet natured and industrious , " the ad reads , " seeks , after much disappointment , a decent woman aged between 25 and 50 for marriage .
pocket money of 2,500 euros a month , as well as a wardrobe and jewellery for receptions , balls and trips . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold-diggers take note : " my future wife will be marrying into one of the oldest dynasties in europe .
one that ruled the kingdom of saxony for 829 years .
and i will lay all my love and treasures at her feet , including my 1,200 hectares of forest in moritzburg . "
a modern princess it sounds tempting , but there is a catch - as his ex can confirm .
the prince wants a girl who 'll muck around on the royal estates , a task diana flatly refused .
like all princesses worth their salt , she preferred shopping .
another potential hitch ?
rüdiger would prefer a local lass .
oh - and commoners need not apply .
" i am looking for a princess to marry , ideally one from saxony , " he explained .
but if a suitable german can not be found from within its aristocratic ranks , he said he 'd be willing to seek candidates among britain 's royal set .
" the woman of my dreams must be gentle , loving and a loyal companion , " he added .
" she will be understanding of my forestry work , my social projects and my cultural ambitions . "
spoiled for choice it 's a tall order , but bild is already fielding responses from willing applicants , even if not all of them quite meet the criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's princess madeleine probably is n't interested ...

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

under the aegis of the stasi archive - named the birthler behörde after its director , marianne birthler - a research group is now concluding work on what experts believe is the definitive source on east germany 's infamous secret police , handed back over to germany by the cia in 2003 . allegedly , it contains a few surprises .
in an interview with the magazine mut , project leader helmut müller-enbergs revealed that in the late 1980s , up to 18 secret agents with the stasi 's center for foreign espionage -lrb- hva -rrb- were active in the west german foreign ministry . west german universities were also infiltrated with informers more densely than previously believed , with 43 spies operating at berlin 's free university , and another 12 at the technical university .
as well as containing names of west germans working for the stasi , the report also lists some 20,000 to 30,000 east germans working unofficially as stasi informers in the four decades up to the fall of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " clearly , a file like this can clear up a lot of mysteries , " said christian booss , spokesperson with the birthler behörde .

according to the birthler behörde , stange -lrb- photo -rrb- was a stasi informer for 14 years . most recently , roland gehrke , trainer of the up-and-coming luckenwalde wrestling club , was revealed to have been an informer between 1977 and 1988 , allegedly passing on information about his colleagues ' extra-marital affairs , sexual orientation , drinking habits and political leanings . taking offendors to task spitzer maintains that by 1989 , the stasi had enlisted some 3,000 informers from within east germany 's sporting ranks .

" the growing authority of neo-nazis and the ever firmer foothold they have in german public life worries us , " he said .
" there is the danger that the growth of neo-nazism could postpone the end of the post-war period and prevent us distancing ourselves from the war . "
" we must fight against any neo-nazi words at an early stage , before they can spread and take hold , " katsav stressed .
the extreme-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- rocked germany 's mainstream parties when it won a handful of seats in an eastern german state parliament last year .
the german government has tried unsuccessfully to ban the party .
" a strong and mature democracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he began his state visit on monday , katsav had praised germany 's efforts to fight anti-semitism .
" germany is a strong and mature democracy and the resolve of german politicians to fight anti-semitism is impressive , " katsav said after a meeting with his german counterpart , horst köhler , who addressed the israeli parliament , the knesset , earlier this year .

do newspapers have a future ?
the question has been asked since the advent of the internet - most recently , by attendees at the world newspaper conference in seoul . everything was better in the old days , or so they say .
but for the german newspaper business , the bromide is financially proveable .
in the 1990s , mailboxes across the country were filled to bursting with fat weekend editions of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , whose editorial content was pumped up with hefty classified sections .
but over time , an ongoing economic crisis and stubborn joblessness have led germany 's most respected newspaper - and its budget - to shrink noticeably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne tabloid " direkt " the slump in classifieds has also affected many other newspapers .
but " there are not only economic reasons for the dramatic reduction in ad revenue , " explained robin meyer-lucht of the institute for media and communication management at the university of st. gallen , switzerland .
in 2003 , meyer-lucht , together with peter glotz , published a comprehensive study on the future of the press and online journalism .
in large part , he said , the lucrative sale of space for job , real estate and classified ads has gone to the internet .
and the study , which based its results on a poll of some 200 experts , said newspapers should expect further revenue declines in this area .
readership is down newspapers are n't just losing classified ads - they 're losing readers , said michael haller , a journalism professor at the university of leipzig .
" the total circulation of daily press is sinking consistently by between one and two percent each year , " the professor wrote .
above all , the target group prized by advertisers , 20 to 40 year olds , are reading fewer newspapers .
ten years ago , some 70 percent of 20 to 40 year olds read the paper - today it is just 60 percent .
in comparison , the most loyal and assiduous group of readers are retirees .
publisher alfred neven dumont agrees : " our best readership are the elderly , the pensioners , " he said in february in reference to the welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot , paranews , a " collaborative weblog " of news newspapers are looking for different ways to emerge from this crisis .
at first , publishers reacted to the changing economic scene by reducing their content , but they did n't hesitate to resort to layoffs .
the süddeutsche zeitung discontinued its innovative youth magazine jetzt and the faz dropped successful young editor and novelist florian illies .
the frankfurter rundschau , drowning in a sea of red ink , had to reduce its staff by more than half - from 1,700 down to 750 .
book publishing , tabloids new business areas are expected to help compensate for revenue losses .
the süddeutsche zeitung imported an idea that showed promise in italy , and brought its own sz-library literature series to the market - with success .
just six weeks into the effort , the paper sold more than five million low-cost books .
they have also begun publishing dvd editions , books on tape , and additional book series .
others are hoping for salvation in the tabloid business .
cheap newspapers like welt kompakt , news or 20cent in the handy small format can be read easily in the subway and are extremely pared down in terms of editorial content - good for people who want a quick read on the way to the office .
longer background stories or analysis have no place in the cheaply produced papers , which mostly repackage news agency reports .
in great britain , the changeover to tabloid formats has even led to an increased print run for the independent newspaper .
but in contrast to the german papers , the independent chose not to cut back on editorial content when it changed formats .
the future is online ?
online journalism both benefits from and competes with the print media , according to the aforementioned study by glotz and meyer-lucht .
" in the foreseeable future , the internet will provide the daily medium for journalistic content for a large portion of the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subway commuters in stockholm , sweden , reading the newspaper by 2010 , 63 percent of the german population will have access to online journalism .
experts agree that the increased use of the internet for getting daily information will come at the expense of newspapers .
" online journalism makes it possible to publish in quick , timely fashion , and to continually update the stories , " said meyer-lucht .
for readers , online has the advantage that you can quickly call up several publications , to compare them while reading .
" given the diversity in the media , the daily paper is simply no longer the first address for getting information , " said meyer-lucht .
the propagation of the media has led to readers being able to shop around and find the best way to meet their individual information needs .
four-hour job many consider the reduced texts and simpler layouts of online journalism to be assets .
meyer-lucht is convinced that some readers feel ovewhelmed by the amount of information in daily newspapers , and feel guilty about not reading the whole newspapers .
" i 've done the math , " meyer-lucht said .
" to read a daily paper from front to back can often take more than four hours . "
but the problem then becomes how to finance online content .
the internet is still shrouded in a no-cost mentality .
few are willing to pay for web content , especially information .
" to date , no one has been able to establish a workable pay service in terms of internet news content , " meyer-lucht said .
the main source of income has remained advertising .
according to a study of the online publishers association , european web sites get 70 percent of their financing by advertising - with that amount growing , said meyer-lucht .
but its possible this could change in the future .
" as online use increases and becomes more differentiated , the chances for paid content are greater , " he said . torsten gellner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german papers face free sheet assault swedish company metro appears to be quietly preparing a bid to launch the first free daily paper in germany .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .

the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .

recent political events in france and germany underscore the weakness of the alliance provides the motor of europe 's economy .
is the eu polticially hamstrung ? france 's rejection of the eu constitution strikes a further damaging blow to its already waning influence in the bloc , only a week after long-time eu partner germany was thrown into turmoil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite schröder 's campaigning in toulouse for french ratification of the eu constitution , the ' no 's had it .
indeed , the french " no " vote sunday and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's defeat in a key state election the previous weekend threaten an all-out stall for europe 's already sputtering franco-german motor .
" what the result means is that the franco-german axis is in serious trouble .
it 's the end of a phase which began in 2002 , " said charles powell , senior researcher at the elcano royal institute think tank in madrid .
cabinet reshuffle : de villepin as premier less than half an hour after the rejection of the treaty , aimed at improving decision making in the 25-member bloc , was announced , even an embarrassed french president jacques chirac acknowledged there would be trouble ahead .

do newspapers have a future ?
the question has been asked since the advent of the internet - most recently , by attendees at the world newspaper conference in seoul . everything was better in the old days , or so they say .
but for the german newspaper business , the bromide is financially proveable .
in the 1990s , mailboxes across the country were filled to bursting with fat weekend editions of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , whose editorial content was pumped up with hefty classified sections .
but over time , an ongoing economic crisis and stubborn joblessness have led germany 's most respected newspaper - and its budget - to shrink noticeably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne tabloid " direkt " the slump in classifieds has also affected many other newspapers .
but " there are not only economic reasons for the dramatic reduction in ad revenue , " explained robin meyer-lucht of the institute for media and communication management at the university of st. gallen , switzerland .
in 2003 , meyer-lucht , together with peter glotz , published a comprehensive study on the future of the press and online journalism .
in large part , he said , the lucrative sale of space for job , real estate and classified ads has gone to the internet .
and the study , which based its results on a poll of some 200 experts , said newspapers should expect further revenue declines in this area .
readership is down newspapers are n't just losing classified ads - they 're losing readers , said michael haller , a journalism professor at the university of leipzig .
" the total circulation of daily press is sinking consistently by between one and two percent each year , " the professor wrote .
above all , the target group prized by advertisers , 20 to 40 year olds , are reading fewer newspapers .
ten years ago , some 70 percent of 20 to 40 year olds read the paper - today it is just 60 percent .
in comparison , the most loyal and assiduous group of readers are retirees .
publisher alfred neven dumont agrees : " our best readership are the elderly , the pensioners , " he said in february in reference to the welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot , paranews , a " collaborative weblog " of news newspapers are looking for different ways to emerge from this crisis .
at first , publishers reacted to the changing economic scene by reducing their content , but they did n't hesitate to resort to layoffs .
the süddeutsche zeitung discontinued its innovative youth magazine jetzt and the faz dropped successful young editor and novelist florian illies .
the frankfurter rundschau , drowning in a sea of red ink , had to reduce its staff by more than half - from 1,700 down to 750 .
book publishing , tabloids new business areas are expected to help compensate for revenue losses .
the süddeutsche zeitung imported an idea that showed promise in italy , and brought its own sz-library literature series to the market - with success .
just six weeks into the effort , the paper sold more than five million low-cost books .
they have also begun publishing dvd editions , books on tape , and additional book series .
others are hoping for salvation in the tabloid business .
cheap newspapers like welt kompakt , news or 20cent in the handy small format can be read easily in the subway and are extremely pared down in terms of editorial content - good for people who want a quick read on the way to the office .
longer background stories or analysis have no place in the cheaply produced papers , which mostly repackage news agency reports .
in great britain , the changeover to tabloid formats has even led to an increased print run for the independent newspaper .
but in contrast to the german papers , the independent chose not to cut back on editorial content when it changed formats .
the future is online ?

do newspapers have a future ?
the question has been asked since the advent of the internet - most recently , by attendees at the world newspaper conference in seoul . everything was better in the old days , or so they say .
but for the german newspaper business , the bromide is financially proveable .
in the 1990s , mailboxes across the country were filled to bursting with fat weekend editions of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , whose editorial content was pumped up with hefty classified sections .
but over time , an ongoing economic crisis and stubborn joblessness have led germany 's most respected newspaper - and its budget - to shrink noticeably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne tabloid " direkt " the slump in classifieds has also affected many other newspapers .
but " there are not only economic reasons for the dramatic reduction in ad revenue , " explained robin meyer-lucht of the institute for media and communication management at the university of st. gallen , switzerland .
in 2003 , meyer-lucht , together with peter glotz , published a comprehensive study on the future of the press and online journalism .
in large part , he said , the lucrative sale of space for job , real estate and classified ads has gone to the internet .
and the study , which based its results on a poll of some 200 experts , said newspapers should expect further revenue declines in this area .
readership is down newspapers are n't just losing classified ads - they 're losing readers , said michael haller , a journalism professor at the university of leipzig .
" the total circulation of daily press is sinking consistently by between one and two percent each year , " the professor wrote .
above all , the target group prized by advertisers , 20 to 40 year olds , are reading fewer newspapers .
ten years ago , some 70 percent of 20 to 40 year olds read the paper - today it is just 60 percent .
in comparison , the most loyal and assiduous group of readers are retirees .
publisher alfred neven dumont agrees : " our best readership are the elderly , the pensioners , " he said in february in reference to the welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot , paranews , a " collaborative weblog " of news newspapers are looking for different ways to emerge from this crisis .
at first , publishers reacted to the changing economic scene by reducing their content , but they did n't hesitate to resort to layoffs .
the süddeutsche zeitung discontinued its innovative youth magazine jetzt and the faz dropped successful young editor and novelist florian illies .
the frankfurter rundschau , drowning in a sea of red ink , had to reduce its staff by more than half - from 1,700 down to 750 .
book publishing , tabloids new business areas are expected to help compensate for revenue losses .
the süddeutsche zeitung imported an idea that showed promise in italy , and brought its own sz-library literature series to the market - with success .
just six weeks into the effort , the paper sold more than five million low-cost books .
they have also begun publishing dvd editions , books on tape , and additional book series .
others are hoping for salvation in the tabloid business .
cheap newspapers like welt kompakt , news or 20cent in the handy small format can be read easily in the subway and are extremely pared down in terms of editorial content - good for people who want a quick read on the way to the office .
longer background stories or analysis have no place in the cheaply produced papers , which mostly repackage news agency reports .
in great britain , the changeover to tabloid formats has even led to an increased print run for the independent newspaper .
but in contrast to the german papers , the independent chose not to cut back on editorial content when it changed formats .
the future is online ?
online journalism both benefits from and competes with the print media , according to the aforementioned study by glotz and meyer-lucht .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .
but whether it is just doodling or art is a question an exhibition in nuremberg is hoping to shed light on . gone are the days when the rage of the young men of the ' 68 generation would lead them to smearing political slogans on fences and walls during the night .
these days , the subversives are n't as concerned with the day 's political issues , rather , they prefer running around making creations that lie in the grey area between art and property destruction . one finds them on sides of building , on overpasses and trains - and now , in nuremberg 's main library .
they 're shrill , glowing , colorful and alive . " graffitti is half art , that is undisputable , " said siegfried leykamm , who has assembled this collection .
" and many museums are interested in these graffiti artists .
it is not considered art only because anything done outside lawful means usually is n't , no ' ifs ' ' ands ' or ' buts ' . " at the beginning is a " corpora delicti , " a 40 square-meter wood display of spray paint cans and pictures in a " legal " graffiti action .
covered with abstract figures , the board shows the exhibits off effectively .
it functions as the anchor to the 150 photographs of graffiti works , most of which come from the franconia region in southern germany . bildunterschrift : hard to prevent meaningless labels or ornaments in one , a dog pees , deceptively real , almost like in a trompe l 'oeil .
on a another wall , a comic-like bear sporting a crown grins and a monster tries to make the viewer jump in terror .
sometimes , ornamental initials appearing on train cars or factory walls are elegant and curved ; other times other times they are just meaningless jumbles . the pictures in the exposition are not computer-generated photos but actual reproductions of real work .
when interior minister otto schilly recently came up with an idea to use helicopters and infrared cameras to catch graffiti artists , leykamm says it was a bit of overkill . there are other ways to control graffiti , he adds : one has to find a dialogue between the authorities and the graffiti enthusiasts because with a ban and arrests and prosecutions , one wo n't solve anything . graffitti for centuries graffiti is not a modern-day phenomenon .
vikings drew pictures and scribbled little messages about themselves or their loves on sacred ancient burial sites after invading north scotland .
in this exhibition , there are photos of centuries-old scribblings etched on a 1516 built grain house belonging to a religious order - directly behind the police station there today . tomas senne -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grappling with graffiti 's darker side when it comes to graffiti , one man 's art is another man 's vandalism .

do newspapers have a future ?
the question has been asked since the advent of the internet - most recently , by attendees at the world newspaper conference in seoul . everything was better in the old days , or so they say .
but for the german newspaper business , the bromide is financially proveable .
in the 1990s , mailboxes across the country were filled to bursting with fat weekend editions of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , whose editorial content was pumped up with hefty classified sections .
but over time , an ongoing economic crisis and stubborn joblessness have led germany 's most respected newspaper - and its budget - to shrink noticeably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne tabloid " direkt " the slump in classifieds has also affected many other newspapers .
but " there are not only economic reasons for the dramatic reduction in ad revenue , " explained robin meyer-lucht of the institute for media and communication management at the university of st. gallen , switzerland .
in 2003 , meyer-lucht , together with peter glotz , published a comprehensive study on the future of the press and online journalism .
in large part , he said , the lucrative sale of space for job , real estate and classified ads has gone to the internet .
and the study , which based its results on a poll of some 200 experts , said newspapers should expect further revenue declines in this area .
readership is down newspapers are n't just losing classified ads - they 're losing readers , said michael haller , a journalism professor at the university of leipzig .
" the total circulation of daily press is sinking consistently by between one and two percent each year , " the professor wrote .
above all , the target group prized by advertisers , 20 to 40 year olds , are reading fewer newspapers .
ten years ago , some 70 percent of 20 to 40 year olds read the paper - today it is just 60 percent .
in comparison , the most loyal and assiduous group of readers are retirees .
publisher alfred neven dumont agrees : " our best readership are the elderly , the pensioners , " he said in february in reference to the welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot , paranews , a " collaborative weblog " of news newspapers are looking for different ways to emerge from this crisis .
at first , publishers reacted to the changing economic scene by reducing their content , but they did n't hesitate to resort to layoffs .
the süddeutsche zeitung discontinued its innovative youth magazine jetzt and the faz dropped successful young editor and novelist florian illies .
the frankfurter rundschau , drowning in a sea of red ink , had to reduce its staff by more than half - from 1,700 down to 750 .
book publishing , tabloids new business areas are expected to help compensate for revenue losses .
the süddeutsche zeitung imported an idea that showed promise in italy , and brought its own sz-library literature series to the market - with success .
just six weeks into the effort , the paper sold more than five million low-cost books .
they have also begun publishing dvd editions , books on tape , and additional book series .
others are hoping for salvation in the tabloid business .
cheap newspapers like welt kompakt , news or 20cent in the handy small format can be read easily in the subway and are extremely pared down in terms of editorial content - good for people who want a quick read on the way to the office .
longer background stories or analysis have no place in the cheaply produced papers , which mostly repackage news agency reports .
in great britain , the changeover to tabloid formats has even led to an increased print run for the independent newspaper .
but in contrast to the german papers , the independent chose not to cut back on editorial content when it changed formats .
the future is online ?
online journalism both benefits from and competes with the print media , according to the aforementioned study by glotz and meyer-lucht .
" in the foreseeable future , the internet will provide the daily medium for journalistic content for a large portion of the public , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subway commuters in stockholm , sweden , reading the newspaper by 2010 , 63 percent of the german population will have access to online journalism .
experts agree that the increased use of the internet for getting daily information will come at the expense of newspapers .
" online journalism makes it possible to publish in quick , timely fashion , and to continually update the stories , " said meyer-lucht .
for readers , online has the advantage that you can quickly call up several publications , to compare them while reading .
" given the diversity in the media , the daily paper is simply no longer the first address for getting information , " said meyer-lucht .
the propagation of the media has led to readers being able to shop around and find the best way to meet their individual information needs .
four-hour job many consider the reduced texts and simpler layouts of online journalism to be assets .
meyer-lucht is convinced that some readers feel ovewhelmed by the amount of information in daily newspapers , and feel guilty about not reading the whole newspapers .
" i 've done the math , " meyer-lucht said .
" to read a daily paper from front to back can often take more than four hours . "
but the problem then becomes how to finance online content .
the internet is still shrouded in a no-cost mentality .
few are willing to pay for web content , especially information .
" to date , no one has been able to establish a workable pay service in terms of internet news content , " meyer-lucht said .
the main source of income has remained advertising .
according to a study of the online publishers association , european web sites get 70 percent of their financing by advertising - with that amount growing , said meyer-lucht .
but its possible this could change in the future .
" as online use increases and becomes more differentiated , the chances for paid content are greater , " he said . torsten gellner -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german papers face free sheet assault swedish company metro appears to be quietly preparing a bid to launch the first free daily paper in germany .

do newspapers have a future ?
the question has been asked since the advent of the internet - most recently , by attendees at the world newspaper conference in seoul . everything was better in the old days , or so they say .
but for the german newspaper business , the bromide is financially proveable .
in the 1990s , mailboxes across the country were filled to bursting with fat weekend editions of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- , whose editorial content was pumped up with hefty classified sections .
but over time , an ongoing economic crisis and stubborn joblessness have led germany 's most respected newspaper - and its budget - to shrink noticeably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne tabloid " direkt " the slump in classifieds has also affected many other newspapers .
but " there are not only economic reasons for the dramatic reduction in ad revenue , " explained robin meyer-lucht of the institute for media and communication management at the university of st. gallen , switzerland .
in 2003 , meyer-lucht , together with peter glotz , published a comprehensive study on the future of the press and online journalism .
in large part , he said , the lucrative sale of space for job , real estate and classified ads has gone to the internet .
and the study , which based its results on a poll of some 200 experts , said newspapers should expect further revenue declines in this area .
readership is down newspapers are n't just losing classified ads - they 're losing readers , said michael haller , a journalism professor at the university of leipzig .
" the total circulation of daily press is sinking consistently by between one and two percent each year , " the professor wrote .
above all , the target group prized by advertisers , 20 to 40 year olds , are reading fewer newspapers .
ten years ago , some 70 percent of 20 to 40 year olds read the paper - today it is just 60 percent .
in comparison , the most loyal and assiduous group of readers are retirees .
publisher alfred neven dumont agrees : " our best readership are the elderly , the pensioners , " he said in february in reference to the welt am sonntag newspaper .

a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .

a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .
but whether it is just doodling or art is a question an exhibition in nuremberg is hoping to shed light on . gone are the days when the rage of the young men of the ' 68 generation would lead them to smearing political slogans on fences and walls during the night .
these days , the subversives are n't as concerned with the day 's political issues , rather , they prefer running around making creations that lie in the grey area between art and property destruction . one finds them on sides of building , on overpasses and trains - and now , in nuremberg 's main library .
they 're shrill , glowing , colorful and alive . " graffitti is half art , that is undisputable , " said siegfried leykamm , who has assembled this collection .
" and many museums are interested in these graffiti artists .
it is not considered art only because anything done outside lawful means usually is n't , no ' ifs ' ' ands ' or ' buts ' . " at the beginning is a " corpora delicti , " a 40 square-meter wood display of spray paint cans and pictures in a " legal " graffiti action .
covered with abstract figures , the board shows the exhibits off effectively .
it functions as the anchor to the 150 photographs of graffiti works , most of which come from the franconia region in southern germany . bildunterschrift : hard to prevent meaningless labels or ornaments in one , a dog pees , deceptively real , almost like in a trompe l 'oeil .
on a another wall , a comic-like bear sporting a crown grins and a monster tries to make the viewer jump in terror .
sometimes , ornamental initials appearing on train cars or factory walls are elegant and curved ; other times other times they are just meaningless jumbles . the pictures in the exposition are not computer-generated photos but actual reproductions of real work .
when interior minister otto schilly recently came up with an idea to use helicopters and infrared cameras to catch graffiti artists , leykamm says it was a bit of overkill . there are other ways to control graffiti , he adds : one has to find a dialogue between the authorities and the graffiti enthusiasts because with a ban and arrests and prosecutions , one wo n't solve anything . graffitti for centuries graffiti is not a modern-day phenomenon .
vikings drew pictures and scribbled little messages about themselves or their loves on sacred ancient burial sites after invading north scotland .
in this exhibition , there are photos of centuries-old scribblings etched on a 1516 built grain house belonging to a religious order - directly behind the police station there today . tomas senne -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grappling with graffiti 's darker side when it comes to graffiti , one man 's art is another man 's vandalism .

must be loyal , affectionate , understanding - and a blue-blooded saxon ... hmmm , that narrows the options somewhat . it happens all the time .
scarred by a recent divorce , an older man decides life 's too short to spend it alone , and does what morose singles across the country often do - he takes out a lonely hearts ad in the tabloid bild . but in this case , the man in question has a few bonus points up his perfectly tailored sleeve .
he happens to be the 51-year-old prince rüdiger of saxony , the great-grandchild of the last king of saxony friedrich august iii and a regular fixture in the gossip columns after an acrimonious split from his wife diana . " genuine prince , sweet natured and industrious , " the ad reads , " seeks , after much disappointment , a decent woman aged between 25 and 50 for marriage .
pocket money of 2,500 euros a month , as well as a wardrobe and jewellery for receptions , balls and trips . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold-diggers take note : " my future wife will be marrying into one of the oldest dynasties in europe .
one that ruled the kingdom of saxony for 829 years .
and i will lay all my love and treasures at her feet , including my 1,200 hectares of forest in moritzburg . "
a modern princess it sounds tempting , but there is a catch - as his ex can confirm .
the prince wants a girl who 'll muck around on the royal estates , a task diana flatly refused .
like all princesses worth their salt , she preferred shopping .
another potential hitch ?
rüdiger would prefer a local lass .
oh - and commoners need not apply .
" i am looking for a princess to marry , ideally one from saxony , " he explained .
but if a suitable german can not be found from within its aristocratic ranks , he said he 'd be willing to seek candidates among britain 's royal set .
" the woman of my dreams must be gentle , loving and a loyal companion , " he added .
" she will be understanding of my forestry work , my social projects and my cultural ambitions . "
spoiled for choice it 's a tall order , but bild is already fielding responses from willing applicants , even if not all of them quite meet the criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's princess madeleine probably is n't interested ...
" the prince is such a sweetie , " starlet samira told the paper .
" i like older men and i fell in love with his blue eyes at first sight . "
she 's no stranger to heartache , either .
" like the prince , i 'm getting over a romantic disappointment , so we even have something in common . "
graphic designer emely has realized it 's always worth brushing up on your date 's hobbies .
" i think he 's so manly and mysterious , " she said .
" i 've even bought some books so i can read up on his family background . "
but most promising of all is frederike , a 24-year-old student .
" i 'm a country girl so i can help him out on his estates .

the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .

the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .

" we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution , while the us was planning last week to take this issue to the wto , " he told reuters .

on monday , the us filed suit against airbus and now , the european countermove , raises the stakes in the transatlantic dispute over state aid for aircraft giants boeing and airbus . the wto 's 148 members can face huge penalties if they are found to have breached the rules of global commerce and then fail to fall into line with its decisions . the wto said it received washington 's complaint on tuesday and that an initial hearing was scheduled for june 13 to set up a dispute settlement panel . the panel could take until 2006 to rule on the dispute , and with possible appeals by either side , a final decision may come even later . eu disappointed with us move after a visit to the wto 's geneva headquarters on tuesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said he was disappointed by the us move against airbus , which has overtaken boeing to lead the global civilian aircraft market .

" we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution , while the us was planning last week to take this issue to the wto , " he told reuters .
" this decision is highly regrettable for those that think the wto has better things to do with its time than referee a grudge fight . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us did n't act in good faith , he says the move pits washington and brussels squarely against each other in a months-long dispute that escalated after an april 11 deadline passed without a resolution .
on monday , the us filed suit against airbus and now , the european countermove , raises the stakes in the transatlantic dispute over state aid for aircraft giants boeing and airbus . the wto 's 148 members can face huge penalties if they are found to have breached the rules of global commerce and then fail to fall into line with its decisions . the wto said it received washington 's complaint on tuesday and that an initial hearing was scheduled for june 13 to set up a dispute settlement panel . the panel could take until 2006 to rule on the dispute , and with possible appeals by either side , a final decision may come even later . eu disappointed with us move after a visit to the wto 's geneva headquarters on tuesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said he was disappointed by the us move against airbus , which has overtaken boeing to lead the global civilian aircraft market . " airbus 's success is well earned , " mandelson told afp .
" it 's won through hard work , high technology and huge creativity , not by subsidies as boeing would like to pretend .
this decision is highly regrettable from the standpoint of all those who believe that the wto has better things to do with its time than referee this grudge fight of boeing against airbus . " the eu and us first filed requests for consultations at the wto in october - the formal opening shot in the wto 's dispute procedures - but later agreed to freeze the process as they tried to reach a settlement . washington 's wto complaint was announced shortly after mandelson had made a fresh proposal to resolve the dispute by trimming state aid to both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : number two now eu promised subsidies reduction on tuesday , mandelson hinted that he believed the us had acted in bad faith . " i think it is as well for the world to know that we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution while the united states was planning to take this matter to the wto , " he said . on monday , us trade representative rob portman said in a statement , however , that washington was unhappy because the eu had " only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them , " thereby not tackling us concerns head on and forcing washington 's hand . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " he said .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .
but whether it is just doodling or art is a question an exhibition in nuremberg is hoping to shed light on . gone are the days when the rage of the young men of the ' 68 generation would lead them to smearing political slogans on fences and walls during the night .
these days , the subversives are n't as concerned with the day 's political issues , rather , they prefer running around making creations that lie in the grey area between art and property destruction . one finds them on sides of building , on overpasses and trains - and now , in nuremberg 's main library .
they 're shrill , glowing , colorful and alive . " graffitti is half art , that is undisputable , " said siegfried leykamm , who has assembled this collection .
" and many museums are interested in these graffiti artists .
it is not considered art only because anything done outside lawful means usually is n't , no ' ifs ' ' ands ' or ' buts ' . " at the beginning is a " corpora delicti , " a 40 square-meter wood display of spray paint cans and pictures in a " legal " graffiti action .
covered with abstract figures , the board shows the exhibits off effectively .
it functions as the anchor to the 150 photographs of graffiti works , most of which come from the franconia region in southern germany . bildunterschrift : hard to prevent meaningless labels or ornaments in one , a dog pees , deceptively real , almost like in a trompe l 'oeil .
on a another wall , a comic-like bear sporting a crown grins and a monster tries to make the viewer jump in terror .
sometimes , ornamental initials appearing on train cars or factory walls are elegant and curved ; other times other times they are just meaningless jumbles . the pictures in the exposition are not computer-generated photos but actual reproductions of real work .

dutch voters are eligible to cast ballots in a june 1 referendum on the constitution , three days after the french go to the polls in their referendum .
the latest opinion polls indicate that more than 60 percent will oppose the eu constitution in the netherlands .
-lrb- ap photo / peter dejong -rrb- nevertheless , the eu commission in brussels reiterated that it is not making any contingency plans .
" there is still no plan b , " said spokeswoman francoise le bail .
" we have to wait for the next step tomorrow evening . " eu leaders have a chance to regroup at a june 16-17 summit in brussels but quite what they will be able to agree on then is unclear , with nine of the 25 countries having already ratified the treaty . french influence the constitution - designed to streamline and harmonize how the expanding bloc is run - must be ratified by every country to take effect . opinion polls suggest a 60 percent " no " vote in the netherlands , with many swayed by the same gripes as the french - opposition to eu enlargement , fear of identity loss and unhappiness with the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of netherlands jan peter balkenende dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende urged voters to make up their own mind in the first national referendum in the netherlands in two centuries .
" france can not tell us what to do , " balkenende said .
" the dutch should n't merely take the lead from the french , they must make their own choice . " a dutch " no " could trigger a domino effect with at least six other nations also due to hold referendums later , including euroskeptic britain , poland and denmark . british prime minister tony blair appears to be steering away from holding his planned vote next year on the back of the french defeat and likely dutch setback .
blair , whose country assumes the rotating eu presidency in july , has called for a " time for reflection " as europe mulls where to go next , and the british media said he would call off a referendum if the netherlands voted against the constitution . others worried articulating eu concerns , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany warned that the bloc faced a " massive problem " if the dutch rejected the constitution and britain decided against a referendum . " we know ... that after the french ' no ' the chance the dutch vote will be unsuccessful has greatly increased , " he said in a radio interview . if britain then backed away from a referendum , " this will become a massive problem . " in warsaw , president aleksander kwasniewski called for consultations in the next few days to allow it to take a " sovereign decision on the way and date of ratification . " one theoretical option would be to renegotiate the treaty and make it more palatable , but that has been rejected by leaders such as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country votes on september 27 .
he said it would be " senseless " to ask danes to vote on a treaty that could be rewritten .
" i will not accept that , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is europe 's motor forever stalled ?

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

under the aegis of the stasi archive - named the birthler behörde after its director , marianne birthler - a research group is now concluding work on what experts believe is the definitive source on east germany 's infamous secret police , handed back over to germany by the cia in 2003 . allegedly , it contains a few surprises .
in an interview with the magazine mut , project leader helmut müller-enbergs revealed that in the late 1980s , up to 18 secret agents with the stasi 's center for foreign espionage -lrb- hva -rrb- were active in the west german foreign ministry . west german universities were also infiltrated with informers more densely than previously believed , with 43 spies operating at berlin 's free university , and another 12 at the technical university .
as well as containing names of west germans working for the stasi , the report also lists some 20,000 to 30,000 east germans working unofficially as stasi informers in the four decades up to the fall of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " clearly , a file like this can clear up a lot of mysteries , " said christian booss , spokesperson with the birthler behörde . " when the rosewood file came to light , a lot of authorities decided that on the basis of its findings they 'd take a last opportunity before the statute of limitations runs out in 2006 to screen civil servants .
most of the applications have come from cdu-ruled states in eastern german states - saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringen .
since early 2004 , we 've had over 100,000 requests . " stasi and sport among those getting hot under the collar could be numerous figures from the world of sport . in the mid-1990s , the national olympic committee and the german sport association -lrb- dsb -rrb- set up a commission made up of sport representatives , administrators and former ddr civil rights activists .
its task was to investigate the extent of the stasi 's role in east german sport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a recent bundestag report presented by marianne birthler and dsb president manfred von richthofen confirmed , many feel that its mandate has been too limited - one key problem being that the commission can only investigate individuals in response to specific requests . academics , politicians and stasi victims have now joined forces to call for a more extensive probe , based on similar lines to the three-year investigation into communist infiltration of german public broadcaster ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giselher spitzer , a sports historian , is the initiator of the " berlin declaration , " a project set up in september 2004 by victims of stasi intrigue and doping which demands german sports organizations launch more stringent inquiries into east germany 's state-sanctioned manipulation of its sports industry . winfried hermann from the green party agrees that that the existing commission 's research has been inadequate . " white-washing the past is not fair to the victims of the problem , " he told die welt . still relevant and according to spitzer , the problem is still highly topical . " there is evidence to suggest that individuals who have been identified as stasi agents are returning to sports , " he said , pointing to examples of former collaborators who now hold senior positions in the north german soccer association -lrb- nofv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a highly controversial move , the interior ministry last year invited east germany 's former national team coach bernd stange -lrb- who went on to train the iraqi national team under saddam hussein -rrb- to a symposium in leipzig on the world cup 2006 .
according to the birthler behörde , stange -lrb- photo -rrb- was a stasi informer for 14 years . most recently , roland gehrke , trainer of the up-and-coming luckenwalde wrestling club , was revealed to have been an informer between 1977 and 1988 , allegedly passing on information about his colleagues ' extra-marital affairs , sexual orientation , drinking habits and political leanings . taking offendors to task spitzer maintains that by 1989 , the stasi had enlisted some 3,000 informers from within east germany 's sporting ranks .
how many of them are still working in the industry today is unknown , primarily because few authorities have ever initiated investigations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " according to german sports law , no one who worked for the stasi or treated athletes with steroids is allowed to hold a top position , " said spitzer , referring to the case of wolfgang nitschke , the trainer of the german wrestling team who was dismissed last november .
" the berlin declaration says that in cases of conflict , the state should withdraw funding from associations which fail to dismiss guilty parties . "
as it stands , associations prefer to turn a blind eye - for two reasons .
" on the one hand , there can never be complete certainty about just how dangerous agent activity was , " explained spitzer .
" and on the other hand , many of these trainers are key to sporting success and no one wants to see them dismissed . " " widespread lack of awareness means the issue continues to be treated as harmless , " he stressed .
" ultimately , that means that former stasi agents will be allowed to set the pace in german sports .

dutch voters are eligible to cast ballots in a june 1 referendum on the constitution , three days after the french go to the polls in their referendum .
the latest opinion polls indicate that more than 60 percent will oppose the eu constitution in the netherlands .
-lrb- ap photo / peter dejong -rrb- nevertheless , the eu commission in brussels reiterated that it is not making any contingency plans .
" there is still no plan b , " said spokeswoman francoise le bail .
" we have to wait for the next step tomorrow evening . " eu leaders have a chance to regroup at a june 16-17 summit in brussels but quite what they will be able to agree on then is unclear , with nine of the 25 countries having already ratified the treaty . french influence the constitution - designed to streamline and harmonize how the expanding bloc is run - must be ratified by every country to take effect . opinion polls suggest a 60 percent " no " vote in the netherlands , with many swayed by the same gripes as the french - opposition to eu enlargement , fear of identity loss and unhappiness with the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of netherlands jan peter balkenende dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende urged voters to make up their own mind in the first national referendum in the netherlands in two centuries .
" france can not tell us what to do , " balkenende said .
" the dutch should n't merely take the lead from the french , they must make their own choice . " a dutch " no " could trigger a domino effect with at least six other nations also due to hold referendums later , including euroskeptic britain , poland and denmark . british prime minister tony blair appears to be steering away from holding his planned vote next year on the back of the french defeat and likely dutch setback .
blair , whose country assumes the rotating eu presidency in july , has called for a " time for reflection " as europe mulls where to go next , and the british media said he would call off a referendum if the netherlands voted against the constitution . others worried articulating eu concerns , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany warned that the bloc faced a " massive problem " if the dutch rejected the constitution and britain decided against a referendum . " we know ... that after the french ' no ' the chance the dutch vote will be unsuccessful has greatly increased , " he said in a radio interview . if britain then backed away from a referendum , " this will become a massive problem . " in warsaw , president aleksander kwasniewski called for consultations in the next few days to allow it to take a " sovereign decision on the way and date of ratification . " one theoretical option would be to renegotiate the treaty and make it more palatable , but that has been rejected by leaders such as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country votes on september 27 .
he said it would be " senseless " to ask danes to vote on a treaty that could be rewritten .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .

on the occasion of world no tobacco day , a look at an unusually straightforward program . pamphlets ?
posters ?
forget it .
the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .
before their day even started , they got their first lesson in the less than pleasant long-term effects of smoking .
on their way into the building , they passed three pale men in jogging outfits and flip flops - clearly patients - who were standing outside the hospital doors , smoking .
the men looked old , their faces deeply lined and their hair and skin had an unhealthy yellow tinge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu officials have considered putting pictures like this one on cigarette packs one of the students who visited the clinic was the 15 year old jens - himself a smoker for more than a year .
in fact , just prior to the clinic visit , jens said , he had a smoke .
when asked what he expected to get out of the project , he said he was n't sure .
he just hoped it would 't be " too boring . "
but he was nonetheless worried about the group 's plan to watch a lung endoscopy .
" i have nothing against blood and stuff , but it 's probably not so great to have to look at a black lung , " he said .
long-term success ?
the project is one of a growing array of education efforts in germany , aimed at reducing smoking or scaring kids off of ever starting .
the hope is that by looking at black lungs and endoscopies , students like jens will be so terrified they will quit smoking .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while " no butts " project leader michael ehmann said that such shock-tactic education often has an immediate resonance - most attendees leave his seminars vowing to quit - he added it often fails to translate into quitting smoking .
he still continues to provide information , hoping that the facts he transmits will help combat the idealized images of smoking shown in the media .
and he especially aims to reach those kids who have not yet started to smoke , but who might want to some day .
" i would like it if youths had 100 percent of the information , early enough , before they even get into the whole smoking thing , " said ehmann , himself an ex-smoker .
' avoidable risk ' ehmann 's tactic with the students is to load them up with facts .
they sit in an amphitheater while he delivers a talk via cordless microphone .
his speech is short on pleading or criticism , long on facts and clear messages .
" for you , it 's the single most important , avoidable health risk in the western world : whether to light up or not .
it 's your choice .
none of my business .
but first you have to know the information , " ehmann began and then proceeded to deliver anti-smoking information for the better part of an hour .
despite the length of the talk , the kids stayed surprisingly quiet .
" it is a little exhausting to just sit and listen all the time , " jens said .
" but if you really listen , it is actually interesting what you can learn . "
shock tactics after the talk came the part with shock value : a video of a lung endoscopy was projected up on a large screen .
during the endoscopy , a camera probe was sent into the lungs of a patient ; endoscopies are used by physicians to view the damage to an internal organ and take tissue samples , among other things .
during the video , the operating surgeon explained what he was doing as he pushed the probe into the patient 's mouth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth with cigarette " those are some traces of blood that come from cancer ... " he said .
the last part of the talk was perhaps the most effective .
a lanky man , his right leg in a plaster cast , limped before the audience .
he was introduced as a 54-year-old with lung cancer , but the disease has spread into his legs .
he told the students about his tobacco addiction ; how he smoked his first cigarette at age 10 and eventually worked his way up to three packs a day .
even today , he said , he ca n't give up cigarettes despite his illness .
from legs to lungs the room was silent as he told about his diagnosis .
" i asked the doctor , ' what do i have ? '
he said , ' a tumor in your leg ' .
so i came down here to heidelberg , to a super doctor , and she said , ' now we have to take a sample and see if it has moved into the bone . '
so they did .
and two days later , i came down here .
and they told me ... "
but the patient could n't say the words " they told me i had lung cancer , " so he was unable to finish his story .
instead , he broke down in tears .
his appearance clearly affected the kids who were watching .
" no way am i going to smoke a cigarette right now , " jens said .
" i really felt sorry for that old man .
truthfully , i do n't want to end up that way .
i 'm going to quit smoking . "
in this case , then , ehmann has done his job .
he only hopes that the combination of facts and the firsthand knowledge of the illnesses caused by smoking will make jens ' and others like him stick to their promise to quit . sabine vossen -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking the european union is stepping up its anti-smoking campaign with television advertisements aiming to ridicule the habit , its executive arm said on thursday .

the " no butts " project in the german town of heidelberg takes a much more aggressive approach to antismoking education .
it brings german youths between 12 and 17 to a hospital specializing in lung disease , giving them a firsthand look at the devastation wrought by smoking .
in germany , 300 people die each day from tobacco-related illnesses , according to figures put out by the german state of saxony .
one quarter of all german 15-year-olds smoke .
and while the overall percentage of teenage smokers has leveled off recently , the numbers of female teen smokers has soared in the past decade , from 16 percent in 1993 to 35 percent in 2004 .
yellow skin , black lungs on a recent visit to the thorax clinic in heidelberg , some 60 teenagers from the bonhoeffer technical school came for a day of education and confrontation .

" the united states announced monday that it will file a request for the establishment of a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- dispute settlement panel to resolve the dispute .
the panel request will be filed on tuesday , may 31 , " the ustr statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson the us complaint was announced here as a spokeswoman for european union trade chief peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- said monday that mandelson had written to his us counterparts with a fresh proposal to resolve the transatlantic row over subsidies for airplane makers airbus and boeing . illegal aid the simmering dispute over aid to airbus and boeing has become inflamed lately after airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . " for almost a year , the united states has tried to convince the eu to negotiate an end to subsidies for large civil aircraft , " us trade representative rob portman said in the statement .
" so we were pleased when , on jan .
11 of this year , the eu agreed to a standstill on launch aid while we negotiated an end to subsidies .
unfortunately , at this point , the eu is no longer willing to hold off on launch aid , and has only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them . " a balanced approach meanwhile , in brussels , mandelson 's spokeswoman claude veron-reville said earlier monday that the eu trade chief 's proposal renews a call for a balanced approach to the dispute . " peter mandelson is making it clear what we are ready to do and this is why he has made a fresh proposal , " she said .
" he has repeated our proposal and that we are willing to negotiate rather than go the wto . " the ustr said that by requesting the arbitration panel , washington is providing time for the eu to reconsider its plans to provide new subsidies and recommit to the deal struck in january . " this would include an immediate halt to any further steps toward providing new launch aid and a recommitment that the purpose of the negotiations is to end new subsidies for large civil aircraft -lrb- lca -rrb- , and not merely to reduce them , " the ustr said . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " portman said , noting that out of the 100 concluded wto cases involving the us since the wto was founded , over a third were satisfactorily resolved following negotiation .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " months of negotiation the eu and the us have been trying for months to negotiate an agreement to end their dispute over commercial aviation , to avoid taking the case down the perilous wto route . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington insists that over its 35-year history , airbus has benefited from massive amounts of member state and eu subsidies that have enabled the company to create a full product line of aircraft and gain a 50-percent share of large civilian aircraft sales and a 60 percent share of the global order book . every major airbus aircraft model , they argue , was financed , in whole or in part , with eu government subsidies taking the form of " launch aid " - financing with no or low rates of interest , and repayment tied to sales of the aircraft . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , us spar over new airbus aid the european union said thursday it still hopes to resolve a row with the united states over aircraft subsidies without resorting to legal action , despite a new aid request by airbus which risks re-igniting the dispute .
-lrb- may 19 , 2005 -rrb- airbus giant soars into history books the airbus a380 , the biggest airliner ever built , completed a momentous maiden flight on wednesday , winning praise across europe as a " magnificent machine " and opening a new era in aviation history .

recent political events in france and germany underscore the weakness of the alliance provides the motor of europe 's economy .

indeed , the french " no " vote sunday and german chancellor gerhard schröder 's defeat in a key state election the previous weekend threaten an all-out stall for europe 's already sputtering franco-german motor .
" what the result means is that the franco-german axis is in serious trouble .
it 's the end of a phase which began in 2002 , " said charles powell , senior researcher at the elcano royal institute think tank in madrid .

"
on tuesday , chirac also reacted to the vote by appointing dominique de villepin as his new prime minister in a major government reshuffle .
villepin , the 51-year-old former foreign minister who earned a worldwide reputation for his impassioned defense of france 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , replaces the deeply unpopular jean-pierre raffarin . raffarin was named prime minister in 2002 , upon president jacques chirac 's re-election to a second term .
villepin had served as the country 's interior minister until tuesday .

lack of sympathy " france is complicating the construction of europe .
so there is no reason for anyone to feel any particular sympathy for the country , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot .

they have lost the " ability to attract majorities " for their proposals .
waning political power according to alfred grosser , a french political science and history expert , chirac and schröder have been widely discredited by recent events .
" they will be severely weakened in the eyes of the other member states at the european union summit in mid-june , " he said .

recent political events in france and germany underscore the weakness of the alliance provides the motor of europe 's economy .
is the eu polticially hamstrung ? france 's rejection of the eu constitution strikes a further damaging blow to its already waning influence in the bloc , only a week after long-time eu partner germany was thrown into turmoil .

villepin , the 51-year-old former foreign minister who earned a worldwide reputation for his impassioned defense of france 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , replaces the deeply unpopular jean-pierre raffarin . raffarin was named prime minister in 2002 , upon president jacques chirac 's re-election to a second term .

dutch voters are eligible to cast ballots in a june 1 referendum on the constitution , three days after the french go to the polls in their referendum .
the latest opinion polls indicate that more than 60 percent will oppose the eu constitution in the netherlands .
-lrb- ap photo / peter dejong -rrb- nevertheless , the eu commission in brussels reiterated that it is not making any contingency plans .
" there is still no plan b , " said spokeswoman francoise le bail .
" we have to wait for the next step tomorrow evening . " eu leaders have a chance to regroup at a june 16-17 summit in brussels but quite what they will be able to agree on then is unclear , with nine of the 25 countries having already ratified the treaty . french influence the constitution - designed to streamline and harmonize how the expanding bloc is run - must be ratified by every country to take effect . opinion polls suggest a 60 percent " no " vote in the netherlands , with many swayed by the same gripes as the french - opposition to eu enlargement , fear of identity loss and unhappiness with the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of netherlands jan peter balkenende dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende urged voters to make up their own mind in the first national referendum in the netherlands in two centuries .
" france can not tell us what to do , " balkenende said .
" the dutch should n't merely take the lead from the french , they must make their own choice . " a dutch " no " could trigger a domino effect with at least six other nations also due to hold referendums later , including euroskeptic britain , poland and denmark . british prime minister tony blair appears to be steering away from holding his planned vote next year on the back of the french defeat and likely dutch setback .
blair , whose country assumes the rotating eu presidency in july , has called for a " time for reflection " as europe mulls where to go next , and the british media said he would call off a referendum if the netherlands voted against the constitution . others worried articulating eu concerns , hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany warned that the bloc faced a " massive problem " if the dutch rejected the constitution and britain decided against a referendum . " we know ... that after the french ' no ' the chance the dutch vote will be unsuccessful has greatly increased , " he said in a radio interview . if britain then backed away from a referendum , " this will become a massive problem . " in warsaw , president aleksander kwasniewski called for consultations in the next few days to allow it to take a " sovereign decision on the way and date of ratification . " one theoretical option would be to renegotiate the treaty and make it more palatable , but that has been rejected by leaders such as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country votes on september 27 .
he said it would be " senseless " to ask danes to vote on a treaty that could be rewritten .
" i will not accept that , " he told reporters . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is europe 's motor forever stalled ?

" we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution , while the us was planning last week to take this issue to the wto , " he told reuters .
" this decision is highly regrettable for those that think the wto has better things to do with its time than referee a grudge fight . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us did n't act in good faith , he says the move pits washington and brussels squarely against each other in a months-long dispute that escalated after an april 11 deadline passed without a resolution .
on monday , the us filed suit against airbus and now , the european countermove , raises the stakes in the transatlantic dispute over state aid for aircraft giants boeing and airbus . the wto 's 148 members can face huge penalties if they are found to have breached the rules of global commerce and then fail to fall into line with its decisions . the wto said it received washington 's complaint on tuesday and that an initial hearing was scheduled for june 13 to set up a dispute settlement panel . the panel could take until 2006 to rule on the dispute , and with possible appeals by either side , a final decision may come even later . eu disappointed with us move after a visit to the wto 's geneva headquarters on tuesday , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said he was disappointed by the us move against airbus , which has overtaken boeing to lead the global civilian aircraft market . " airbus 's success is well earned , " mandelson told afp .
" it 's won through hard work , high technology and huge creativity , not by subsidies as boeing would like to pretend .
this decision is highly regrettable from the standpoint of all those who believe that the wto has better things to do with its time than referee this grudge fight of boeing against airbus . " the eu and us first filed requests for consultations at the wto in october - the formal opening shot in the wto 's dispute procedures - but later agreed to freeze the process as they tried to reach a settlement . washington 's wto complaint was announced shortly after mandelson had made a fresh proposal to resolve the dispute by trimming state aid to both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : number two now eu promised subsidies reduction on tuesday , mandelson hinted that he believed the us had acted in bad faith . " i think it is as well for the world to know that we in europe were still seeking to negotiate an agreed solution while the united states was planning to take this matter to the wto , " he said . on monday , us trade representative rob portman said in a statement , however , that washington was unhappy because the eu had " only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them , " thereby not tackling us concerns head on and forcing washington 's hand . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " he said .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " washington had decided to take the case to the wto because that was the best way to prevent the aircraft dispute from spilling over into other tussles on steel duties and biotechnology , portman 's office said . on monday , after washington 's announcement , mandelson and portman had issued a joint statement . dispute will not affect other areas of cooperation " we remain united in our determination that this dispute shall not affect our cooperation on wider bilateral and multilateral trade issues , " they said .
" we have worked together well so far , and intend to continue to do so . " the dispute over aid to airbus and boeing was inflamed lately when airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal under wto rules , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us seeks arbitration over airbus subsidies the us will ask the world trade organization tuesday to create an arbitration panel to resolve a dispute over european subsidies to aircraft maker airbus , the us trade representative said in a statement .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty . " roth from the greens said german companies should express criticism over the trial and not remain silent in the hopes of improving their dealings with russia . harsh sentence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant and business partner platon lebedev stand behind bars during their trial in moscow , tuesday , may 17 , 2005 .
the moscow court reading the verdict in the politically charged trial of oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky adjourned tuesday without pronouncing a final decision , postponing the laborious process into a third day .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander zemlianichenko -rrb- the sentence was one year short of the maximum 10 years requested by prosecutors and was in line with wide expectation that khodorkovsky would be convicted .
co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .
defense lawyers have indicated they will appeal the verdict not just through russian judicial channels but possibly at the european court of human rights and through an international campaign of pressure against president vladimir putin 's government . irina khakamada , a leading putin critic , described the sentence as " aggressive and unjust . " " this verdict will allow not only the redistribution of assets to the benefit of the authorities but also the intimidation of everyone , " the liberal opposition lawmaker said on echo moscow radio station . yukos downfall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the logo of the russian oil giant yukos above a gas station .
the sentence handed down to the former yukos boss was to begin backdated to october 2003 , when he was arrested in siberia as he was about to board his private plane .
the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .
at the time of his arrest , he was believed to be russia 's richest man , worth an estimated $ 15 billion -lrb- 12.2 billion euros -rrb- according to fortune magazine . supporters said khodorkovsky is no worse than the other so-called " oligarchs , " the less than two dozen men who rose to the top of russia 's chaotic and freewheeling post-soviet move towards privatization . defenders underlined that under khodorkovsky , yukos became known in the west as russia 's most transparent and well-run company . many analysts and human rights defenders said his real mistake was to become actively involved in politics , funding opposition parties and , with his wealth and influence abroad , posing a threat to putin 's iron grip on power . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de western leaders criticize putin more than 100 american and european foreign policy experts signed a letter protesting against russian president vladimir putin 's leadership .

under the aegis of the stasi archive - named the birthler behörde after its director , marianne birthler - a research group is now concluding work on what experts believe is the definitive source on east germany 's infamous secret police , handed back over to germany by the cia in 2003 . allegedly , it contains a few surprises .
in an interview with the magazine mut , project leader helmut müller-enbergs revealed that in the late 1980s , up to 18 secret agents with the stasi 's center for foreign espionage -lrb- hva -rrb- were active in the west german foreign ministry . west german universities were also infiltrated with informers more densely than previously believed , with 43 spies operating at berlin 's free university , and another 12 at the technical university .
as well as containing names of west germans working for the stasi , the report also lists some 20,000 to 30,000 east germans working unofficially as stasi informers in the four decades up to the fall of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " clearly , a file like this can clear up a lot of mysteries , " said christian booss , spokesperson with the birthler behörde . " when the rosewood file came to light , a lot of authorities decided that on the basis of its findings they 'd take a last opportunity before the statute of limitations runs out in 2006 to screen civil servants .
most of the applications have come from cdu-ruled states in eastern german states - saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringen .
since early 2004 , we 've had over 100,000 requests . " stasi and sport among those getting hot under the collar could be numerous figures from the world of sport . in the mid-1990s , the national olympic committee and the german sport association -lrb- dsb -rrb- set up a commission made up of sport representatives , administrators and former ddr civil rights activists .
its task was to investigate the extent of the stasi 's role in east german sport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a recent bundestag report presented by marianne birthler and dsb president manfred von richthofen confirmed , many feel that its mandate has been too limited - one key problem being that the commission can only investigate individuals in response to specific requests . academics , politicians and stasi victims have now joined forces to call for a more extensive probe , based on similar lines to the three-year investigation into communist infiltration of german public broadcaster ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giselher spitzer , a sports historian , is the initiator of the " berlin declaration , " a project set up in september 2004 by victims of stasi intrigue and doping which demands german sports organizations launch more stringent inquiries into east germany 's state-sanctioned manipulation of its sports industry . winfried hermann from the green party agrees that that the existing commission 's research has been inadequate . " white-washing the past is not fair to the victims of the problem , " he told die welt . still relevant and according to spitzer , the problem is still highly topical . " there is evidence to suggest that individuals who have been identified as stasi agents are returning to sports , " he said , pointing to examples of former collaborators who now hold senior positions in the north german soccer association -lrb- nofv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a highly controversial move , the interior ministry last year invited east germany 's former national team coach bernd stange -lrb- who went on to train the iraqi national team under saddam hussein -rrb- to a symposium in leipzig on the world cup 2006 .
according to the birthler behörde , stange -lrb- photo -rrb- was a stasi informer for 14 years . most recently , roland gehrke , trainer of the up-and-coming luckenwalde wrestling club , was revealed to have been an informer between 1977 and 1988 , allegedly passing on information about his colleagues ' extra-marital affairs , sexual orientation , drinking habits and political leanings . taking offendors to task spitzer maintains that by 1989 , the stasi had enlisted some 3,000 informers from within east germany 's sporting ranks .

" the relations between our two countries have been through some difficult times which we have overcome .
we both know that in the next 40 years these relations will not be entirely normal and as clear as with other countries , " katsav added .
on wednesday , katsav will visit the new memorial in central berlin dedicated to the six million jews killed by the nazis .
the israeli president said israel is concerned by signs of anti-semitism in germany , but recognized official determination to fight it .
köhler had assured katsav that germany was making every effort to fight anti-semitism , especially by teaching children about the murder of six million jews by the nazis .
partnerships and exchanges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a bid to bind the two countries closer together , their presidents launched a " new fund for the future " to facilitate school exchanges and cultural and scientific partnerships between the two countries .

a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .
but whether it is just doodling or art is a question an exhibition in nuremberg is hoping to shed light on . gone are the days when the rage of the young men of the ' 68 generation would lead them to smearing political slogans on fences and walls during the night .
these days , the subversives are n't as concerned with the day 's political issues , rather , they prefer running around making creations that lie in the grey area between art and property destruction . one finds them on sides of building , on overpasses and trains - and now , in nuremberg 's main library .
they 're shrill , glowing , colorful and alive . " graffitti is half art , that is undisputable , " said siegfried leykamm , who has assembled this collection .
" and many museums are interested in these graffiti artists .
it is not considered art only because anything done outside lawful means usually is n't , no ' ifs ' ' ands ' or ' buts ' . " at the beginning is a " corpora delicti , " a 40 square-meter wood display of spray paint cans and pictures in a " legal " graffiti action .
covered with abstract figures , the board shows the exhibits off effectively .
it functions as the anchor to the 150 photographs of graffiti works , most of which come from the franconia region in southern germany . bildunterschrift : hard to prevent meaningless labels or ornaments in one , a dog pees , deceptively real , almost like in a trompe l 'oeil .
on a another wall , a comic-like bear sporting a crown grins and a monster tries to make the viewer jump in terror .
sometimes , ornamental initials appearing on train cars or factory walls are elegant and curved ; other times other times they are just meaningless jumbles . the pictures in the exposition are not computer-generated photos but actual reproductions of real work .
when interior minister otto schilly recently came up with an idea to use helicopters and infrared cameras to catch graffiti artists , leykamm says it was a bit of overkill . there are other ways to control graffiti , he adds : one has to find a dialogue between the authorities and the graffiti enthusiasts because with a ban and arrests and prosecutions , one wo n't solve anything . graffitti for centuries graffiti is not a modern-day phenomenon .
vikings drew pictures and scribbled little messages about themselves or their loves on sacred ancient burial sites after invading north scotland .
in this exhibition , there are photos of centuries-old scribblings etched on a 1516 built grain house belonging to a religious order - directly behind the police station there today . tomas senne -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grappling with graffiti 's darker side when it comes to graffiti , one man 's art is another man 's vandalism .

under the aegis of the stasi archive - named the birthler behörde after its director , marianne birthler - a research group is now concluding work on what experts believe is the definitive source on east germany 's infamous secret police , handed back over to germany by the cia in 2003 . allegedly , it contains a few surprises .
in an interview with the magazine mut , project leader helmut müller-enbergs revealed that in the late 1980s , up to 18 secret agents with the stasi 's center for foreign espionage -lrb- hva -rrb- were active in the west german foreign ministry . west german universities were also infiltrated with informers more densely than previously believed , with 43 spies operating at berlin 's free university , and another 12 at the technical university .
as well as containing names of west germans working for the stasi , the report also lists some 20,000 to 30,000 east germans working unofficially as stasi informers in the four decades up to the fall of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " clearly , a file like this can clear up a lot of mysteries , " said christian booss , spokesperson with the birthler behörde . " when the rosewood file came to light , a lot of authorities decided that on the basis of its findings they 'd take a last opportunity before the statute of limitations runs out in 2006 to screen civil servants .
most of the applications have come from cdu-ruled states in eastern german states - saxony , saxony-anhalt and thuringen .
since early 2004 , we 've had over 100,000 requests . " stasi and sport among those getting hot under the collar could be numerous figures from the world of sport . in the mid-1990s , the national olympic committee and the german sport association -lrb- dsb -rrb- set up a commission made up of sport representatives , administrators and former ddr civil rights activists .
its task was to investigate the extent of the stasi 's role in east german sport . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as a recent bundestag report presented by marianne birthler and dsb president manfred von richthofen confirmed , many feel that its mandate has been too limited - one key problem being that the commission can only investigate individuals in response to specific requests . academics , politicians and stasi victims have now joined forces to call for a more extensive probe , based on similar lines to the three-year investigation into communist infiltration of german public broadcaster ard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giselher spitzer , a sports historian , is the initiator of the " berlin declaration , " a project set up in september 2004 by victims of stasi intrigue and doping which demands german sports organizations launch more stringent inquiries into east germany 's state-sanctioned manipulation of its sports industry . winfried hermann from the green party agrees that that the existing commission 's research has been inadequate . " white-washing the past is not fair to the victims of the problem , " he told die welt . still relevant and according to spitzer , the problem is still highly topical . " there is evidence to suggest that individuals who have been identified as stasi agents are returning to sports , " he said , pointing to examples of former collaborators who now hold senior positions in the north german soccer association -lrb- nofv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a highly controversial move , the interior ministry last year invited east germany 's former national team coach bernd stange -lrb- who went on to train the iraqi national team under saddam hussein -rrb- to a symposium in leipzig on the world cup 2006 .
according to the birthler behörde , stange -lrb- photo -rrb- was a stasi informer for 14 years . most recently , roland gehrke , trainer of the up-and-coming luckenwalde wrestling club , was revealed to have been an informer between 1977 and 1988 , allegedly passing on information about his colleagues ' extra-marital affairs , sexual orientation , drinking habits and political leanings . taking offendors to task spitzer maintains that by 1989 , the stasi had enlisted some 3,000 informers from within east germany 's sporting ranks .
how many of them are still working in the industry today is unknown , primarily because few authorities have ever initiated investigations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " according to german sports law , no one who worked for the stasi or treated athletes with steroids is allowed to hold a top position , " said spitzer , referring to the case of wolfgang nitschke , the trainer of the german wrestling team who was dismissed last november .
" the berlin declaration says that in cases of conflict , the state should withdraw funding from associations which fail to dismiss guilty parties . "
as it stands , associations prefer to turn a blind eye - for two reasons .
" on the one hand , there can never be complete certainty about just how dangerous agent activity was , " explained spitzer .
" and on the other hand , many of these trainers are key to sporting success and no one wants to see them dismissed . " " widespread lack of awareness means the issue continues to be treated as harmless , " he stressed .
" ultimately , that means that former stasi agents will be allowed to set the pace in german sports .

the european union declined to comment on the matter . khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a politically-charged trial that critics saw as a kremlin vendetta against russia 's once-richest man .
the co-leader of germany 's greens party , claudia roth , said the verdict was the result of a " show trial " that was unfair from the outset . " the loser of this trial is n't only mikhail khordorkovsky , but also the rule of law and democracy in russia , " roth said in a statement .
" it shows just how controlled and unfree the russian justice system is . " similar sentiment was expressed by the secretary general of bavaria 's conservative christian social union , markus söder , who also criticized the outcome as " having little to do with democracy . " us congressman tom lantos , in moscow for the verdict , went even further : " it seems that this political trial , tried before this kangaroo court , has come to a shameful conclusion , " representative lantos told journalists outside the courthouse shortly after judges sentenced khodorkovsky . no comment from eu the european union chose not to comment directly on the verdict , but said it would continue to urge russia to develop a favorable climate for investors .
" we will not comment on the details of the charges nor on the sentence in this case , " emma udwin , spokeswoman for external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , told reporters in brussels . " we have other opportunities and use them to explain to our russian partners that it would be in their interest to create a climate for investors and business more generally that is transparent and non discriminatory , " she said . anton börner , the president of the german trade association -lrb- bga -rrb- , said he did n't expect any impact on german companies doing business with russia due to the verdict .
" russia is in the middle of a serious reform process that also affects the justice system , " he said .
" the strong growth of the russian market more than offset some uncertainty .

co-defendant platon lebedev , one of khodorkovsky 's former business associates , was also found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison . chief justice irina kolesnikova said the decision by a three-judge panel could be appealed to a higher judicial authority within 10 days . the russian state prosecutor 's office described the verdict and sentencing as " fair and objective . " " it corresponds to the real circumstances of the affair and to the seriousness of the crimes committed by the accused , " natalya vishnyakova , a spokeswoman for the prosecutor general 's office , said in a statement reported by interfax news agency . another spokesman for the prosecutor general 's office confirmed that the state would " soon " file new charges against khodorkovsky and lebedev in connection with a separate money-laundering investigation . khodorkovsky and lebedev were expected to remain in detention in moscow pending an expected appeals process which could drag on for months or even years .

the trial , which began in june last year , has sparked widespread international criticism and shaken the confidence of international investors . the authorities described khodorkovsky , 41 , as a robber baron who bought yukos on the cheap during the murky and unregulated privatization process of the early 1990s .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " according to german sports law , no one who worked for the stasi or treated athletes with steroids is allowed to hold a top position , " said spitzer , referring to the case of wolfgang nitschke , the trainer of the german wrestling team who was dismissed last november .
" the berlin declaration says that in cases of conflict , the state should withdraw funding from associations which fail to dismiss guilty parties . "
as it stands , associations prefer to turn a blind eye - for two reasons .
" on the one hand , there can never be complete certainty about just how dangerous agent activity was , " explained spitzer .
" and on the other hand , many of these trainers are key to sporting success and no one wants to see them dismissed . " " widespread lack of awareness means the issue continues to be treated as harmless , " he stressed .
" ultimately , that means that former stasi agents will be allowed to set the pace in german sports .

a wall .
and presto , there is graffiti .
but whether it is just doodling or art is a question an exhibition in nuremberg is hoping to shed light on . gone are the days when the rage of the young men of the ' 68 generation would lead them to smearing political slogans on fences and walls during the night .
these days , the subversives are n't as concerned with the day 's political issues , rather , they prefer running around making creations that lie in the grey area between art and property destruction . one finds them on sides of building , on overpasses and trains - and now , in nuremberg 's main library .
they 're shrill , glowing , colorful and alive . " graffitti is half art , that is undisputable , " said siegfried leykamm , who has assembled this collection .
" and many museums are interested in these graffiti artists .
it is not considered art only because anything done outside lawful means usually is n't , no ' ifs ' ' ands ' or ' buts ' . " at the beginning is a " corpora delicti , " a 40 square-meter wood display of spray paint cans and pictures in a " legal " graffiti action .
covered with abstract figures , the board shows the exhibits off effectively .
it functions as the anchor to the 150 photographs of graffiti works , most of which come from the franconia region in southern germany . bildunterschrift : hard to prevent meaningless labels or ornaments in one , a dog pees , deceptively real , almost like in a trompe l 'oeil .
on a another wall , a comic-like bear sporting a crown grins and a monster tries to make the viewer jump in terror .
sometimes , ornamental initials appearing on train cars or factory walls are elegant and curved ; other times other times they are just meaningless jumbles . the pictures in the exposition are not computer-generated photos but actual reproductions of real work .
when interior minister otto schilly recently came up with an idea to use helicopters and infrared cameras to catch graffiti artists , leykamm says it was a bit of overkill . there are other ways to control graffiti , he adds : one has to find a dialogue between the authorities and the graffiti enthusiasts because with a ban and arrests and prosecutions , one wo n't solve anything . graffitti for centuries graffiti is not a modern-day phenomenon .
vikings drew pictures and scribbled little messages about themselves or their loves on sacred ancient burial sites after invading north scotland .
in this exhibition , there are photos of centuries-old scribblings etched on a 1516 built grain house belonging to a religious order - directly behind the police station there today . tomas senne -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : grappling with graffiti 's darker side when it comes to graffiti , one man 's art is another man 's vandalism .

" the united states announced monday that it will file a request for the establishment of a world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- dispute settlement panel to resolve the dispute .
the panel request will be filed on tuesday , may 31 , " the ustr statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter mandelson the us complaint was announced here as a spokeswoman for european union trade chief peter mandelson -lrb- photo -rrb- said monday that mandelson had written to his us counterparts with a fresh proposal to resolve the transatlantic row over subsidies for airplane makers airbus and boeing . illegal aid the simmering dispute over aid to airbus and boeing has become inflamed lately after airbus requested british government aid for its a350 long-haul plane designed to compete with boeing 's plans to launch the 787 dreamliner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united states believes financial aid given to airbus to launch new aircraft is illegal , while the europeans accuse washington of subsidizing boeing through military contracts . " for almost a year , the united states has tried to convince the eu to negotiate an end to subsidies for large civil aircraft , " us trade representative rob portman said in the statement .
" so we were pleased when , on jan .
11 of this year , the eu agreed to a standstill on launch aid while we negotiated an end to subsidies .
unfortunately , at this point , the eu is no longer willing to hold off on launch aid , and has only proposed to reduce subsidies , not end them . " a balanced approach meanwhile , in brussels , mandelson 's spokeswoman claude veron-reville said earlier monday that the eu trade chief 's proposal renews a call for a balanced approach to the dispute . " peter mandelson is making it clear what we are ready to do and this is why he has made a fresh proposal , " she said .
" he has repeated our proposal and that we are willing to negotiate rather than go the wto . " the ustr said that by requesting the arbitration panel , washington is providing time for the eu to reconsider its plans to provide new subsidies and recommit to the deal struck in january . " this would include an immediate halt to any further steps toward providing new launch aid and a recommitment that the purpose of the negotiations is to end new subsidies for large civil aircraft -lrb- lca -rrb- , and not merely to reduce them , " the ustr said . " we still believe that a bilateral negotiated solution is possible , " portman said , noting that out of the 100 concluded wto cases involving the us since the wto was founded , over a third were satisfactorily resolved following negotiation .
" but the negotiations wo n't succeed unless the eu recommits to ending subsidies . " months of negotiation the eu and the us have been trying for months to negotiate an agreement to end their dispute over commercial aviation , to avoid taking the case down the perilous wto route . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington insists that over its 35-year history , airbus has benefited from massive amounts of member state and eu subsidies that have enabled the company to create a full product line of aircraft and gain a 50-percent share of large civilian aircraft sales and a 60 percent share of the global order book . every major airbus aircraft model , they argue , was financed , in whole or in part , with eu government subsidies taking the form of " launch aid " - financing with no or low rates of interest , and repayment tied to sales of the aircraft . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu , us spar over new airbus aid the european union said thursday it still hopes to resolve a row with the united states over aircraft subsidies without resorting to legal action , despite a new aid request by airbus which risks re-igniting the dispute .

the country is suffering its first outbreak of the disease for nearly a decade , with 16 cases reported so far .
the disease , spread by contaminated water , is incurable and causes paralysis and sometimes death .
officials believe the outbreak can be traced to nigeria , where vaccinations were suspended in 2003 , after radical clerics said they were a us plot .
dna tests done on a viral sample from one of the infected children has determined that the polio arrived in indonesia via saudi arabia .
indonesian officials say the virus could have been picked up by a pilgrim on the hajj to mecca , or a migrant worker .
polio is still endemic in six countries - afghanistan , egypt , india , nigeria , niger and pakistan .
the united nations has been campaigning to eradicate the disease by the end of this year .
enthusiastic response indonesia first detected a case in west java province , 120km -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- east of the capital , jakarta , last month .
children in villages in the area have already been vaccinated .
polio vaccination rates across indonesia as a whole stand at about 90 % , but in western java the rate has been around 55 % .
" this is important because i do n't want my child to be disabled like the ones i see on television , " said nasah , 21 , told reuters news agency , as she brought her 3-year-old son septyan to a vaccination station .
the vaccine is administered in liquid form , with two drops being squeezed into each child 's mouth .
" the people have been very enthusiastic so far today .
the health centres are crowded , " dr muhammad nadirin , a health ministry official , told the ap news agency .
he said a second round of vaccinations would take place next month .

owd betts inn , named after the building 's 19th century owner elizabeth ashworth , attracts visitors from as far away as australia , the us and canada .
and it is frequented by celebrities , including some of the cast from coronation street .
but it seems the nature of the surrounding area is going to change quite dramatically after government approval of a controversial £ 50m windfarm on scout moor - about half-a-mile from owd betts .
twenty-six 80m-high turbines - two thirds the size of blackpool tower - will generate 65 megawatts of electricity for about 30,000 homes .
it is part of the government 's attempt to meet its climate change commitments and build reliable energy supplies .
a lot of people have mixed feelings about it audrey lambert those opposed to the windfarm in this particular location speak of problems with increased traffic , damage to an untouched landscape and the noise of the turbines as their blades turn in the wind .
owd betts will be one of the nearest buildings to the windfarm .
proprietors david and audrey lambert are philosophical about the project , though they are concerned about the effect it could have on their water supply .
the lamberts are on a well system and use their own elaborate filtration system to ensure the water , taken from nearby springs , is fit to use on their premises .
mr lambert says he has been told by an engineer that the water could turn black if the surrounding peatland is disturbed .
" when the water turns dirty and black , that 's when a borehole system has to kick in and who 's going to be responsible for fitting the borehole ? " he said .
the lamberts say visitors to the pub come from far and wide " this is n't our doing because if they leave it alone , it will be right as it is ; if they mess about with it there are going to be costly problems all year every year . "
they plan to write to peel holdings which is behind the windfarm scheme and whose portfolio includes the trafford centre - a shopping complex just outside manchester - and liverpool john lennon airport .
richard brewster from peel holdings said the company had " more than adequately demonstrated that there will be no negative impact on water supply " .
however , he said that anybody with any concerns should contact peel holdings .
the scheme will have a linked community trust to invest £ 1m into local projects over the course of the windfarm 's operational life .
apart from the potential water problem , the lamberts do not believe the proximity of the turbines will have a detrimental effect on trade .
' not been spoilt ' mr lambert said : " the windfarm is going to be round the back and both the business and our flat are situated at the front .
" it 's not just about the water going black , though , what about all the wildlife and plantation dying off , and people who love to come and walk up here ?
it will have a lot of knock-on effects . "
mrs lambert said : " a lot of people have mixed feelings about it .
" i do n't think it will affect the business because people will come to look at the turbines and it could even help it if they visit us while they are up here . "
for better or for worse , the winds of change are blowing around owd betts .

two new studies reject the theory that humans moving on to the continent more than 42,000 years ago took out its megafauna in a 1,000-year " blitzkrieg " .
the studies suggest instead a more complex pattern to the extinctions .
their authors say humans certainly had a role but it was not as important as the period 's climate changes .
the studies are published this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- and in memoirs of the queensland museum .
however , other researchers who believe the continent 's megafauna did suffer a catastrophe at the hands of humans have told bbc news they are not persuaded by the new data .
' guilt by association ' migrating humans have been blamed for the quick disappearance of large creatures both in the northern and southern hemisphere .
in north america , for example , the demise of mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers at the end of the pleistocene epoch is coincident with the arrival on the landmass of new stone-spear technologies carried by humans about 12,000 years ago .
i do n't doubt the first aboriginals did hunt megafauna but the argument that they did it with the efficiency required to effect near-instantaneous extinction is not , in my view , credible dr stephen wroe , university of sydney and in australia , the extinction of great beasts - such as the marsupial lion -lrb- thylacoleo carnifex -rrb- , the immense wombat-like diprotodon optatum and the 400kg lizard megalania prisca - also occurred at roughly the same time humans appeared on the scene .
previous research had even indicated a very rapid removal of the megafauna , in perhaps as little as a thousand years .
but in their pnas paper , clive trueman , from the university of portsmouth , uk , and colleagues in australia argue evidence for the involvement of human overkill in the southern extinction is largely circumstantial - " guilt by association " .
they report detailed new dating data on fossils found at cuddie springs in new south wales .
these suggest humans lived side by side with the great beasts of australia for at least 10-12,000 years .
it gives the lie , they claim , to the notion that humans rapidly removed the large animals either by hunting or by changing the landscape through burning .
instead , the team argues for a more complex explanation of megafaunal extinction in which large climate shifts played a significant role .
australia had an exotic collection of large mammals , such as marsupial lions these saw temperatures plummet and the lush landscape become arid by about 30-35,000 years ago .
" these findings demonstrate that extinction was a gradual process , strongly implicating climate change as the driving mechanism , " said co-author dr judith field , from the university of sydney .
" the role of humans in this process has yet to be established .
" more broadly , these findings suggest that the spread of modern humans to new regions did not necessarily result in unsustainable hunting and mass extinction of the native fauna . "
also , the researchers believe humans simply would not have had the hunting technologies to take out so many large creatures .
" there is not a single stone-spearpoint in australia until , at the very earliest , about 15,000 years ago - long after anyone thinks the megafauna went extinct , " co-author dr stephen wroe , from the university of sydney , told the bbc news website .
" you try taking out a two-to-three-tonne wombat with a pointy stick .
" i do n't doubt the first aboriginals did hunt megafauna but the argument that they did it with the efficiency required to effect near-instantaneous extinction is not , in my view , credible . "
small and big this analysis fits with the second paper , published by gilbert price , of queensland university of technology .
his view is that the colder , drier climate changed the types of animals that could survive in the region of australia he studied .
gilbert price studied fossils from queensland he found that the patterns of fossils in a creek bed in the darling downs area of south-east queensland suggested that other , smaller species also disappeared with the larger ones .
the shift in the fossils found in the 10m-deep section of creek bed mirrored the changes to the environment as woodland and scrubland gave way to grassland , he told memoirs of the queensland museum .
mr price said that many of the fossils found pre-dated human activity in the area , absolving humans from any involvement in their extinction .
" we 've done a little bit of radiocarbon dating on the deposits themselves and we know that the age of the deposits pre-dates the first humans on the darling downs by about 30-35,000 years , " he told the australian broadcasting corporation .
" we know that there 're no human or cultural artefacts in the deposits as well , and we know that all the cut marks on the bones are related to predation by some of the other species that lived on the darling downs , such as marsupial lions . "
dating doubts the possible role of humans in the demise of the megafauna is a hot topic in australian palaeontology .
the controversy was given extra impetus in 2001 when a paper published in the journal science reported new dating data for fossil-containing sediments from 28 sites across australia and papua new guinea .
the results suggested the great beasts had all gone by about 46,000 years ago - long before the dramatic climate changes brought on by the last glacial maximum , but late enough for the extinctions to have occurred in the presence of humans .
i would have been convinced if they had dated the bones directly by a reliable means - no easy task , i can assure you professor bert roberts , university of wollongong some took this as clear support for the blitzkrieg theory .
others still think events unfolded more slowly , and hold to the idea that humans caused catastrophic damage to animal habitats as they burned the landscape to drive game out into the open .
the cuddie springs site is crucial to the debate because it contains what appear to be some of the youngest fossils .
however , it is one of a number of sites which could have been disturbed , with previously buried bones being introduced into younger sediments .
if correct , this would mean that dates from such sites are unreliable .
the pnas team has attempted to resolve this issue by comparing the rare earth elements -lrb- ree -rrb- incorporated into bone fragments found at different levels within the cuddie springs sediments .
" when an animal dies and is buried , -lsb- these -rsb- elements in the local environment are adsorbed into its bones , forming a permanent ' fingerprint ' of the original burial locality .
fossils deposited at different times will have different concentrations of these elements , " said dr trueman .
the team believes this ree approach has proved that bones in each layer came from animals that lived and died together - that the sediments were not disturbed and the younger dates stand up .
but the lead author of the 2001 science paper , professor bert roberts , of the university of wollongong , told bbc news he still had doubts .
" the problem with using ree on such young deposits is the assumption -lrb- made by trueman et al -rrb- that ree are taken up soon after burial of the bones and that they then stay ' locked in ' .
" one of the papers they cite in support of this ' rapid uptake ' assumption in fact says that ree take 10,000 to 30,000 years to accumulate in bone .
" this length of time is trivial for bones that are millions of years old , but it matters if - as at cuddie springs - you 're looking at bones that are only a few tens of thousands of years old . "
in other words , ree information in older , eroded bones could get " overprinted " with younger dates if the specimens had been disturbed into more recent sediments .
he added : " i would have been convinced if they had dated the bones directly by a reliable means - no easy task , i can assure you .
" radiocarbon dating has already been tried twice , and failed on both occasions . "

two new studies reject the theory that humans moving on to the continent more than 42,000 years ago took out its megafauna in a 1,000-year " blitzkrieg " .
the studies suggest instead a more complex pattern to the extinctions .
their authors say humans certainly had a role but it was not as important as the period 's climate changes .
the studies are published this week in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- and in memoirs of the queensland museum .
however , other researchers who believe the continent 's megafauna did suffer a catastrophe at the hands of humans have told bbc news they are not persuaded by the new data .
' guilt by association ' migrating humans have been blamed for the quick disappearance of large creatures both in the northern and southern hemisphere .
in north america , for example , the demise of mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers at the end of the pleistocene epoch is coincident with the arrival on the landmass of new stone-spear technologies carried by humans about 12,000 years ago .
i do n't doubt the first aboriginals did hunt megafauna but the argument that they did it with the efficiency required to effect near-instantaneous extinction is not , in my view , credible dr stephen wroe , university of sydney and in australia , the extinction of great beasts - such as the marsupial lion -lrb- thylacoleo carnifex -rrb- , the immense wombat-like diprotodon optatum and the 400kg lizard megalania prisca - also occurred at roughly the same time humans appeared on the scene .
previous research had even indicated a very rapid removal of the megafauna , in perhaps as little as a thousand years .
but in their pnas paper , clive trueman , from the university of portsmouth , uk , and colleagues in australia argue evidence for the involvement of human overkill in the southern extinction is largely circumstantial - " guilt by association " .
they report detailed new dating data on fossils found at cuddie springs in new south wales .
these suggest humans lived side by side with the great beasts of australia for at least 10-12,000 years .
it gives the lie , they claim , to the notion that humans rapidly removed the large animals either by hunting or by changing the landscape through burning .
instead , the team argues for a more complex explanation of megafaunal extinction in which large climate shifts played a significant role .
australia had an exotic collection of large mammals , such as marsupial lions these saw temperatures plummet and the lush landscape become arid by about 30-35,000 years ago .
" these findings demonstrate that extinction was a gradual process , strongly implicating climate change as the driving mechanism , " said co-author dr judith field , from the university of sydney .
" the role of humans in this process has yet to be established .
" more broadly , these findings suggest that the spread of modern humans to new regions did not necessarily result in unsustainable hunting and mass extinction of the native fauna . "
also , the researchers believe humans simply would not have had the hunting technologies to take out so many large creatures .
" there is not a single stone-spearpoint in australia until , at the very earliest , about 15,000 years ago - long after anyone thinks the megafauna went extinct , " co-author dr stephen wroe , from the university of sydney , told the bbc news website .
" you try taking out a two-to-three-tonne wombat with a pointy stick .
" i do n't doubt the first aboriginals did hunt megafauna but the argument that they did it with the efficiency required to effect near-instantaneous extinction is not , in my view , credible . "
small and big this analysis fits with the second paper , published by gilbert price , of queensland university of technology .
his view is that the colder , drier climate changed the types of animals that could survive in the region of australia he studied .
gilbert price studied fossils from queensland he found that the patterns of fossils in a creek bed in the darling downs area of south-east queensland suggested that other , smaller species also disappeared with the larger ones .
the shift in the fossils found in the 10m-deep section of creek bed mirrored the changes to the environment as woodland and scrubland gave way to grassland , he told memoirs of the queensland museum .
mr price said that many of the fossils found pre-dated human activity in the area , absolving humans from any involvement in their extinction .
" we 've done a little bit of radiocarbon dating on the deposits themselves and we know that the age of the deposits pre-dates the first humans on the darling downs by about 30-35,000 years , " he told the australian broadcasting corporation .
" we know that there 're no human or cultural artefacts in the deposits as well , and we know that all the cut marks on the bones are related to predation by some of the other species that lived on the darling downs , such as marsupial lions . "
dating doubts the possible role of humans in the demise of the megafauna is a hot topic in australian palaeontology .
the controversy was given extra impetus in 2001 when a paper published in the journal science reported new dating data for fossil-containing sediments from 28 sites across australia and papua new guinea .
the results suggested the great beasts had all gone by about 46,000 years ago - long before the dramatic climate changes brought on by the last glacial maximum , but late enough for the extinctions to have occurred in the presence of humans .
i would have been convinced if they had dated the bones directly by a reliable means - no easy task , i can assure you professor bert roberts , university of wollongong some took this as clear support for the blitzkrieg theory .
others still think events unfolded more slowly , and hold to the idea that humans caused catastrophic damage to animal habitats as they burned the landscape to drive game out into the open .
the cuddie springs site is crucial to the debate because it contains what appear to be some of the youngest fossils .
however , it is one of a number of sites which could have been disturbed , with previously buried bones being introduced into younger sediments .
if correct , this would mean that dates from such sites are unreliable .
the pnas team has attempted to resolve this issue by comparing the rare earth elements -lrb- ree -rrb- incorporated into bone fragments found at different levels within the cuddie springs sediments .
" when an animal dies and is buried , -lsb- these -rsb- elements in the local environment are adsorbed into its bones , forming a permanent ' fingerprint ' of the original burial locality .
fossils deposited at different times will have different concentrations of these elements , " said dr trueman .
the team believes this ree approach has proved that bones in each layer came from animals that lived and died together - that the sediments were not disturbed and the younger dates stand up .
but the lead author of the 2001 science paper , professor bert roberts , of the university of wollongong , told bbc news he still had doubts .
" the problem with using ree on such young deposits is the assumption -lrb- made by trueman et al -rrb- that ree are taken up soon after burial of the bones and that they then stay ' locked in ' .
" one of the papers they cite in support of this ' rapid uptake ' assumption in fact says that ree take 10,000 to 30,000 years to accumulate in bone .
" this length of time is trivial for bones that are millions of years old , but it matters if - as at cuddie springs - you 're looking at bones that are only a few tens of thousands of years old . "
in other words , ree information in older , eroded bones could get " overprinted " with younger dates if the specimens had been disturbed into more recent sediments .
he added : " i would have been convinced if they had dated the bones directly by a reliable means - no easy task , i can assure you .
" radiocarbon dating has already been tried twice , and failed on both occasions . "

it shows the number of challenges via the parking and traffic appeals service has risen faster than the 10 % rise in the number of tickets being issued .
nearly 44,300 drivers used the service in the year prior to november 2004 .
councils cancel about one in five tickets and two out of three fines are revoked by the adjudicator .
' worrying sign ' the increase in challenges means it can take a record four-and-a-half months to get a hearing .
deputy chair of the london assembly 's transport committee , lynne featherstone , said : " there is public support for parking enforcement , and the committee accepts the need for controls .
" but the fact that the number of appeals received by the chief parking adjudicator and his colleagues have gone up significantly is a worrying sign . "
the report found that many motorists felt it was unfair that they were fined the same amount for minor offences as major ones .
the transport committee recommended that london should have a two-tier fine system with penalties reflecting the seriousness of the offence .

it shows the number of challenges via the parking and traffic appeals service has risen faster than the 10 % rise in the number of tickets being issued .
nearly 44,300 drivers used the service in the year prior to november 2004 .
councils cancel about one in five tickets and two out of three fines are revoked by the adjudicator .
' worrying sign ' the increase in challenges means it can take a record four-and-a-half months to get a hearing .
deputy chair of the london assembly 's transport committee , lynne featherstone , said : " there is public support for parking enforcement , and the committee accepts the need for controls .
" but the fact that the number of appeals received by the chief parking adjudicator and his colleagues have gone up significantly is a worrying sign . "
the report found that many motorists felt it was unfair that they were fined the same amount for minor offences as major ones .
the transport committee recommended that london should have a two-tier fine system with penalties reflecting the seriousness of the offence .

he said it was " now time a decision was made " .
he added : " smoking is the single greatest preventable cause of premature death and avoidable illness and around 3,000 people die from smoking related diseases in northern ireland every year . "
we would encourage those employers who do n't already have a no-smoking policy in their workplace to implement one now and not to wait for it to be enforced dr brian gaffney hpa the hpa said research it carried out in february revealed an increase in support for smokefree workplaces .
the results suggested 74 % believed enclosed public places in northern ireland should be completely smokefree and 68 % said they would support a law to make all workplaces smokefree .
" bringing in smokefree workplaces would be one of the best ways to tackle smoking related illnesses and we would ask the government to stop dragging their heels and make a decision imminently , " said dr gaffney .
" there is growing demand for a smokefree northern ireland and already a number of businesses and organisations are operating smokefree policies .
" we would encourage those employers who do n't already have a no-smoking policy in their workplace to implement one now and not to wait for it to be enforced . "
a smoking ban in all northern ireland government departments came into effect in january .
the ban sees smoking facilities removed and staff forbidden to light up on site .
prisons are exempt from the ban .

the steam locomotive will be hauling trips between york and scarborough on tuesday , wednesday and thursday .
the museum bought the engine after a public appeal to save it going abroad .
nrm 's andrew scott said the best way to celebrate the anniversary was to have it in service " so people can experience the legend first hand . "
in 2004 , 16,000 people took rides on trains hauled by the doncaster-built engine which in 1934 became first locomotive to be officially timed in the uk at more than 100mph .
" when we bought flying scotsman on behalf of the nation , we promised to do our utmost to keep it on the mainline for the public to enjoy , " mr scott added .

doreen harley , from connah 's quay , said she has medical proof her daughter , lisa browne , 27 , who nursed in chester , died of long qt syndrome .
the inquest into the nurse 's death in 1998 recorded an open verdict and with an unascertainable cause of death .
mrs harley described the new evidence as " the end of the nightmare " .
she said : " it 's something we have always wanted .
the family could just not accept that lisa died for no apparent reason . "
mrs harley , of connah 's quay , flintshire , turned to experts in sweden for the technology to conduct genetic tests on post-mortem tissue taken from her daughter , who worked at the countess of chester hospital .
dna experts confirmed that lisa , who was found dead in bed with her arm resting on the alarm clock , had long qt syndrome , an hereditary electrical abnormality of the heart .
members of mrs harley 's family have since been found to have the condition which can cause loss of consciousness and sudden death .
as a result , said mrs harley , her surviving daughter , rachel , was fitted with a small internal defibrillator three years ago .
she said : " just weeks after she 'd had it done , her youngest son woke up screaming one night and rachel blacked out and the little machine kick started her heart .
" if she 'd not had that surgery she 'd not be here today .
" the defective gene is carried in the family .
the trigger for death is sudden noise . "
mrs harley , who also wants a uk-wide cardiac screening programme , said she had been in touch with the coroner over her findings and was " extremely optimistic " about having a new inquest .
she said : " i think it wo n't be long now before we get the inquest reopened and i feel very hopeful that the cause of death will be put down as long qt syndrome . "
long qt syndrome affects the length of time it takes the heart 's electrical system to recharge following a heartbeat - known as the qt interval .
people who have a long qt interval are vulnerable to a fast , abnormal heart rhythm .
when this occurs , no blood is pumped out of the heart and the brain becomes deprived of blood , causing loss of consciousness and sudden death .
those at risk can be treated either with drugs or with an implantable defibrillator which will shock the heart into action during cardiac arrest .

analysis by brian wheeler bbc news political reporter with channel 4 's big brother starting its sixth series this weekend , it is time once again to dust off one of the great political clichés of the age .
millions voted for big brother 5 winner nadia almost before the first desperate hopeful is evicted from the tv house , somebody somewhere - probably a politician or a journalist - will claim that more young people vote in reality television contests than take part in general elections .
but is there actually any truth in this claim ?
according to programme-makers endemol , there were 6,363,325 votes cast during the 2004 live final of big brother 5 .
the total number of votes cast in the most recent series of the bbc 's fame academy was 8,250,000 .
there were 27,128,130 votes cast in total the 2005 general election .
no contest there , then .
the house of commons beats the big brother house .
young people but what about 18 to 34-year olds - the target audience for reality television and the group most often portrayed as being disaffected with politics ?
the good news for the politicians is that the expected collapse in the vote among this age group at the 2005 general election appears not to have happened .
according to research by mori , 21 % of people who said they were " absolutely certain to vote " in the 2005 election were aged between 18 and 34 , an increase of about 1 % on 2001 .
the percentage of 25 to 34-year-olds who said they planned to vote went up by 3 % .
overall , that translates into 5,696,907 votes cast by 18 to 34-year-olds on 5 may .
if one assumes all the viewers of the big brother final are aged 18-34 , the programme was , on the face of it , slightly more popular than the general election among young voters .
multiple voting but these figures do not take into account multiple voting .
unlike in a general election , there is no bar to the number of votes viewers can cast in reality tv contests and programme makers try every trick in the book to keep the votes - and the cash - rolling in .
it is difficult not to conclude that there is popular support for e-voting , among a significant proportion of citizens deputy prime minister 's office figures on how many times people vote to keep their favourites in the house are hard to come by .
the programme makers and channel 4 say they do not compile such information .
but research by janet jones , a lecturer at aberystwyth university , suggests 54 % of viewers will vote once a week during a nine week run .
ms jones also found 10.5 % of big brother viewers voted between two and five times a week and 3 % said they voted more than five times a week .
' sorry individuals ' she told bbc news : " this means that over the course of the run , most respondents voted approximately ten times .
" a significant number voted up to 50 times and a minority voted from 50 to 100 times .
" and a few sorry individuals probably fuelled their addiction by voting well over 100 times . "
her research was based on 12,339 responses to a questionnaire on the big brother web site .
although it is far from conclusive , this research suggests the popularity of voting for big brother and other reality tv shows may be routinely overstated .
text messaging but this has not stopped the government and politicians in general from looking with envy at the mountain of votes piling up for big brother , i 'm a celebrity ... , fame academy and their like - and attempting to learn lessons from it .
one policy document on the office of the deputy prime minister 's website says : " a host of television and radio programmes such as itv1 's pop idol and channel 4 's big brother encourage viewer polls using telephone voting , sms -lrb- short message service -rrb- text messaging or internet voting .
" with such a proliferation of the method , it is difficult not to conclude that there is popular support for e-voting , among a significant proportion of citizens " .
labour 's election manifesto promised further measures to boost voter participation .
it is of course , possible to prove almost anything with careful manipulation of statistics .
but next time a politician appears on television claiming big brother is more popular than the general election among young voters , it is worth bearing in mind that they are almost certainly wrong .
