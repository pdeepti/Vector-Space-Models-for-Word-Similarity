today , the main streets of the baltic seaport were draped in the red and white of poland , with solidarity logos and huge posters recalling that the wave of strikes across the country in august 1980 - but especially the much-publicized gdansk shipyard strike - were the first brave steps towards ending communism in europe .
graffiti commissioned by the city authorities at one of the entrances to the port remind visitors and residents of the names of key players and events in the heady days of 1980 that led to the birth of the movement .
bildunterschrift : on one wall , an artist paid tribute to anna walentynowicz , the crane operator whose sacking sparked the shipyard strike on august 14 , 1980 .
on another , graffiti depict an underground printing press , where workers published illegal fliers against the communist regime .
spotlight on walesa on yet another , a street artist depicted a huge crowd gathered outside the lenin shipyard in gdansk during the august 1980 strike , as strike leader lech walesa signed an agreement with the communist bosses , giving victory to the workers .
on august 31 , walesa emerged from more than two weeks of talks between the strikers and shipyard bosses , and proclaimed to his fellow workers : " we have free , independent trade unions . "
solidarity , described by walesa as the greatest proletarian monopoly ever and the only movement able to take on communism , was born .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the solidarity logo " every time i come here , my heart does ten to the dozen , " shipyard worker maria wojciechowska told afp outside the gates of the sprawling industrial complex , now a mere skeleton of its glorious past , when poland built ships for the soviets .
the austere perimeter walls were bedecked with flowers on wednesday , a picture of the late pope john paul ii and an effigy of the black madonna of czestochowa .
evoking the pope walesa , a devout catholic , is said to have worn a lapel pin of the black madonna during the shipyard strike , and was close to and inspired by the late polish-born pope , whom he cited in a speech made to both houses of parliament on monday to kick off three days of events to mark solidarity 's creation .
" what changed the face of this land came from us , from our hearts and our souls , " walesa said , paraphrasing a speech pronounced in 1979 by john paul ii on his first pilgrimage to poland .
near the entrance to the shipyard , by a towering monument to polish workers killed by the communist government , some 20 heads of state and government will join dignitaries from around the world and solidarity leaders for a ceremony to mark the occasion . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland .

such flawed conclusions about homeopathy come from serious bias verging on vindictive prejudice on the researcher 's and lancet 's part . - harold b i think that homeopathy can be an immune stimulator , and it is in that capacity that i have experienced its usefulness - especially as a preventive against rhinovirus .
the question becomes whether the placebo effect is also an immune stimulator in the same way . - elizabeth krause , usa i 've suffered from severe seasonal allergies since childhood .
allopathic medicine was not able to help me - in fact , i developed several side effects from having to take antihistamines , sinus decongestors , etc .
finally i decided to give homeopathy a try .
it worked instantly .
it also began reducing the severity of my allergies from year to year .
i also give homeopathic remedies to my daughter and it works without giving her side effects from the over-the-counter allopathic cold meds .
this is a health system that treats people as individuals , so it would be difficult to replicate it in a lab under controlled conditions where people can not live in their own unique fashion .
does a lab study prove that god exists ?
i do n't really care what the study says , who paid for it and what the motive is .
the bottom line is : it works . - priya alldis thank you for your informative article on homeopathy .
i have n't used it intensively , preferring acupuncture and traditional chinese medicine instead . however , i have used arnica montana , which is a remedy for muscle bruising and soreness , with surprisingly good results . the bruises healed two to three times more quickly with either internal or external doses .
i 've also used a couple of the bach 's flower remedies with success .
these did n't work immediately for me -lrb- except for rescue remedy , which did -rrb- but were noticeably helpful .
for myself , i found that short-term they were mild improvements , but within three weeks or so to have pronounced success . - ana vargas , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : homeopathy no better than placebo homeopathic treatment is no more effective than a placebo , the dummy substance used in medical trials , according to a study appearing in the british medical weekly , " the lancet .

richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .

one of the striking things about the political mainstream parties , with the exception of the li n kspartei -lsb- the new left party -rsb- is , that they all agree the country badly needs thorough economic reform for germany to become more competitive and to be able to afford itself .
so the debate is not about whether reform is needed but of what kind and how radical .
and there is no doubt that germany has tremendous resources on which to build economic recovery - highly skilled and educated individuals , a good infrastructure , technological knowledge .
but there needs to be more private responsibility .
i would like to see greater development of a non-governmental civic society and a departure from this attitude that the state needs to take care of everything .

what does he make of the situation in pre-election germany ? dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .
of course unemployment is a problem , but there may be a bit of a tendency amongst germans to exaggerate the nature of their plight .
from an american standpoint , the social problems seem manageable .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y , to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
one of the striking things about the political mainstream parties , with the exception of the li n kspartei -lsb- the new left party -rsb- is , that they all agree the country badly needs thorough economic reform for germany to become more competitive and to be able to afford itself .
so the debate is not about whether reform is needed but of what kind and how radical .
and there is no doubt that germany has tremendous resources on which to build economic recovery - highly skilled and educated individuals , a good infrastructure , technological knowledge .
but there needs to be more private responsibility .
i would like to see greater development of a non-governmental civic society and a departure from this attitude that the state needs to take care of everything .
i think this is also one of the reasons for the situation of the education system .
the state can no longer finance free for all education .
german universities are still very good but do not compare anymore with the top institutions in the us and britain .

berlin is a wonderful city to live in .
a great deal of 20th century history happened here and now germany is struggling to make history of a different sort .
it 's fascinating to see how germany looks back on its history and forward at the same time .
germans have reflected on their history more than any other country with dark stains such as japan and the us .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
i miss a quality of flamboyance and outspokenness in germany .
political personalities are rather restrained , careful and sober .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2005 katrina could swamp german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil platforms have been shut down , raising concerns about supply germany 's economy minister has said he fears hurricane katrina , which has devastated the southern us coast , could lead to a further rise in oil prices and dampen already weak domestic spending in germany . minister wolfgang clement said a further rise in oil prices could have fatal consequences for german consumer spending , since a liter -lrb- 0.26 gallons -rrb- of high-octane gasoline in germany already costs more than 1.30 euros -lrb- $ 1.60 -rrb- , a record . " the situation on the oil market is very serious , " he said in berlin on wednesday .
the record oil price , now at over $ 70 per barrel , is " a real catastrophe for people , " he added . the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , georg ludwig braun , said the high oil prices are definitely a damper on germany 's domestic economy , since high prices for heating oil and other petroleum products would take money out of consumers ' wallets that they would normally spend for other purchases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weak consumer spending is often blamed by economists for the continuing weak performance of the german economy .
while exports continue to be robust , the spendthrift ways of german consumers have prevented the economy from taking flight . oil squeeze oil prices have jumped due to fears by traders that oil supplies could be squeezed in the wake of hurricane katrina , which caused several oil platforms in the gulf of mexico to close .
eight refineries in the us south were shut down and the production capacity of two others has been curtailed , meaning a loss of more than ten percent of us refinery capacity . bildunterschrift : the cheveron pascagoula refinery is shown flooded out by the storm surge caused by hurricane katrina in a pascagoula , miss . energy analysts warn it could be weeks before the real consequences of the storm can be assessed . opec said wednesday it would do its utmost to ensure the stability of the global oil market in the wake of the hurricane and would discuss the means at its summit in vienna on september 19-20 . evacuations continue rescuers scrambled buses , boats and helicopters wednesday to evacuate survivors of the catastrophe . new orleans mayor ray nagin said close to a million people had been evacuated from the city and surrounding areas before and after katrina pounded the gulf coast on monday , leaving hundreds feared dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this aerial photo shows the devastation caused by the high winds and heavy flooding in the greater new orleans area following hurricane katrina but he said " a couple hundred thousand " were still trapped with the lake spilling into the low-lying city after an effort to plug a breach in a major levee failed tuesday and pumps gave out . nagin told abc the flooding was not the only concern as he was also worried about bodies in the water .
" at some point in time , the dead bodies are going to start to create a serious disease issue . " surreal landscape the once-bustling southern jazz mecca offered an almost surreal watery landscape wednesday , with the eerie silence punctured only by the whirr of helicopters above and the occasional hum of a electric generator . people scrounging for food and cigarettes streets roamed ever-diminishing areas of dry land , including the famed french quarter .
shops were smashed by looters ; some were gutted by flames . bildunterschrift : new orleans residents walk through floodwaters that besiege the crescent city on tuesday , aug .
30 , 2005 . nagin said the waters flooding into the low-lying city " will rise to try and equal the water level of the lake , which is three feet -lrb- one meter -rrb- above sea level .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
healthy multiculturalism ?
is that what we are seeing in spain , holland , london and germany ?
a yet larger muslim population combined with dismal demographic numbers for european birth rates means visitors to europe will soon need to bring their arabic dictionaries .
this may offend liberal sensibilities but once a culture is swallowed up it will not return .
european culture has been the light of the world -lrb- although not lately -rrb- and it is worth protecting .
and i do n't mean from coca cola .
j.l. ronish we should not forget that a good portion of europe was under the yoke of the ottoman empire -lrb- i.e. , turkey -rrb- for many years .
the turks are of asian nature .
they are muslim and not christian european .
the muslims have been trying to gain control of the rest of europe for centuries .
h. regner unlucky marriage ?
i see the eu-turkish relationship like a couple .
turkey and the eu have been dating for a very long time with promises and commitments along the way .
they made plans to get engaged on oct .
3 .
the question is how will eu administrators tell turkey that its family -lrb- the public -rrb- is opposed to the marriage ?
ersan tasli if turkey is admitted to the eu , it will become the trojan horse of europe .
europe suffers from a catastrophic demographic problem , which has been underestimated by the various socialist-liberal governments .
turkey would be the second most populous eu country .
the greeks would suffer most .
we would disappear off the map .
manolis alifierakis , greece turkey is not part of europe and should not be admitted to the eu .
i realize the us is keen to see turkey join but of course they have their own agenda : the last thing the bush administration wants to see is a strong and independent europe .
an alliance 's strength is measured more by it 's unity than it 's size .
turkey would only weaken europe by it 's presence .
bob rehling , australia turkey does not belong in the eu because it does n't honor the principles of religious rights , human rights , minority rights , or democratic rule .
finally , it occupies and colonizes an eu member state - cyprus .
m.g. ikossi md , phd just one in favor ...
i am sure turkey belongs in the eu .
maybe not in the short run , but in the long run .
turkey will be a most important eu ally , not only in economic terms but military and other issues as well .
turkey joining the eu is a win-win situation .
they need each other .
izmir , turkey turkey 's recognition of cyprus turkey should not necessarily be required to recognize ' greek ' cyprus as the sole representative of the cypriot government .
this disregards any of the legitimate concerns leading to the 1974 invasion by turkey and also the recent affirmative reunification votes by the turkish cypriots that the greeks rejected .
once cyprus is reunited , then fine , recognition would become a prerequisite .
but not until then .
dave alexander , northern ireland .
if the eu is all about friendship and peace , how can it be that turkey does n't even recognize cyprus ?
is that friendship ?
george , cyprus compiled by dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives say no to turkey again in a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.08.2005 german gambling faces good odds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans spend billions of euros each year on gambling after a slow start , the gambling business in germany has begun to boom .
the growth will likely be accelerated by an expected liberalization in the sports betting market and the soccer world cup in 2006 . german pay-tv channel premiere has placed a huge bet on growth in the gambling sector - and the odds are looking good .
on august 1 , the company started a new channel , premiere win , which will exclusively broadcast betting sports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiere pay-tv station recently launched all-betting channel premiere win so far the young channel has shown horse races from around the world , but plans to branch out into other sports - soccer , handball , formula 1 racing - are in the works .
premiere win viewers can go online and place bets with premiere partner betandwin , a private bookmaker .
the move was a natural one for premiere , which broadcasts all the matches of the german bundesliga soccer league live and has the rights to live broadcasts of all 64 world cup matches in 2006 .
all aboard the gravy train " it was just a question of being the first one to get on the train , " said dietrich wüstehoff , head of pr at premiere win .
premiere is just one of many companies looking to take a seat at the betting banquet .
others include the german football league -lrb- dsl -rrb- , commercial tv station rtl and sports channel dsf .
" the german sports betting market is right on the edge of taking off because of the liberalization expected in the near future , " wüstehoff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gamblers can bet on many combinations - like who will get the first foul currently , state-run german bookmaker oddset has a monopoly on most sports betting , but that is being challenged in the courts , and a hearing is slated for nov .
8 .
when the decision comes early next year , it is widely expected to open up the betting market for competition - just in time for the world cup games .
changes afoot in addition to oddset , five other firms hold licenses to operate in germany , including betandwin , whose license dates back to the east german era .
in addition , numerous small bookmaking parlors , whose businesses are incorporated in other countries , have sprung up in germany in recent years .
mostly present in berlin , they operate in a sort of legal grey area .
if the market is opened up , these betting parlors can expect to become completely legitimate .
in that case , industry insiders say , germany 's betting scene will look more like england 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william hill betting office syndicate , london , great britain " we assume that in the long term , 10,000 betting offices will open up in germany , " the european betting association ’ s norbert teufelberger told the internet portal focus money .
the german association of bookmakers has said the market liberalization could create as many as 30,000 jobs .
on the down side , the competition from private betting agencies means a smaller share of the pie for the state-run betting companies , and thus less money flowing into government coffers .
big spenders , big business betting in germany is already big business .
gamblers spent three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- on sports bets alone in 2004 .
that could grow to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.1 billion -rrb- by 2010 , according to a study by munich-based mecn consulting group published in capital magazine .
the same study showed 30 billion euros was spent on other types of gambling , such as internet poker , official numbers picking -lrb- lottery games -rrb- and state-run casinos .
everyone agrees that the advent of internet gambling , which allows punters to place bets without having to get out of their bathrobes , has played a large role in the growth of the industry .
worldwide , surfers spent some 300 billion on internet gambling in 2004 , with all signs pointing to continued rapid growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a horse passes the sunrise during the morning trackwork at the nad al sheba horse race track in dubai stephan schröder , head of pr at the cologne-based sports research company sport & markt , notes that many gambling internet sites have been made so easy to use that " i hate to say it , but even an idiot can understand it . "
room for growth despite the large sums already being spent , a report put out by sport & markt shows there is still a lot of room for growth in the sector .
of the 65 million germans over age 14 , just seven million have placed sports bets , the study showed .
" that ’ s a lot of people , but it leaves a large untapped market , " schröder said .
surprisingly , the recent , much-reported scandal involving soccer referee robert hoyzer - he was involved in a croation gambling ring and fixed several games - has also given sports betting a boost .
" our numbers have leapt since the scandal hit the newspapers , " marcus meyer , marketing chief for betandwin , told the handelsblatt newspaper recently .
" the hoyzer case was a big topic on tv every day last spring .
in the reports , sports betting was explained , " he said .
" now it seems people want to try it for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formula one racing is a popular betting sport sport & markt 's schröder agrees that in terms of the gambling business , any news can be good news .
" in germany , people are relatively new to sports betting .
wherever they hear about it , it means they might want to try it out , " he said .
one other factor may stand behind the growth in germans ' willingness to plunk down a few euros for a chance at big money : the ailing economy .
" when people are n't doing well , there 's more of a tendency to try and win big , " said schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.08.2005 german gambling faces good odds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans spend billions of euros each year on gambling after a slow start , the gambling business in germany has begun to boom .
the growth will likely be accelerated by an expected liberalization in the sports betting market and the soccer world cup in 2006 . german pay-tv channel premiere has placed a huge bet on growth in the gambling sector - and the odds are looking good .
on august 1 , the company started a new channel , premiere win , which will exclusively broadcast betting sports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiere pay-tv station recently launched all-betting channel premiere win so far the young channel has shown horse races from around the world , but plans to branch out into other sports - soccer , handball , formula 1 racing - are in the works .
premiere win viewers can go online and place bets with premiere partner betandwin , a private bookmaker .
the move was a natural one for premiere , which broadcasts all the matches of the german bundesliga soccer league live and has the rights to live broadcasts of all 64 world cup matches in 2006 .
all aboard the gravy train " it was just a question of being the first one to get on the train , " said dietrich wüstehoff , head of pr at premiere win .
premiere is just one of many companies looking to take a seat at the betting banquet .
others include the german football league -lrb- dsl -rrb- , commercial tv station rtl and sports channel dsf .
" the german sports betting market is right on the edge of taking off because of the liberalization expected in the near future , " wüstehoff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gamblers can bet on many combinations - like who will get the first foul currently , state-run german bookmaker oddset has a monopoly on most sports betting , but that is being challenged in the courts , and a hearing is slated for nov .
8 .
when the decision comes early next year , it is widely expected to open up the betting market for competition - just in time for the world cup games .
changes afoot in addition to oddset , five other firms hold licenses to operate in germany , including betandwin , whose license dates back to the east german era .
in addition , numerous small bookmaking parlors , whose businesses are incorporated in other countries , have sprung up in germany in recent years .
mostly present in berlin , they operate in a sort of legal grey area .
if the market is opened up , these betting parlors can expect to become completely legitimate .
in that case , industry insiders say , germany 's betting scene will look more like england 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william hill betting office syndicate , london , great britain " we assume that in the long term , 10,000 betting offices will open up in germany , " the european betting association ’ s norbert teufelberger told the internet portal focus money .
the german association of bookmakers has said the market liberalization could create as many as 30,000 jobs .
on the down side , the competition from private betting agencies means a smaller share of the pie for the state-run betting companies , and thus less money flowing into government coffers .
big spenders , big business betting in germany is already big business .
gamblers spent three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- on sports bets alone in 2004 .
that could grow to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.1 billion -rrb- by 2010 , according to a study by munich-based mecn consulting group published in capital magazine .
the same study showed 30 billion euros was spent on other types of gambling , such as internet poker , official numbers picking -lrb- lottery games -rrb- and state-run casinos .
everyone agrees that the advent of internet gambling , which allows punters to place bets without having to get out of their bathrobes , has played a large role in the growth of the industry .
worldwide , surfers spent some 300 billion on internet gambling in 2004 , with all signs pointing to continued rapid growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a horse passes the sunrise during the morning trackwork at the nad al sheba horse race track in dubai stephan schröder , head of pr at the cologne-based sports research company sport & markt , notes that many gambling internet sites have been made so easy to use that " i hate to say it , but even an idiot can understand it . "
room for growth despite the large sums already being spent , a report put out by sport & markt shows there is still a lot of room for growth in the sector .
of the 65 million germans over age 14 , just seven million have placed sports bets , the study showed .
" that ’ s a lot of people , but it leaves a large untapped market , " schröder said .
surprisingly , the recent , much-reported scandal involving soccer referee robert hoyzer - he was involved in a croation gambling ring and fixed several games - has also given sports betting a boost .
" our numbers have leapt since the scandal hit the newspapers , " marcus meyer , marketing chief for betandwin , told the handelsblatt newspaper recently .
" the hoyzer case was a big topic on tv every day last spring .
in the reports , sports betting was explained , " he said .
" now it seems people want to try it for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formula one racing is a popular betting sport sport & markt 's schröder agrees that in terms of the gambling business , any news can be good news .
" in germany , people are relatively new to sports betting .
wherever they hear about it , it means they might want to try it out , " he said .
one other factor may stand behind the growth in germans ' willingness to plunk down a few euros for a chance at big money : the ailing economy .
" when people are n't doing well , there 's more of a tendency to try and win big , " said schröder .
" more people have less to lose , and they wish they could change their lives in an instant .

"
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .
just think of all the surveys , polls and programs on how depressed the nation is .

ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .
just think of all the surveys , polls and programs on how depressed the nation is .
it was interesting to see that the visit of the pope had an uplifting effect on the people when he addressed his vaterla n d in its own language .

" the situation on the oil market is very serious , " he said in berlin on wednesday .
the record oil price , now at over $ 70 per barrel , is " a real catastrophe for people , " he added . the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , georg ludwig braun , said the high oil prices are definitely a damper on germany 's domestic economy , since high prices for heating oil and other petroleum products would take money out of consumers ' wallets that they would normally spend for other purchases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weak consumer spending is often blamed by economists for the continuing weak performance of the german economy .
while exports continue to be robust , the spendthrift ways of german consumers have prevented the economy from taking flight . oil squeeze oil prices have jumped due to fears by traders that oil supplies could be squeezed in the wake of hurricane katrina , which caused several oil platforms in the gulf of mexico to close .
eight refineries in the us south were shut down and the production capacity of two others has been curtailed , meaning a loss of more than ten percent of us refinery capacity . bildunterschrift : the cheveron pascagoula refinery is shown flooded out by the storm surge caused by hurricane katrina in a pascagoula , miss . energy analysts warn it could be weeks before the real consequences of the storm can be assessed . opec said wednesday it would do its utmost to ensure the stability of the global oil market in the wake of the hurricane and would discuss the means at its summit in vienna on september 19-20 . evacuations continue rescuers scrambled buses , boats and helicopters wednesday to evacuate survivors of the catastrophe . new orleans mayor ray nagin said close to a million people had been evacuated from the city and surrounding areas before and after katrina pounded the gulf coast on monday , leaving hundreds feared dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this aerial photo shows the devastation caused by the high winds and heavy flooding in the greater new orleans area following hurricane katrina but he said " a couple hundred thousand " were still trapped with the lake spilling into the low-lying city after an effort to plug a breach in a major levee failed tuesday and pumps gave out . nagin told abc the flooding was not the only concern as he was also worried about bodies in the water .
" at some point in time , the dead bodies are going to start to create a serious disease issue . " surreal landscape the once-bustling southern jazz mecca offered an almost surreal watery landscape wednesday , with the eerie silence punctured only by the whirr of helicopters above and the occasional hum of a electric generator . people scrounging for food and cigarettes streets roamed ever-diminishing areas of dry land , including the famed french quarter .
shops were smashed by looters ; some were gutted by flames . bildunterschrift : new orleans residents walk through floodwaters that besiege the crescent city on tuesday , aug .
30 , 2005 . nagin said the waters flooding into the low-lying city " will rise to try and equal the water level of the lake , which is three feet -lrb- one meter -rrb- above sea level . " that 's significant , because on st. charles avenue , one of our most famous avenues , it is six feet below sea level in elevation .
there will be nine feet in that area , and probably 20 feet in other areas of the city , " he said . nagin said it would be 12 to 16 weeks before residents could return to the city , an assessment echoed by blanco .
" we do n't know the integrity of the buildings , " she said .
" but it is going to be weeks , perhaps months . " " it is a logistical nightmare for us to just bring water and food supplies in .
the stores ca n't function , you know .
it is a miserable situation , " the governor said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?

nearly 30 percent of the companies had already moved part of their operations overseas or had plans to do so , the study showed .
for the most part , the companies that planned to shift research and development capacity abroad were those that had moved production there earlier .
businesses cited lower wages abroad , proximity to clients and demands of the marketplace as their reasons for the increased overseas presence .

" the situation on the oil market is very serious , " he said in berlin on wednesday .
the record oil price , now at over $ 70 per barrel , is " a real catastrophe for people , " he added . the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , georg ludwig braun , said the high oil prices are definitely a damper on germany 's domestic economy , since high prices for heating oil and other petroleum products would take money out of consumers ' wallets that they would normally spend for other purchases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weak consumer spending is often blamed by economists for the continuing weak performance of the german economy .
while exports continue to be robust , the spendthrift ways of german consumers have prevented the economy from taking flight . oil squeeze oil prices have jumped due to fears by traders that oil supplies could be squeezed in the wake of hurricane katrina , which caused several oil platforms in the gulf of mexico to close .
eight refineries in the us south were shut down and the production capacity of two others has been curtailed , meaning a loss of more than ten percent of us refinery capacity . bildunterschrift : the cheveron pascagoula refinery is shown flooded out by the storm surge caused by hurricane katrina in a pascagoula , miss . energy analysts warn it could be weeks before the real consequences of the storm can be assessed . opec said wednesday it would do its utmost to ensure the stability of the global oil market in the wake of the hurricane and would discuss the means at its summit in vienna on september 19-20 . evacuations continue rescuers scrambled buses , boats and helicopters wednesday to evacuate survivors of the catastrophe . new orleans mayor ray nagin said close to a million people had been evacuated from the city and surrounding areas before and after katrina pounded the gulf coast on monday , leaving hundreds feared dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this aerial photo shows the devastation caused by the high winds and heavy flooding in the greater new orleans area following hurricane katrina but he said " a couple hundred thousand " were still trapped with the lake spilling into the low-lying city after an effort to plug a breach in a major levee failed tuesday and pumps gave out . nagin told abc the flooding was not the only concern as he was also worried about bodies in the water .
" at some point in time , the dead bodies are going to start to create a serious disease issue . " surreal landscape the once-bustling southern jazz mecca offered an almost surreal watery landscape wednesday , with the eerie silence punctured only by the whirr of helicopters above and the occasional hum of a electric generator . people scrounging for food and cigarettes streets roamed ever-diminishing areas of dry land , including the famed french quarter .
shops were smashed by looters ; some were gutted by flames . bildunterschrift : new orleans residents walk through floodwaters that besiege the crescent city on tuesday , aug .
30 , 2005 . nagin said the waters flooding into the low-lying city " will rise to try and equal the water level of the lake , which is three feet -lrb- one meter -rrb- above sea level . " that 's significant , because on st. charles avenue , one of our most famous avenues , it is six feet below sea level in elevation .
there will be nine feet in that area , and probably 20 feet in other areas of the city , " he said . nagin said it would be 12 to 16 weeks before residents could return to the city , an assessment echoed by blanco .
" we do n't know the integrity of the buildings , " she said .
" but it is going to be weeks , perhaps months . " " it is a logistical nightmare for us to just bring water and food supplies in .
the stores ca n't function , you know .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . after an iatrogenic waterfall caused by the prescribing of two wrong meds together which hospitalized my son , i went to a homeopath -lrb- german born ! -rrb- .
after a 3 hour intake interview , he said the symptoms would be resolved by chelation -lrb- natural food substances -rrb- and homeopathic remedies .
and that it would take about four to five years .
just as he said , my son is well after a lot of hard work on all of our parts .
the illness was ocd -lrb- obsessive-compulsive disorder -rrb- .
tell the amazing randi -lrb- a us illusionist who offered $ 1 million for proof that homeopathy works -rrb- to top that and keep his money where his mouth is . - nora g i have used homeopathy for my child who is five years of age .
he had delayed speech .
he had not spoken till he was three year of age and i was told that homeopathy had a medicine that would make him talk .
today he talks so much that i have to ask him to keep quiet . - niraja after the recent article , lancet 's editorial conclusions about homeopathy defy logic .
are they saying that if someone selected 100 studies that showed no outcome of various allopathic medications that that proves that the whole of regular medicine does n't work ?
it would be easy to find these studies !
such flawed conclusions about homeopathy come from serious bias verging on vindictive prejudice on the researcher 's and lancet 's part . - harold b i think that homeopathy can be an immune stimulator , and it is in that capacity that i have experienced its usefulness - especially as a preventive against rhinovirus .
the question becomes whether the placebo effect is also an immune stimulator in the same way . - elizabeth krause , usa i 've suffered from severe seasonal allergies since childhood .
allopathic medicine was not able to help me - in fact , i developed several side effects from having to take antihistamines , sinus decongestors , etc .
finally i decided to give homeopathy a try .
it worked instantly .
it also began reducing the severity of my allergies from year to year .
i also give homeopathic remedies to my daughter and it works without giving her side effects from the over-the-counter allopathic cold meds .
this is a health system that treats people as individuals , so it would be difficult to replicate it in a lab under controlled conditions where people can not live in their own unique fashion .
does a lab study prove that god exists ?
i do n't really care what the study says , who paid for it and what the motive is .
the bottom line is : it works . - priya alldis thank you for your informative article on homeopathy .
i have n't used it intensively , preferring acupuncture and traditional chinese medicine instead . however , i have used arnica montana , which is a remedy for muscle bruising and soreness , with surprisingly good results . the bruises healed two to three times more quickly with either internal or external doses .
i 've also used a couple of the bach 's flower remedies with success .
these did n't work immediately for me -lrb- except for rescue remedy , which did -rrb- but were noticeably helpful .
for myself , i found that short-term they were mild improvements , but within three weeks or so to have pronounced success . - ana vargas , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : homeopathy no better than placebo homeopathic treatment is no more effective than a placebo , the dummy substance used in medical trials , according to a study appearing in the british medical weekly , " the lancet .

i also give homeopathic remedies to my daughter and it works without giving her side effects from the over-the-counter allopathic cold meds .
this is a health system that treats people as individuals , so it would be difficult to replicate it in a lab under controlled conditions where people can not live in their own unique fashion .

a new study shows the german trend toward shifting jobs overseas is growing in the r & d sector - but business advocates try to look at the bright side . the poll by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- surveyed 4,400 internationally active companies , including small and medium-sized businesses .
nearly 30 percent of the companies had already moved part of their operations overseas or had plans to do so , the study showed .
for the most part , the companies that planned to shift research and development capacity abroad were those that had moved production there earlier .
businesses cited lower wages abroad , proximity to clients and demands of the marketplace as their reasons for the increased overseas presence .

while the increase in jobs abroad did help keep the german economy afloat , the situation could be much better for germany , said dihk head ludwig-georg braun .
staying positive " the dynamics of foreign economies could have a more positive effect on german jobs if many companies would not opt to move their production and research and development overseas , " braun said .
in an effort to see the positive side of the results , braun noted that the study clearly showed international activity helped keep sales and personnel levels afloat at home .

the more companies moved production abroad , however , the more they would consider moving research and development jobs as well , braun warned .

a new study shows the german trend toward shifting jobs overseas is growing in the r & d sector - but business advocates try to look at the bright side . the poll by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- surveyed 4,400 internationally active companies , including small and medium-sized businesses .
nearly 30 percent of the companies had already moved part of their operations overseas or had plans to do so , the study showed .
for the most part , the companies that planned to shift research and development capacity abroad were those that had moved production there earlier .
businesses cited lower wages abroad , proximity to clients and demands of the marketplace as their reasons for the increased overseas presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens makes cell phones in brazil only 3 percent of those who had moved production or research facilities abroad would like to bring them back to germany , the study showed .
while the increase in jobs abroad did help keep the german economy afloat , the situation could be much better for germany , said dihk head ludwig-georg braun .
staying positive " the dynamics of foreign economies could have a more positive effect on german jobs if many companies would not opt to move their production and research and development overseas , " braun said .
in an effort to see the positive side of the results , braun noted that the study clearly showed international activity helped keep sales and personnel levels afloat at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish launderers clean linens for berlin hotels according to the report , 55 percent of the companies polled had improved sales as a result of their move .
some 37 percent of respondents said that since moving some activities overseas , they had been able to expand within germany .
another 22 percent said they had laid off personnel .
the more companies moved production abroad , however , the more they would consider moving research and development jobs as well , braun warned .
companies most frequently moved production to new eu member states and to asia .
hopes for future braun said he hoped a new government would help boost the country in terms of innovation , development and research .
and he hoped that foreign investors would begin to see germany as an attractive location for their businesses . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?

it underlines yet again there is no alternative to global climate protection . damages of about $ 30 billion , a large city almost completely evacuated and 70 percent of it under water - hurricane katrina has proved that water and storms are still the worst natural catastrophes .
the southern part of the us is aware of that and has been for a long time .
tropical storms emerging from the warm sea are n't a rarity and the warmer it is , the stronger they are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of moss point , miss . , make their way to safety .
not insignificantly , humans have contributed to this new fury unleashed by global climate change - more concretely , by burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal which in turn release carbon dioxide .
listening to the experts not fashionable climate experts have been saying it for years : it 's not the number of hurricanes that 's increasing but rather their intensity .
but the experts were first ignored by politicians and then mildly snickered at .
at present , their theories are being angrily rejected , even though many of their scenarios are becoming reality , simply because their statements are uncomfortable .
that 's because the experts also explain what mankind can and must do in order to stop the greenhouse effect - in order to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , one needs different energy sources such as wind and sun and more gas instead of coal , more fuel-efficient cars and more energy savings .
all that was popular at the beginning of the 1990s when the world 's nations met in rio de janeiro and agreed on a global environment policy .
the euphoria was heady given that it came about so soon after the fall of the iron curtain .
many things , if not all , seemed possible - even a solution to climate problems .
dashed hopes but much has happened since .
the new economy collapsed , the horrific vision of international terrorism took shape , the economies of leading industrial nations lurched from crisis to crisis and the preservation of the environment slipped from world attention .
the us , which initially helped shape the new global environment policy , shrank back from once concrete steps had to be taken .
bildunterschrift : palm trees are bent from the force of hurricane katrina in an area hit by hurricane ivan last september in the grande lagoon area of pensacola , florida the talks on the kyoto protocol which began on a hopeful note proved to be laborious and tough .
the results are pitiful when compared to the demands .
the treaty , which was sealed in february 2005 , allows worldwide emission levels to stagnate , at the very best .
talk of reducing them has all but evaporated and the us is simply not playing along any more .
the americans love their gas-guzzling pickup trucks and their gigantic refrigerators .
the average us citizen consumes twice the amount of energy than the average european , who in turn consumes much more than an african .
soon , the upcoming asian countries of india and china will ensure that energy consumption will rise drastically .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.08.2005 german gambling faces good odds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans spend billions of euros each year on gambling after a slow start , the gambling business in germany has begun to boom .
the growth will likely be accelerated by an expected liberalization in the sports betting market and the soccer world cup in 2006 . german pay-tv channel premiere has placed a huge bet on growth in the gambling sector - and the odds are looking good .
on august 1 , the company started a new channel , premiere win , which will exclusively broadcast betting sports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiere pay-tv station recently launched all-betting channel premiere win so far the young channel has shown horse races from around the world , but plans to branch out into other sports - soccer , handball , formula 1 racing - are in the works .
premiere win viewers can go online and place bets with premiere partner betandwin , a private bookmaker .
the move was a natural one for premiere , which broadcasts all the matches of the german bundesliga soccer league live and has the rights to live broadcasts of all 64 world cup matches in 2006 .
all aboard the gravy train " it was just a question of being the first one to get on the train , " said dietrich wüstehoff , head of pr at premiere win .
premiere is just one of many companies looking to take a seat at the betting banquet .
others include the german football league -lrb- dsl -rrb- , commercial tv station rtl and sports channel dsf .
" the german sports betting market is right on the edge of taking off because of the liberalization expected in the near future , " wüstehoff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gamblers can bet on many combinations - like who will get the first foul currently , state-run german bookmaker oddset has a monopoly on most sports betting , but that is being challenged in the courts , and a hearing is slated for nov .
8 .
when the decision comes early next year , it is widely expected to open up the betting market for competition - just in time for the world cup games .
changes afoot in addition to oddset , five other firms hold licenses to operate in germany , including betandwin , whose license dates back to the east german era .
in addition , numerous small bookmaking parlors , whose businesses are incorporated in other countries , have sprung up in germany in recent years .
mostly present in berlin , they operate in a sort of legal grey area .
if the market is opened up , these betting parlors can expect to become completely legitimate .
in that case , industry insiders say , germany 's betting scene will look more like england 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william hill betting office syndicate , london , great britain " we assume that in the long term , 10,000 betting offices will open up in germany , " the european betting association ’ s norbert teufelberger told the internet portal focus money .
the german association of bookmakers has said the market liberalization could create as many as 30,000 jobs .
on the down side , the competition from private betting agencies means a smaller share of the pie for the state-run betting companies , and thus less money flowing into government coffers .
big spenders , big business betting in germany is already big business .
gamblers spent three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- on sports bets alone in 2004 .
that could grow to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.1 billion -rrb- by 2010 , according to a study by munich-based mecn consulting group published in capital magazine .
the same study showed 30 billion euros was spent on other types of gambling , such as internet poker , official numbers picking -lrb- lottery games -rrb- and state-run casinos .
everyone agrees that the advent of internet gambling , which allows punters to place bets without having to get out of their bathrobes , has played a large role in the growth of the industry .
worldwide , surfers spent some 300 billion on internet gambling in 2004 , with all signs pointing to continued rapid growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a horse passes the sunrise during the morning trackwork at the nad al sheba horse race track in dubai stephan schröder , head of pr at the cologne-based sports research company sport & markt , notes that many gambling internet sites have been made so easy to use that " i hate to say it , but even an idiot can understand it . "
room for growth despite the large sums already being spent , a report put out by sport & markt shows there is still a lot of room for growth in the sector .
of the 65 million germans over age 14 , just seven million have placed sports bets , the study showed .
" that ’ s a lot of people , but it leaves a large untapped market , " schröder said .
surprisingly , the recent , much-reported scandal involving soccer referee robert hoyzer - he was involved in a croation gambling ring and fixed several games - has also given sports betting a boost .
" our numbers have leapt since the scandal hit the newspapers , " marcus meyer , marketing chief for betandwin , told the handelsblatt newspaper recently .
" the hoyzer case was a big topic on tv every day last spring .
in the reports , sports betting was explained , " he said .
" now it seems people want to try it for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formula one racing is a popular betting sport sport & markt 's schröder agrees that in terms of the gambling business , any news can be good news .
" in germany , people are relatively new to sports betting .
wherever they hear about it , it means they might want to try it out , " he said .
one other factor may stand behind the growth in germans ' willingness to plunk down a few euros for a chance at big money : the ailing economy .
" when people are n't doing well , there 's more of a tendency to try and win big , " said schröder .

what does he make of the situation in pre-election germany ? dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .
of course unemployment is a problem , but there may be a bit of a tendency amongst germans to exaggerate the nature of their plight .
from an american standpoint , the social problems seem manageable .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y , to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
one of the striking things about the political mainstream parties , with the exception of the li n kspartei -lsb- the new left party -rsb- is , that they all agree the country badly needs thorough economic reform for germany to become more competitive and to be able to afford itself .
so the debate is not about whether reform is needed but of what kind and how radical .
and there is no doubt that germany has tremendous resources on which to build economic recovery - highly skilled and educated individuals , a good infrastructure , technological knowledge .
but there needs to be more private responsibility .
i would like to see greater development of a non-governmental civic society and a departure from this attitude that the state needs to take care of everything .
i think this is also one of the reasons for the situation of the education system .
the state can no longer finance free for all education .
german universities are still very good but do not compare anymore with the top institutions in the us and britain .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't have an answer to that .
what do you like about germa n y ?
i enjoy being here .
berlin is a wonderful city to live in .
a great deal of 20th century history happened here and now germany is struggling to make history of a different sort .
it 's fascinating to see how germany looks back on its history and forward at the same time .
germans have reflected on their history more than any other country with dark stains such as japan and the us .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
i miss a quality of flamboyance and outspokenness in germany .
political personalities are rather restrained , careful and sober .
it 's a country that lives cautiously . ranty islam interviewed richard bernstein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .

what does he make of the situation in pre-election germany ? dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .
of course unemployment is a problem , but there may be a bit of a tendency amongst germans to exaggerate the nature of their plight .
from an american standpoint , the social problems seem manageable .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y , to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
one of the striking things about the political mainstream parties , with the exception of the li n kspartei -lsb- the new left party -rsb- is , that they all agree the country badly needs thorough economic reform for germany to become more competitive and to be able to afford itself .
so the debate is not about whether reform is needed but of what kind and how radical .
and there is no doubt that germany has tremendous resources on which to build economic recovery - highly skilled and educated individuals , a good infrastructure , technological knowledge .
but there needs to be more private responsibility .
i would like to see greater development of a non-governmental civic society and a departure from this attitude that the state needs to take care of everything .
i think this is also one of the reasons for the situation of the education system .
the state can no longer finance free for all education .

the growth will likely be accelerated by an expected liberalization in the sports betting market and the soccer world cup in 2006 . german pay-tv channel premiere has placed a huge bet on growth in the gambling sector - and the odds are looking good .
on august 1 , the company started a new channel , premiere win , which will exclusively broadcast betting sports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiere pay-tv station recently launched all-betting channel premiere win so far the young channel has shown horse races from around the world , but plans to branch out into other sports - soccer , handball , formula 1 racing - are in the works .
premiere win viewers can go online and place bets with premiere partner betandwin , a private bookmaker .
the move was a natural one for premiere , which broadcasts all the matches of the german bundesliga soccer league live and has the rights to live broadcasts of all 64 world cup matches in 2006 .
all aboard the gravy train " it was just a question of being the first one to get on the train , " said dietrich wüstehoff , head of pr at premiere win .
premiere is just one of many companies looking to take a seat at the betting banquet .
others include the german football league -lrb- dsl -rrb- , commercial tv station rtl and sports channel dsf .
" the german sports betting market is right on the edge of taking off because of the liberalization expected in the near future , " wüstehoff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gamblers can bet on many combinations - like who will get the first foul currently , state-run german bookmaker oddset has a monopoly on most sports betting , but that is being challenged in the courts , and a hearing is slated for nov .
8 .
when the decision comes early next year , it is widely expected to open up the betting market for competition - just in time for the world cup games .
changes afoot in addition to oddset , five other firms hold licenses to operate in germany , including betandwin , whose license dates back to the east german era .
in addition , numerous small bookmaking parlors , whose businesses are incorporated in other countries , have sprung up in germany in recent years .
mostly present in berlin , they operate in a sort of legal grey area .
if the market is opened up , these betting parlors can expect to become completely legitimate .
in that case , industry insiders say , germany 's betting scene will look more like england 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william hill betting office syndicate , london , great britain " we assume that in the long term , 10,000 betting offices will open up in germany , " the european betting association ’ s norbert teufelberger told the internet portal focus money .
the german association of bookmakers has said the market liberalization could create as many as 30,000 jobs .
on the down side , the competition from private betting agencies means a smaller share of the pie for the state-run betting companies , and thus less money flowing into government coffers .
big spenders , big business betting in germany is already big business .
gamblers spent three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- on sports bets alone in 2004 .
that could grow to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.1 billion -rrb- by 2010 , according to a study by munich-based mecn consulting group published in capital magazine .
the same study showed 30 billion euros was spent on other types of gambling , such as internet poker , official numbers picking -lrb- lottery games -rrb- and state-run casinos .
everyone agrees that the advent of internet gambling , which allows punters to place bets without having to get out of their bathrobes , has played a large role in the growth of the industry .
worldwide , surfers spent some 300 billion on internet gambling in 2004 , with all signs pointing to continued rapid growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a horse passes the sunrise during the morning trackwork at the nad al sheba horse race track in dubai stephan schröder , head of pr at the cologne-based sports research company sport & markt , notes that many gambling internet sites have been made so easy to use that " i hate to say it , but even an idiot can understand it . "
room for growth despite the large sums already being spent , a report put out by sport & markt shows there is still a lot of room for growth in the sector .
of the 65 million germans over age 14 , just seven million have placed sports bets , the study showed .
" that ’ s a lot of people , but it leaves a large untapped market , " schröder said .
surprisingly , the recent , much-reported scandal involving soccer referee robert hoyzer - he was involved in a croation gambling ring and fixed several games - has also given sports betting a boost .
" our numbers have leapt since the scandal hit the newspapers , " marcus meyer , marketing chief for betandwin , told the handelsblatt newspaper recently .
" the hoyzer case was a big topic on tv every day last spring .
in the reports , sports betting was explained , " he said .
" now it seems people want to try it for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formula one racing is a popular betting sport sport & markt 's schröder agrees that in terms of the gambling business , any news can be good news .
" in germany , people are relatively new to sports betting .
wherever they hear about it , it means they might want to try it out , " he said .
one other factor may stand behind the growth in germans ' willingness to plunk down a few euros for a chance at big money : the ailing economy .
" when people are n't doing well , there 's more of a tendency to try and win big , " said schröder .

if the market is opened up , these betting parlors can expect to become completely legitimate .
in that case , industry insiders say , germany 's betting scene will look more like england 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william hill betting office syndicate , london , great britain " we assume that in the long term , 10,000 betting offices will open up in germany , " the european betting association ’ s norbert teufelberger told the internet portal focus money .
the german association of bookmakers has said the market liberalization could create as many as 30,000 jobs .
on the down side , the competition from private betting agencies means a smaller share of the pie for the state-run betting companies , and thus less money flowing into government coffers .
big spenders , big business betting in germany is already big business .
gamblers spent three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- on sports bets alone in 2004 .
that could grow to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.1 billion -rrb- by 2010 , according to a study by munich-based mecn consulting group published in capital magazine .
the same study showed 30 billion euros was spent on other types of gambling , such as internet poker , official numbers picking -lrb- lottery games -rrb- and state-run casinos .
everyone agrees that the advent of internet gambling , which allows punters to place bets without having to get out of their bathrobes , has played a large role in the growth of the industry .
worldwide , surfers spent some 300 billion on internet gambling in 2004 , with all signs pointing to continued rapid growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a horse passes the sunrise during the morning trackwork at the nad al sheba horse race track in dubai stephan schröder , head of pr at the cologne-based sports research company sport & markt , notes that many gambling internet sites have been made so easy to use that " i hate to say it , but even an idiot can understand it . "
room for growth despite the large sums already being spent , a report put out by sport & markt shows there is still a lot of room for growth in the sector .
of the 65 million germans over age 14 , just seven million have placed sports bets , the study showed .
" that ’ s a lot of people , but it leaves a large untapped market , " schröder said .
surprisingly , the recent , much-reported scandal involving soccer referee robert hoyzer - he was involved in a croation gambling ring and fixed several games - has also given sports betting a boost .
" our numbers have leapt since the scandal hit the newspapers , " marcus meyer , marketing chief for betandwin , told the handelsblatt newspaper recently .
" the hoyzer case was a big topic on tv every day last spring .
in the reports , sports betting was explained , " he said .
" now it seems people want to try it for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formula one racing is a popular betting sport sport & markt 's schröder agrees that in terms of the gambling business , any news can be good news .
" in germany , people are relatively new to sports betting .
wherever they hear about it , it means they might want to try it out , " he said .
one other factor may stand behind the growth in germans ' willingness to plunk down a few euros for a chance at big money : the ailing economy .
" when people are n't doing well , there 's more of a tendency to try and win big , " said schröder .
" more people have less to lose , and they wish they could change their lives in an instant .

"
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .
just think of all the surveys , polls and programs on how depressed the nation is .
it was interesting to see that the visit of the pope had an uplifting effect on the people when he addressed his vaterla n d in its own language .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the foreign media 's take on germany ray furlong aktham suliman luke harding yan li election 2005 -pipe- 31.08.2005 derek scally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scally : germans seem beset by " katastrophalismus " since 2000 derek scally has reported from berlin for the " irish times . "
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .
just think of all the surveys , polls and programs on how depressed the nation is .
it was interesting to see that the visit of the pope had an uplifting effect on the people when he addressed his vaterla n d in its own language .
if anyone can break the gloomy mood in germany it seems it is the pope . ranty islam interviewed derek scally send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .
the comments have raised the ire of social groups .
-lrb- sep .
18 , 2004 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .
-lrb- aug .

today , the main streets of the baltic seaport were draped in the red and white of poland , with solidarity logos and huge posters recalling that the wave of strikes across the country in august 1980 - but especially the much-publicized gdansk shipyard strike - were the first brave steps towards ending communism in europe .

evoking the pope walesa , a devout catholic , is said to have worn a lapel pin of the black madonna during the shipyard strike , and was close to and inspired by the late polish-born pope , whom he cited in a speech made to both houses of parliament on monday to kick off three days of events to mark solidarity 's creation .
" what changed the face of this land came from us , from our hearts and our souls , " walesa said , paraphrasing a speech pronounced in 1979 by john paul ii on his first pilgrimage to poland .

" the situation on the oil market is very serious , " he said in berlin on wednesday .
the record oil price , now at over $ 70 per barrel , is " a real catastrophe for people , " he added . the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , georg ludwig braun , said the high oil prices are definitely a damper on germany 's domestic economy , since high prices for heating oil and other petroleum products would take money out of consumers ' wallets that they would normally spend for other purchases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weak consumer spending is often blamed by economists for the continuing weak performance of the german economy .
while exports continue to be robust , the spendthrift ways of german consumers have prevented the economy from taking flight . oil squeeze oil prices have jumped due to fears by traders that oil supplies could be squeezed in the wake of hurricane katrina , which caused several oil platforms in the gulf of mexico to close .
eight refineries in the us south were shut down and the production capacity of two others has been curtailed , meaning a loss of more than ten percent of us refinery capacity . bildunterschrift : the cheveron pascagoula refinery is shown flooded out by the storm surge caused by hurricane katrina in a pascagoula , miss . energy analysts warn it could be weeks before the real consequences of the storm can be assessed . opec said wednesday it would do its utmost to ensure the stability of the global oil market in the wake of the hurricane and would discuss the means at its summit in vienna on september 19-20 . evacuations continue rescuers scrambled buses , boats and helicopters wednesday to evacuate survivors of the catastrophe . new orleans mayor ray nagin said close to a million people had been evacuated from the city and surrounding areas before and after katrina pounded the gulf coast on monday , leaving hundreds feared dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this aerial photo shows the devastation caused by the high winds and heavy flooding in the greater new orleans area following hurricane katrina but he said " a couple hundred thousand " were still trapped with the lake spilling into the low-lying city after an effort to plug a breach in a major levee failed tuesday and pumps gave out . nagin told abc the flooding was not the only concern as he was also worried about bodies in the water .
" at some point in time , the dead bodies are going to start to create a serious disease issue . " surreal landscape the once-bustling southern jazz mecca offered an almost surreal watery landscape wednesday , with the eerie silence punctured only by the whirr of helicopters above and the occasional hum of a electric generator . people scrounging for food and cigarettes streets roamed ever-diminishing areas of dry land , including the famed french quarter .
shops were smashed by looters ; some were gutted by flames . bildunterschrift : new orleans residents walk through floodwaters that besiege the crescent city on tuesday , aug .
30 , 2005 . nagin said the waters flooding into the low-lying city " will rise to try and equal the water level of the lake , which is three feet -lrb- one meter -rrb- above sea level . " that 's significant , because on st. charles avenue , one of our most famous avenues , it is six feet below sea level in elevation .
there will be nine feet in that area , and probably 20 feet in other areas of the city , " he said . nagin said it would be 12 to 16 weeks before residents could return to the city , an assessment echoed by blanco .
" we do n't know the integrity of the buildings , " she said .
" but it is going to be weeks , perhaps months . " " it is a logistical nightmare for us to just bring water and food supplies in .
the stores ca n't function , you know .
it is a miserable situation , " the governor said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany exploiting katrina ?

18 general election , the number of people looking for work in germany declined in august , official data showed wednesday , a development the government hailed as the long-awaited turnaround on the country 's troubled labor market .
according to the latest calculations by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless total declined by 44,000 to 4.728 million in raw or unadjusted terms this month , bringing the jobless rate down to 11.4 percent from 11.5 percent .
the improvement reversed - at least partially - the increase in unemployment seen the previous month .
in july , the jobless queues had lengthened as students and school-leavers signed on at the start of the summer holidays .
the fall in unemployment , however modest , will come as a welcome piece of news for the current government under chancellor gerhard schröder , who is facing possible defeat in the sept .

and that it would take about four to five years .

today he talks so much that i have to ask him to keep quiet . - niraja after the recent article , lancet 's editorial conclusions about homeopathy defy logic .
are they saying that if someone selected 100 studies that showed no outcome of various allopathic medications that that proves that the whole of regular medicine does n't work ?

the question becomes whether the placebo effect is also an immune stimulator in the same way . - elizabeth krause , usa i 've suffered from severe seasonal allergies since childhood .
allopathic medicine was not able to help me - in fact , i developed several side effects from having to take antihistamines , sinus decongestors , etc .
finally i decided to give homeopathy a try .
it worked instantly .
it also began reducing the severity of my allergies from year to year .
i also give homeopathic remedies to my daughter and it works without giving her side effects from the over-the-counter allopathic cold meds .
this is a health system that treats people as individuals , so it would be difficult to replicate it in a lab under controlled conditions where people can not live in their own unique fashion .

"
chancellor gerhard schröder is at his best when his back is against the wall .
at his spd party congress on wednesday , he tried passing on some of that energy on to his party in the waning weeks of the campaign . gravel voiced and employing the entire arsenal of his vaunted communicative skills , schröder spurred on his party ahead of the sept .
18 election despite polls that show him hopelessly behind challenger angela merkel . " nothing has been decided yet !
do n't be scared off , " said schröder , before 525 spd delegates in berlin . following his 1.5 hour speech , he received a 12 minute standing ovation , and left the stage to cheers of " here we go ! " schröder and merkel have been criss-crossing the country tirelessly in the past few weeks , presenting german voters with alternate visions of the reforms necessary to create jobs and help germany adapt to the demands of globalization . following the american-style party congress of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , the spd planned something more low key to set themselves apart . painting a dire picture instead of singers from the rock musical , " queen , " the spd featured a coal miners men 's choir . and instead of jousting with merkel 's attacks on his past seven years as chancellor , schröder painted a dire picture of a germany under the cdu leader . " they want a society in which solidarity and justice hardly have any place , " he said . rather than continue on his path of modest reforms to germany 's social market economic system , the union parties are proposing radical cuts that will produce a society that 's " cold , one in which people do not stick together , and that is therefore inhumane . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor and his wife doris , one of his most important advisors a majority of germans agree that their system , burdened by inflexible labor laws , the financial cost of reunification and an aging population , needs reforming .
the question is how much . hoping for a turnaround schröder has been appealing to the estimated 20 percent of voters still undecided by promising tough economic reforms that are at the same time " socially just . " but analysts doubt he is being heard .
though they prefer him as chancellor over merkel , voters clearly do not approve of the direction he has taken the country . modest reforms he has introduced to the labor market and social welfare system have cost billions of euros and so far failed to create more jobs .
the number of unemployed in germany last month reached 4.7 million . current polls show merkel 's cdu and its likely coalition partner , the free democrats , at 51 percent of the vote .
schröder 's spd has between 28 and 30 percent of the vote , and their current junior coalition partner the green party , 8 percent . schröder did n't mention the green party during his entire speech , something analysts say indicate he is readying the spd for the possibility of forming a coalition with other parties .
but the chancellor nevertheless remained adamant a turnaround was still possible .
" this election will be decided in the final days , " said schröder . attacking kirchhof following up on an spd strategy that he will likely continue in the coming days , schröder attacked merkel 's shadow finance minister , paul kirchhof .
the former constitutional court judge has proved to be a controversial figure both with the opposition as well as within the ranks of the union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof his calls for a radically reformed tax system are seen by some as not financially feasible .
referring to an earlier paper kirchhof wrote indicating that a woman 's place was in the home , he accused the union of wanting to transport german society " back into the 19th century . " " merkel policies , " he said , " would be for the vast majority of this country negative policies .

the composition of party alliances is perhaps as important as the question of who becomes chancellor .

chancellor gerhard schröder is at his best when his back is against the wall .

" schröder and merkel have been criss-crossing the country tirelessly in the past few weeks , presenting german voters with alternate visions of the reforms necessary to create jobs and help germany adapt to the demands of globalization . following the american-style party congress of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , the spd planned something more low key to set themselves apart . painting a dire picture instead of singers from the rock musical , " queen , " the spd featured a coal miners men 's choir . and instead of jousting with merkel 's attacks on his past seven years as chancellor , schröder painted a dire picture of a germany under the cdu leader . " they want a society in which solidarity and justice hardly have any place , " he said . rather than continue on his path of modest reforms to germany 's social market economic system , the union parties are proposing radical cuts that will produce a society that 's " cold , one in which people do not stick together , and that is therefore inhumane .

the question is how much . hoping for a turnaround schröder has been appealing to the estimated 20 percent of voters still undecided by promising tough economic reforms that are at the same time " socially just . " but analysts doubt he is being heard .
though they prefer him as chancellor over merkel , voters clearly do not approve of the direction he has taken the country . modest reforms he has introduced to the labor market and social welfare system have cost billions of euros and so far failed to create more jobs .
the number of unemployed in germany last month reached 4.7 million . current polls show merkel 's cdu and its likely coalition partner , the free democrats , at 51 percent of the vote .
schröder 's spd has between 28 and 30 percent of the vote , and their current junior coalition partner the green party , 8 percent . schröder did n't mention the green party during his entire speech , something analysts say indicate he is readying the spd for the possibility of forming a coalition with other parties .

"
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .
just think of all the surveys , polls and programs on how depressed the nation is .
it was interesting to see that the visit of the pope had an uplifting effect on the people when he addressed his vaterla n d in its own language .
if anyone can break the gloomy mood in germany it seems it is the pope . ranty islam interviewed derek scally send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

"
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.08.2005 german gambling faces good odds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans spend billions of euros each year on gambling after a slow start , the gambling business in germany has begun to boom .
the growth will likely be accelerated by an expected liberalization in the sports betting market and the soccer world cup in 2006 . german pay-tv channel premiere has placed a huge bet on growth in the gambling sector - and the odds are looking good .
on august 1 , the company started a new channel , premiere win , which will exclusively broadcast betting sports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiere pay-tv station recently launched all-betting channel premiere win so far the young channel has shown horse races from around the world , but plans to branch out into other sports - soccer , handball , formula 1 racing - are in the works .
premiere win viewers can go online and place bets with premiere partner betandwin , a private bookmaker .
the move was a natural one for premiere , which broadcasts all the matches of the german bundesliga soccer league live and has the rights to live broadcasts of all 64 world cup matches in 2006 .
all aboard the gravy train " it was just a question of being the first one to get on the train , " said dietrich wüstehoff , head of pr at premiere win .
premiere is just one of many companies looking to take a seat at the betting banquet .
others include the german football league -lrb- dsl -rrb- , commercial tv station rtl and sports channel dsf .
" the german sports betting market is right on the edge of taking off because of the liberalization expected in the near future , " wüstehoff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gamblers can bet on many combinations - like who will get the first foul currently , state-run german bookmaker oddset has a monopoly on most sports betting , but that is being challenged in the courts , and a hearing is slated for nov .
8 .
when the decision comes early next year , it is widely expected to open up the betting market for competition - just in time for the world cup games .
changes afoot in addition to oddset , five other firms hold licenses to operate in germany , including betandwin , whose license dates back to the east german era .
in addition , numerous small bookmaking parlors , whose businesses are incorporated in other countries , have sprung up in germany in recent years .
mostly present in berlin , they operate in a sort of legal grey area .

"
chancellor gerhard schröder is at his best when his back is against the wall .
at his spd party congress on wednesday , he tried passing on some of that energy on to his party in the waning weeks of the campaign . gravel voiced and employing the entire arsenal of his vaunted communicative skills , schröder spurred on his party ahead of the sept .
18 election despite polls that show him hopelessly behind challenger angela merkel . " nothing has been decided yet !
do n't be scared off , " said schröder , before 525 spd delegates in berlin . following his 1.5 hour speech , he received a 12 minute standing ovation , and left the stage to cheers of " here we go ! " schröder and merkel have been criss-crossing the country tirelessly in the past few weeks , presenting german voters with alternate visions of the reforms necessary to create jobs and help germany adapt to the demands of globalization . following the american-style party congress of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , the spd planned something more low key to set themselves apart . painting a dire picture instead of singers from the rock musical , " queen , " the spd featured a coal miners men 's choir . and instead of jousting with merkel 's attacks on his past seven years as chancellor , schröder painted a dire picture of a germany under the cdu leader . " they want a society in which solidarity and justice hardly have any place , " he said . rather than continue on his path of modest reforms to germany 's social market economic system , the union parties are proposing radical cuts that will produce a society that 's " cold , one in which people do not stick together , and that is therefore inhumane . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor and his wife doris , one of his most important advisors a majority of germans agree that their system , burdened by inflexible labor laws , the financial cost of reunification and an aging population , needs reforming .
the question is how much . hoping for a turnaround schröder has been appealing to the estimated 20 percent of voters still undecided by promising tough economic reforms that are at the same time " socially just . " but analysts doubt he is being heard .
though they prefer him as chancellor over merkel , voters clearly do not approve of the direction he has taken the country . modest reforms he has introduced to the labor market and social welfare system have cost billions of euros and so far failed to create more jobs .
the number of unemployed in germany last month reached 4.7 million . current polls show merkel 's cdu and its likely coalition partner , the free democrats , at 51 percent of the vote .
schröder 's spd has between 28 and 30 percent of the vote , and their current junior coalition partner the green party , 8 percent . schröder did n't mention the green party during his entire speech , something analysts say indicate he is readying the spd for the possibility of forming a coalition with other parties .
but the chancellor nevertheless remained adamant a turnaround was still possible .
" this election will be decided in the final days , " said schröder . attacking kirchhof following up on an spd strategy that he will likely continue in the coming days , schröder attacked merkel 's shadow finance minister , paul kirchhof .
the former constitutional court judge has proved to be a controversial figure both with the opposition as well as within the ranks of the union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof his calls for a radically reformed tax system are seen by some as not financially feasible .
referring to an earlier paper kirchhof wrote indicating that a woman 's place was in the home , he accused the union of wanting to transport german society " back into the 19th century . " " merkel policies , " he said , " would be for the vast majority of this country negative policies .

chancellor gerhard schröder is at his best when his back is against the wall .

" schröder and merkel have been criss-crossing the country tirelessly in the past few weeks , presenting german voters with alternate visions of the reforms necessary to create jobs and help germany adapt to the demands of globalization . following the american-style party congress of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , the spd planned something more low key to set themselves apart . painting a dire picture instead of singers from the rock musical , " queen , " the spd featured a coal miners men 's choir . and instead of jousting with merkel 's attacks on his past seven years as chancellor , schröder painted a dire picture of a germany under the cdu leader . " they want a society in which solidarity and justice hardly have any place , " he said . rather than continue on his path of modest reforms to germany 's social market economic system , the union parties are proposing radical cuts that will produce a society that 's " cold , one in which people do not stick together , and that is therefore inhumane .

the question is how much . hoping for a turnaround schröder has been appealing to the estimated 20 percent of voters still undecided by promising tough economic reforms that are at the same time " socially just . " but analysts doubt he is being heard .
though they prefer him as chancellor over merkel , voters clearly do not approve of the direction he has taken the country . modest reforms he has introduced to the labor market and social welfare system have cost billions of euros and so far failed to create more jobs .
the number of unemployed in germany last month reached 4.7 million . current polls show merkel 's cdu and its likely coalition partner , the free democrats , at 51 percent of the vote .
schröder 's spd has between 28 and 30 percent of the vote , and their current junior coalition partner the green party , 8 percent . schröder did n't mention the green party during his entire speech , something analysts say indicate he is readying the spd for the possibility of forming a coalition with other parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed what can the world expect post-kyoto ? drastic climate change affects germany opinion : a good beginning , but that 's all europe -pipe- 31.08.2005 opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurricane katrina left a trail of destruction in its wake even as the damage caused by hurricane katrina in the us is assessed , the reason for its brutality is already known - global warming .
it underlines yet again there is no alternative to global climate protection . damages of about $ 30 billion , a large city almost completely evacuated and 70 percent of it under water - hurricane katrina has proved that water and storms are still the worst natural catastrophes .
the southern part of the us is aware of that and has been for a long time .
tropical storms emerging from the warm sea are n't a rarity and the warmer it is , the stronger they are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of moss point , miss . , make their way to safety .
not insignificantly , humans have contributed to this new fury unleashed by global climate change - more concretely , by burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal which in turn release carbon dioxide .
listening to the experts not fashionable climate experts have been saying it for years : it 's not the number of hurricanes that 's increasing but rather their intensity .
but the experts were first ignored by politicians and then mildly snickered at .
at present , their theories are being angrily rejected , even though many of their scenarios are becoming reality , simply because their statements are uncomfortable .
that 's because the experts also explain what mankind can and must do in order to stop the greenhouse effect - in order to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , one needs different energy sources such as wind and sun and more gas instead of coal , more fuel-efficient cars and more energy savings .
all that was popular at the beginning of the 1990s when the world 's nations met in rio de janeiro and agreed on a global environment policy .
the euphoria was heady given that it came about so soon after the fall of the iron curtain .
many things , if not all , seemed possible - even a solution to climate problems .
dashed hopes but much has happened since .
the new economy collapsed , the horrific vision of international terrorism took shape , the economies of leading industrial nations lurched from crisis to crisis and the preservation of the environment slipped from world attention .
the us , which initially helped shape the new global environment policy , shrank back from once concrete steps had to be taken .
bildunterschrift : palm trees are bent from the force of hurricane katrina in an area hit by hurricane ivan last september in the grande lagoon area of pensacola , florida the talks on the kyoto protocol which began on a hopeful note proved to be laborious and tough .
the results are pitiful when compared to the demands .
the treaty , which was sealed in february 2005 , allows worldwide emission levels to stagnate , at the very best .
talk of reducing them has all but evaporated and the us is simply not playing along any more .
the americans love their gas-guzzling pickup trucks and their gigantic refrigerators .
the average us citizen consumes twice the amount of energy than the average european , who in turn consumes much more than an african .
soon , the upcoming asian countries of india and china will ensure that energy consumption will rise drastically .
there 's no doubt that the outlook for the world climate looks gloomy .
no alternative to global climate protection still , there 's no alternative to an international effort for climate policy - the greenhouse effect is hardly restrained by boundaries .
the rich western nations must develop and promote technologies in their own countries that could help stop global warming worldwide .
the industrial nations must develop instruments - emissions trading is one of them - with which they can put a lid on their emissions and then reduce them .
bildunterschrift : floodwaters surround a car in uptown new orleans .
in other words , politicians , in particular us president bush , must realize that climate experts and scientists are n't some kind of doomsday prophets .
their warnings must finally be taken seriously .
environment and climate protection is a question of existence , not one of luxury .
it 's not a matter that politicians only address during good times - when the economy is humming along - as is often the case in germany if this realization does n't set in soon , then we 're going to have to get used to damages in the billions caused by storms , floods , heat and famine - damages that at some point we wo n't be able to pay for . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european cities face future heatwaves a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future .

18 general election , the number of people looking for work in germany declined in august , official data showed wednesday , a development the government hailed as the long-awaited turnaround on the country 's troubled labor market .
according to the latest calculations by the federal labor agency in nuremberg , the german jobless total declined by 44,000 to 4.728 million in raw or unadjusted terms this month , bringing the jobless rate down to 11.4 percent from 11.5 percent .
the improvement reversed - at least partially - the increase in unemployment seen the previous month .
in july , the jobless queues had lengthened as students and school-leavers signed on at the start of the summer holidays .
the fall in unemployment , however modest , will come as a welcome piece of news for the current government under chancellor gerhard schröder , who is facing possible defeat in the sept .

richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .

so the debate is not about whether reform is needed but of what kind and how radical .
and there is no doubt that germany has tremendous resources on which to build economic recovery - highly skilled and educated individuals , a good infrastructure , technological knowledge .

richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .
of course unemployment is a problem , but there may be a bit of a tendency amongst germans to exaggerate the nature of their plight .

one of the striking things about the political mainstream parties , with the exception of the li n kspartei -lsb- the new left party -rsb- is , that they all agree the country badly needs thorough economic reform for germany to become more competitive and to be able to afford itself .
so the debate is not about whether reform is needed but of what kind and how radical .
and there is no doubt that germany has tremendous resources on which to build economic recovery - highly skilled and educated individuals , a good infrastructure , technological knowledge .
but there needs to be more private responsibility .
i would like to see greater development of a non-governmental civic society and a departure from this attitude that the state needs to take care of everything .
i think this is also one of the reasons for the situation of the education system .

schröder will urge his party to fight to the end german chancellor gerhard schröder will be officially named wednesday as the leading candidate of his ruling social democrats for the election on sept .
18 .
he will then call on his party to fight from behind to win . at a party conference in berlin , the chancellor will be trying to boost the confidence of his fellow social democrats and precipitate what he hopes will be a come-from-behind victory . with just about two weeks to go until the election the social democrats are lagging hopelessly behind the conservatives led by angela merkel .
but schröder , who has a history of tough political struggles and unexpected wins , is determined to sway public opinion at the last minute .
these days schröder is still able to draw the masses to town squares and halls , in a bid to dispel images of him as a lame duck chancellor on his farewell tour of germany . but the political wares he ’ s hawking - like the social renewal of germany that he wants to continue or germany ’ s rising international importance which he wants to consolidate - appear to have lost their shine with the population at large . with 18 days to go before the general election , opinion polls are currently giving a conservative-liberal alliance an absolute majority and a 12 point lead over the chancellor 's spd and their green party allies .
yet gerhard schröder 's personal and political history has always been one of tough fights and surprise victories . a man accustomed to fighting adversity born in april 1944 in the west german town of mossenberg , his childhood was marked by postwar destitution of which the schröder family had more than a fair share . bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , far left , the boy who grew to be chancellor . " i had a happy childhood although it was mostly marked by austere circumstances and little access to education , " he says .
" i missed that badly but my mother never had money for that .
so i ’ ve had to elbow my way up , as it were . " schröder 's father died in world war ii , leaving behind his wife , who was a cleaning woman , and five siblings .
at 19 schröder joined the social democrats and worked at a building site to fund night school classes through which he earned his high school diploma at the age of 22 . schröder qualified as a lawyer before becoming leader of the social democrat ’ s youth wing in 1978 .
his star ascended fully in 1990 when he became premier of the state of lower saxony at the second attempt .
his campaign for the chancellorship in 1998 sent a gush of fresh air through germany , carrying the promise of an end to the inertia that marked the twilight of 16 years of conservative rule . unseating kohl the political highpoint on sept .
27 , 1998 schröder reached the peak of his political career .
he unseated conservative chancellor helmut kohl by winning 41 percent of the vote and by forming an alliance with joschka fischer 's green party . bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder hugs oskar lafontaine as the results come in for the 1998 general elction . schröder became the first postwar german leader to back the country ’ s economic muscle with military might .
he made germany participate in the war in kosovo in 1999 and in afghanistan three years later . on the domestic front , however , he lost the fight against mass unemployment and as a consequence barely managed to cling on to the chancellorship in the 2002 election .
observers believe he only won by opposing us president george w. bush on the iraq war and by refusing to commit german troops . schröder criticized for unemployment and reforms this year his campaign returns to a country struggling with a record unemployment - despite news on wednesday that the jobless figures had dropped to 4.728 million in raw , or unadjusted , terms in august from 4.77 million in july . schröder also faces a population disillusioned with a series of painful labor market and welfare reforms .

schröder will urge his party to fight to the end german chancellor gerhard schröder will be officially named wednesday as the leading candidate of his ruling social democrats for the election on sept .
18 .
he will then call on his party to fight from behind to win . at a party conference in berlin , the chancellor will be trying to boost the confidence of his fellow social democrats and precipitate what he hopes will be a come-from-behind victory . with just about two weeks to go until the election the social democrats are lagging hopelessly behind the conservatives led by angela merkel .
but schröder , who has a history of tough political struggles and unexpected wins , is determined to sway public opinion at the last minute .
these days schröder is still able to draw the masses to town squares and halls , in a bid to dispel images of him as a lame duck chancellor on his farewell tour of germany . but the political wares he ’ s hawking - like the social renewal of germany that he wants to continue or germany ’ s rising international importance which he wants to consolidate - appear to have lost their shine with the population at large . with 18 days to go before the general election , opinion polls are currently giving a conservative-liberal alliance an absolute majority and a 12 point lead over the chancellor 's spd and their green party allies .
yet gerhard schröder 's personal and political history has always been one of tough fights and surprise victories . a man accustomed to fighting adversity born in april 1944 in the west german town of mossenberg , his childhood was marked by postwar destitution of which the schröder family had more than a fair share . bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , far left , the boy who grew to be chancellor . " i had a happy childhood although it was mostly marked by austere circumstances and little access to education , " he says .
" i missed that badly but my mother never had money for that .
so i ’ ve had to elbow my way up , as it were . " schröder 's father died in world war ii , leaving behind his wife , who was a cleaning woman , and five siblings .
at 19 schröder joined the social democrats and worked at a building site to fund night school classes through which he earned his high school diploma at the age of 22 . schröder qualified as a lawyer before becoming leader of the social democrat ’ s youth wing in 1978 .
his star ascended fully in 1990 when he became premier of the state of lower saxony at the second attempt .
his campaign for the chancellorship in 1998 sent a gush of fresh air through germany , carrying the promise of an end to the inertia that marked the twilight of 16 years of conservative rule . unseating kohl the political highpoint on sept .

most readers were opposed asked their opinion on turkey joining the european union , the majority of dw-world readers who answered were staunchly opposed . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
healthy multiculturalism ?
is that what we are seeing in spain , holland , london and germany ?
a yet larger muslim population combined with dismal demographic numbers for european birth rates means visitors to europe will soon need to bring their arabic dictionaries .
this may offend liberal sensibilities but once a culture is swallowed up it will not return .
european culture has been the light of the world -lrb- although not lately -rrb- and it is worth protecting .
and i do n't mean from coca cola .
j.l. ronish we should not forget that a good portion of europe was under the yoke of the ottoman empire -lrb- i.e. , turkey -rrb- for many years .
the turks are of asian nature .
they are muslim and not christian european .
the muslims have been trying to gain control of the rest of europe for centuries .
h. regner unlucky marriage ?
i see the eu-turkish relationship like a couple .
turkey and the eu have been dating for a very long time with promises and commitments along the way .
they made plans to get engaged on oct .
3 .
the question is how will eu administrators tell turkey that its family -lrb- the public -rrb- is opposed to the marriage ?
ersan tasli if turkey is admitted to the eu , it will become the trojan horse of europe .
europe suffers from a catastrophic demographic problem , which has been underestimated by the various socialist-liberal governments .
turkey would be the second most populous eu country .
the greeks would suffer most .
we would disappear off the map .
manolis alifierakis , greece turkey is not part of europe and should not be admitted to the eu .
i realize the us is keen to see turkey join but of course they have their own agenda : the last thing the bush administration wants to see is a strong and independent europe .
an alliance 's strength is measured more by it 's unity than it 's size .
turkey would only weaken europe by it 's presence .
bob rehling , australia turkey does not belong in the eu because it does n't honor the principles of religious rights , human rights , minority rights , or democratic rule .
finally , it occupies and colonizes an eu member state - cyprus .
m.g. ikossi md , phd just one in favor ...
i am sure turkey belongs in the eu .
maybe not in the short run , but in the long run .
turkey will be a most important eu ally , not only in economic terms but military and other issues as well .
turkey joining the eu is a win-win situation .
they need each other .
izmir , turkey turkey 's recognition of cyprus turkey should not necessarily be required to recognize ' greek ' cyprus as the sole representative of the cypriot government .
this disregards any of the legitimate concerns leading to the 1974 invasion by turkey and also the recent affirmative reunification votes by the turkish cypriots that the greeks rejected .
once cyprus is reunited , then fine , recognition would become a prerequisite .
but not until then .
dave alexander , northern ireland .
if the eu is all about friendship and peace , how can it be that turkey does n't even recognize cyprus ?
is that friendship ?

a new study shows the german trend toward shifting jobs overseas is growing in the r & d sector - but business advocates try to look at the bright side . the poll by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- surveyed 4,400 internationally active companies , including small and medium-sized businesses .
nearly 30 percent of the companies had already moved part of their operations overseas or had plans to do so , the study showed .
for the most part , the companies that planned to shift research and development capacity abroad were those that had moved production there earlier .
businesses cited lower wages abroad , proximity to clients and demands of the marketplace as their reasons for the increased overseas presence .

while the increase in jobs abroad did help keep the german economy afloat , the situation could be much better for germany , said dihk head ludwig-georg braun .
staying positive " the dynamics of foreign economies could have a more positive effect on german jobs if many companies would not opt to move their production and research and development overseas , " braun said .
in an effort to see the positive side of the results , braun noted that the study clearly showed international activity helped keep sales and personnel levels afloat at home .

another 22 percent said they had laid off personnel .
the more companies moved production abroad , however , the more they would consider moving research and development jobs as well , braun warned .
companies most frequently moved production to new eu member states and to asia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.08.2005 german gambling faces good odds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans spend billions of euros each year on gambling after a slow start , the gambling business in germany has begun to boom .
the growth will likely be accelerated by an expected liberalization in the sports betting market and the soccer world cup in 2006 . german pay-tv channel premiere has placed a huge bet on growth in the gambling sector - and the odds are looking good .
on august 1 , the company started a new channel , premiere win , which will exclusively broadcast betting sports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiere pay-tv station recently launched all-betting channel premiere win so far the young channel has shown horse races from around the world , but plans to branch out into other sports - soccer , handball , formula 1 racing - are in the works .
premiere win viewers can go online and place bets with premiere partner betandwin , a private bookmaker .
the move was a natural one for premiere , which broadcasts all the matches of the german bundesliga soccer league live and has the rights to live broadcasts of all 64 world cup matches in 2006 .
all aboard the gravy train " it was just a question of being the first one to get on the train , " said dietrich wüstehoff , head of pr at premiere win .
premiere is just one of many companies looking to take a seat at the betting banquet .
others include the german football league -lrb- dsl -rrb- , commercial tv station rtl and sports channel dsf .
" the german sports betting market is right on the edge of taking off because of the liberalization expected in the near future , " wüstehoff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gamblers can bet on many combinations - like who will get the first foul currently , state-run german bookmaker oddset has a monopoly on most sports betting , but that is being challenged in the courts , and a hearing is slated for nov .
8 .
when the decision comes early next year , it is widely expected to open up the betting market for competition - just in time for the world cup games .
changes afoot in addition to oddset , five other firms hold licenses to operate in germany , including betandwin , whose license dates back to the east german era .
in addition , numerous small bookmaking parlors , whose businesses are incorporated in other countries , have sprung up in germany in recent years .
mostly present in berlin , they operate in a sort of legal grey area .
if the market is opened up , these betting parlors can expect to become completely legitimate .
in that case , industry insiders say , germany 's betting scene will look more like england 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william hill betting office syndicate , london , great britain " we assume that in the long term , 10,000 betting offices will open up in germany , " the european betting association ’ s norbert teufelberger told the internet portal focus money .
the german association of bookmakers has said the market liberalization could create as many as 30,000 jobs .
on the down side , the competition from private betting agencies means a smaller share of the pie for the state-run betting companies , and thus less money flowing into government coffers .
big spenders , big business betting in germany is already big business .
gamblers spent three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- on sports bets alone in 2004 .
that could grow to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.1 billion -rrb- by 2010 , according to a study by munich-based mecn consulting group published in capital magazine .
the same study showed 30 billion euros was spent on other types of gambling , such as internet poker , official numbers picking -lrb- lottery games -rrb- and state-run casinos .
everyone agrees that the advent of internet gambling , which allows punters to place bets without having to get out of their bathrobes , has played a large role in the growth of the industry .
worldwide , surfers spent some 300 billion on internet gambling in 2004 , with all signs pointing to continued rapid growth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a horse passes the sunrise during the morning trackwork at the nad al sheba horse race track in dubai stephan schröder , head of pr at the cologne-based sports research company sport & markt , notes that many gambling internet sites have been made so easy to use that " i hate to say it , but even an idiot can understand it . "
room for growth despite the large sums already being spent , a report put out by sport & markt shows there is still a lot of room for growth in the sector .
of the 65 million germans over age 14 , just seven million have placed sports bets , the study showed .
" that ’ s a lot of people , but it leaves a large untapped market , " schröder said .
surprisingly , the recent , much-reported scandal involving soccer referee robert hoyzer - he was involved in a croation gambling ring and fixed several games - has also given sports betting a boost .
" our numbers have leapt since the scandal hit the newspapers , " marcus meyer , marketing chief for betandwin , told the handelsblatt newspaper recently .
" the hoyzer case was a big topic on tv every day last spring .
in the reports , sports betting was explained , " he said .
" now it seems people want to try it for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formula one racing is a popular betting sport sport & markt 's schröder agrees that in terms of the gambling business , any news can be good news .
" in germany , people are relatively new to sports betting .
wherever they hear about it , it means they might want to try it out , " he said .
one other factor may stand behind the growth in germans ' willingness to plunk down a few euros for a chance at big money : the ailing economy .
" when people are n't doing well , there 's more of a tendency to try and win big , " said schröder .
" more people have less to lose , and they wish they could change their lives in an instant .

it underlines yet again there is no alternative to global climate protection . damages of about $ 30 billion , a large city almost completely evacuated and 70 percent of it under water - hurricane katrina has proved that water and storms are still the worst natural catastrophes .
the southern part of the us is aware of that and has been for a long time .
tropical storms emerging from the warm sea are n't a rarity and the warmer it is , the stronger they are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of moss point , miss . , make their way to safety .
not insignificantly , humans have contributed to this new fury unleashed by global climate change - more concretely , by burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal which in turn release carbon dioxide .
listening to the experts not fashionable climate experts have been saying it for years : it 's not the number of hurricanes that 's increasing but rather their intensity .
but the experts were first ignored by politicians and then mildly snickered at .
at present , their theories are being angrily rejected , even though many of their scenarios are becoming reality , simply because their statements are uncomfortable .
that 's because the experts also explain what mankind can and must do in order to stop the greenhouse effect - in order to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , one needs different energy sources such as wind and sun and more gas instead of coal , more fuel-efficient cars and more energy savings .
all that was popular at the beginning of the 1990s when the world 's nations met in rio de janeiro and agreed on a global environment policy .
the euphoria was heady given that it came about so soon after the fall of the iron curtain .
many things , if not all , seemed possible - even a solution to climate problems .
dashed hopes but much has happened since .
the new economy collapsed , the horrific vision of international terrorism took shape , the economies of leading industrial nations lurched from crisis to crisis and the preservation of the environment slipped from world attention .
the us , which initially helped shape the new global environment policy , shrank back from once concrete steps had to be taken .
bildunterschrift : palm trees are bent from the force of hurricane katrina in an area hit by hurricane ivan last september in the grande lagoon area of pensacola , florida the talks on the kyoto protocol which began on a hopeful note proved to be laborious and tough .
the results are pitiful when compared to the demands .
the treaty , which was sealed in february 2005 , allows worldwide emission levels to stagnate , at the very best .
talk of reducing them has all but evaporated and the us is simply not playing along any more .
the americans love their gas-guzzling pickup trucks and their gigantic refrigerators .
the average us citizen consumes twice the amount of energy than the average european , who in turn consumes much more than an african .
soon , the upcoming asian countries of india and china will ensure that energy consumption will rise drastically .
there 's no doubt that the outlook for the world climate looks gloomy .
no alternative to global climate protection still , there 's no alternative to an international effort for climate policy - the greenhouse effect is hardly restrained by boundaries .
the rich western nations must develop and promote technologies in their own countries that could help stop global warming worldwide .
the industrial nations must develop instruments - emissions trading is one of them - with which they can put a lid on their emissions and then reduce them .
bildunterschrift : floodwaters surround a car in uptown new orleans .
in other words , politicians , in particular us president bush , must realize that climate experts and scientists are n't some kind of doomsday prophets .
their warnings must finally be taken seriously .
environment and climate protection is a question of existence , not one of luxury .
it 's not a matter that politicians only address during good times - when the economy is humming along - as is often the case in germany if this realization does n't set in soon , then we 're going to have to get used to damages in the billions caused by storms , floods , heat and famine - damages that at some point we wo n't be able to pay for . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european cities face future heatwaves a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future .

"
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .

what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .

"
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .

the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .
just think of all the surveys , polls and programs on how depressed the nation is .
it was interesting to see that the visit of the pope had an uplifting effect on the people when he addressed his vaterla n d in its own language .
if anyone can break the gloomy mood in germany it seems it is the pope . ranty islam interviewed derek scally send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

the growth will likely be accelerated by an expected liberalization in the sports betting market and the soccer world cup in 2006 . german pay-tv channel premiere has placed a huge bet on growth in the gambling sector - and the odds are looking good .
on august 1 , the company started a new channel , premiere win , which will exclusively broadcast betting sports .

premiere win viewers can go online and place bets with premiere partner betandwin , a private bookmaker .
the move was a natural one for premiere , which broadcasts all the matches of the german bundesliga soccer league live and has the rights to live broadcasts of all 64 world cup matches in 2006 .
all aboard the gravy train " it was just a question of being the first one to get on the train , " said dietrich wüstehoff , head of pr at premiere win .
premiere is just one of many companies looking to take a seat at the betting banquet .
others include the german football league -lrb- dsl -rrb- , commercial tv station rtl and sports channel dsf .

in addition , numerous small bookmaking parlors , whose businesses are incorporated in other countries , have sprung up in germany in recent years .
mostly present in berlin , they operate in a sort of legal grey area .
if the market is opened up , these betting parlors can expect to become completely legitimate .
in that case , industry insiders say , germany 's betting scene will look more like england 's .

the german association of bookmakers has said the market liberalization could create as many as 30,000 jobs .
on the down side , the competition from private betting agencies means a smaller share of the pie for the state-run betting companies , and thus less money flowing into government coffers .
big spenders , big business betting in germany is already big business .
gamblers spent three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- on sports bets alone in 2004 .
that could grow to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.1 billion -rrb- by 2010 , according to a study by munich-based mecn consulting group published in capital magazine .
the same study showed 30 billion euros was spent on other types of gambling , such as internet poker , official numbers picking -lrb- lottery games -rrb- and state-run casinos .
everyone agrees that the advent of internet gambling , which allows punters to place bets without having to get out of their bathrobes , has played a large role in the growth of the industry .

room for growth despite the large sums already being spent , a report put out by sport & markt shows there is still a lot of room for growth in the sector .
of the 65 million germans over age 14 , just seven million have placed sports bets , the study showed .
" that ’ s a lot of people , but it leaves a large untapped market , " schröder said .
surprisingly , the recent , much-reported scandal involving soccer referee robert hoyzer - he was involved in a croation gambling ring and fixed several games - has also given sports betting a boost .
" our numbers have leapt since the scandal hit the newspapers , " marcus meyer , marketing chief for betandwin , told the handelsblatt newspaper recently .
" the hoyzer case was a big topic on tv every day last spring .

it underlines yet again there is no alternative to global climate protection . damages of about $ 30 billion , a large city almost completely evacuated and 70 percent of it under water - hurricane katrina has proved that water and storms are still the worst natural catastrophes .
the southern part of the us is aware of that and has been for a long time .
tropical storms emerging from the warm sea are n't a rarity and the warmer it is , the stronger they are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of moss point , miss . , make their way to safety .
not insignificantly , humans have contributed to this new fury unleashed by global climate change - more concretely , by burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal which in turn release carbon dioxide .
listening to the experts not fashionable climate experts have been saying it for years : it 's not the number of hurricanes that 's increasing but rather their intensity .
but the experts were first ignored by politicians and then mildly snickered at .
at present , their theories are being angrily rejected , even though many of their scenarios are becoming reality , simply because their statements are uncomfortable .
that 's because the experts also explain what mankind can and must do in order to stop the greenhouse effect - in order to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , one needs different energy sources such as wind and sun and more gas instead of coal , more fuel-efficient cars and more energy savings .
all that was popular at the beginning of the 1990s when the world 's nations met in rio de janeiro and agreed on a global environment policy .
the euphoria was heady given that it came about so soon after the fall of the iron curtain .
many things , if not all , seemed possible - even a solution to climate problems .
dashed hopes but much has happened since .
the new economy collapsed , the horrific vision of international terrorism took shape , the economies of leading industrial nations lurched from crisis to crisis and the preservation of the environment slipped from world attention .
the us , which initially helped shape the new global environment policy , shrank back from once concrete steps had to be taken .
bildunterschrift : palm trees are bent from the force of hurricane katrina in an area hit by hurricane ivan last september in the grande lagoon area of pensacola , florida the talks on the kyoto protocol which began on a hopeful note proved to be laborious and tough .
the results are pitiful when compared to the demands .
the treaty , which was sealed in february 2005 , allows worldwide emission levels to stagnate , at the very best .
talk of reducing them has all but evaporated and the us is simply not playing along any more .
the americans love their gas-guzzling pickup trucks and their gigantic refrigerators .
the average us citizen consumes twice the amount of energy than the average european , who in turn consumes much more than an african .
soon , the upcoming asian countries of india and china will ensure that energy consumption will rise drastically .
there 's no doubt that the outlook for the world climate looks gloomy .
no alternative to global climate protection still , there 's no alternative to an international effort for climate policy - the greenhouse effect is hardly restrained by boundaries .
the rich western nations must develop and promote technologies in their own countries that could help stop global warming worldwide .
the industrial nations must develop instruments - emissions trading is one of them - with which they can put a lid on their emissions and then reduce them .
bildunterschrift : floodwaters surround a car in uptown new orleans .
in other words , politicians , in particular us president bush , must realize that climate experts and scientists are n't some kind of doomsday prophets .
their warnings must finally be taken seriously .
environment and climate protection is a question of existence , not one of luxury .

what does he make of the situation in pre-election germany ? dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .
of course unemployment is a problem , but there may be a bit of a tendency amongst germans to exaggerate the nature of their plight .
from an american standpoint , the social problems seem manageable .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y , to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
one of the striking things about the political mainstream parties , with the exception of the li n kspartei -lsb- the new left party -rsb- is , that they all agree the country badly needs thorough economic reform for germany to become more competitive and to be able to afford itself .
so the debate is not about whether reform is needed but of what kind and how radical .
and there is no doubt that germany has tremendous resources on which to build economic recovery - highly skilled and educated individuals , a good infrastructure , technological knowledge .
but there needs to be more private responsibility .
i would like to see greater development of a non-governmental civic society and a departure from this attitude that the state needs to take care of everything .
i think this is also one of the reasons for the situation of the education system .
the state can no longer finance free for all education .
german universities are still very good but do not compare anymore with the top institutions in the us and britain .

berlin is a wonderful city to live in .
a great deal of 20th century history happened here and now germany is struggling to make history of a different sort .
it 's fascinating to see how germany looks back on its history and forward at the same time .
germans have reflected on their history more than any other country with dark stains such as japan and the us .

today , the main streets of the baltic seaport were draped in the red and white of poland , with solidarity logos and huge posters recalling that the wave of strikes across the country in august 1980 - but especially the much-publicized gdansk shipyard strike - were the first brave steps towards ending communism in europe .
graffiti commissioned by the city authorities at one of the entrances to the port remind visitors and residents of the names of key players and events in the heady days of 1980 that led to the birth of the movement .
bildunterschrift : on one wall , an artist paid tribute to anna walentynowicz , the crane operator whose sacking sparked the shipyard strike on august 14 , 1980 .
on another , graffiti depict an underground printing press , where workers published illegal fliers against the communist regime .
spotlight on walesa on yet another , a street artist depicted a huge crowd gathered outside the lenin shipyard in gdansk during the august 1980 strike , as strike leader lech walesa signed an agreement with the communist bosses , giving victory to the workers .
on august 31 , walesa emerged from more than two weeks of talks between the strikers and shipyard bosses , and proclaimed to his fellow workers : " we have free , independent trade unions . "
solidarity , described by walesa as the greatest proletarian monopoly ever and the only movement able to take on communism , was born .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the solidarity logo " every time i come here , my heart does ten to the dozen , " shipyard worker maria wojciechowska told afp outside the gates of the sprawling industrial complex , now a mere skeleton of its glorious past , when poland built ships for the soviets .
the austere perimeter walls were bedecked with flowers on wednesday , a picture of the late pope john paul ii and an effigy of the black madonna of czestochowa .
evoking the pope walesa , a devout catholic , is said to have worn a lapel pin of the black madonna during the shipyard strike , and was close to and inspired by the late polish-born pope , whom he cited in a speech made to both houses of parliament on monday to kick off three days of events to mark solidarity 's creation .
" what changed the face of this land came from us , from our hearts and our souls , " walesa said , paraphrasing a speech pronounced in 1979 by john paul ii on his first pilgrimage to poland .
near the entrance to the shipyard , by a towering monument to polish workers killed by the communist government , some 20 heads of state and government will join dignitaries from around the world and solidarity leaders for a ceremony to mark the occasion . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland .

a new study shows the german trend toward shifting jobs overseas is growing in the r & d sector - but business advocates try to look at the bright side . the poll by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- surveyed 4,400 internationally active companies , including small and medium-sized businesses .
nearly 30 percent of the companies had already moved part of their operations overseas or had plans to do so , the study showed .
for the most part , the companies that planned to shift research and development capacity abroad were those that had moved production there earlier .
businesses cited lower wages abroad , proximity to clients and demands of the marketplace as their reasons for the increased overseas presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens makes cell phones in brazil only 3 percent of those who had moved production or research facilities abroad would like to bring them back to germany , the study showed .
while the increase in jobs abroad did help keep the german economy afloat , the situation could be much better for germany , said dihk head ludwig-georg braun .
staying positive " the dynamics of foreign economies could have a more positive effect on german jobs if many companies would not opt to move their production and research and development overseas , " braun said .
in an effort to see the positive side of the results , braun noted that the study clearly showed international activity helped keep sales and personnel levels afloat at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish launderers clean linens for berlin hotels according to the report , 55 percent of the companies polled had improved sales as a result of their move .
some 37 percent of respondents said that since moving some activities overseas , they had been able to expand within germany .
another 22 percent said they had laid off personnel .
the more companies moved production abroad , however , the more they would consider moving research and development jobs as well , braun warned .
companies most frequently moved production to new eu member states and to asia .
hopes for future braun said he hoped a new government would help boost the country in terms of innovation , development and research .
and he hoped that foreign investors would begin to see germany as an attractive location for their businesses . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.08.2005 celebrating solidarity , 25 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walesa flashes " v " for victory on the trade union 's anniversary in gdansk , poland has been celebrating the 25th anniversary of the birth of solidarity , the first independent trade union in the communist bloc and a catalyst that led to the fall of the iron curtain . a quarter of a century ago , a strike at the sprawling lenin shipyard on the baltic sea ended and solidarity was born .
today , the main streets of the baltic seaport were draped in the red and white of poland , with solidarity logos and huge posters recalling that the wave of strikes across the country in august 1980 - but especially the much-publicized gdansk shipyard strike - were the first brave steps towards ending communism in europe .
graffiti commissioned by the city authorities at one of the entrances to the port remind visitors and residents of the names of key players and events in the heady days of 1980 that led to the birth of the movement .
bildunterschrift : on one wall , an artist paid tribute to anna walentynowicz , the crane operator whose sacking sparked the shipyard strike on august 14 , 1980 .
on another , graffiti depict an underground printing press , where workers published illegal fliers against the communist regime .
spotlight on walesa on yet another , a street artist depicted a huge crowd gathered outside the lenin shipyard in gdansk during the august 1980 strike , as strike leader lech walesa signed an agreement with the communist bosses , giving victory to the workers .
on august 31 , walesa emerged from more than two weeks of talks between the strikers and shipyard bosses , and proclaimed to his fellow workers : " we have free , independent trade unions . "
solidarity , described by walesa as the greatest proletarian monopoly ever and the only movement able to take on communism , was born .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the solidarity logo " every time i come here , my heart does ten to the dozen , " shipyard worker maria wojciechowska told afp outside the gates of the sprawling industrial complex , now a mere skeleton of its glorious past , when poland built ships for the soviets .
the austere perimeter walls were bedecked with flowers on wednesday , a picture of the late pope john paul ii and an effigy of the black madonna of czestochowa .
evoking the pope walesa , a devout catholic , is said to have worn a lapel pin of the black madonna during the shipyard strike , and was close to and inspired by the late polish-born pope , whom he cited in a speech made to both houses of parliament on monday to kick off three days of events to mark solidarity 's creation .
" what changed the face of this land came from us , from our hearts and our souls , " walesa said , paraphrasing a speech pronounced in 1979 by john paul ii on his first pilgrimage to poland .
near the entrance to the shipyard , by a towering monument to polish workers killed by the communist government , some 20 heads of state and government will join dignitaries from around the world and solidarity leaders for a ceremony to mark the occasion . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland .

bob rehling , australia turkey does not belong in the eu because it does n't honor the principles of religious rights , human rights , minority rights , or democratic rule .
finally , it occupies and colonizes an eu member state - cyprus .
m.g. ikossi md , phd just one in favor ...
i am sure turkey belongs in the eu .
maybe not in the short run , but in the long run .
turkey will be a most important eu ally , not only in economic terms but military and other issues as well .
turkey joining the eu is a win-win situation .
they need each other .
izmir , turkey turkey 's recognition of cyprus turkey should not necessarily be required to recognize ' greek ' cyprus as the sole representative of the cypriot government .
this disregards any of the legitimate concerns leading to the 1974 invasion by turkey and also the recent affirmative reunification votes by the turkish cypriots that the greeks rejected .
once cyprus is reunited , then fine , recognition would become a prerequisite .
but not until then .
dave alexander , northern ireland .

is that friendship ?

today , the main streets of the baltic seaport were draped in the red and white of poland , with solidarity logos and huge posters recalling that the wave of strikes across the country in august 1980 - but especially the much-publicized gdansk shipyard strike - were the first brave steps towards ending communism in europe .
graffiti commissioned by the city authorities at one of the entrances to the port remind visitors and residents of the names of key players and events in the heady days of 1980 that led to the birth of the movement .
bildunterschrift : on one wall , an artist paid tribute to anna walentynowicz , the crane operator whose sacking sparked the shipyard strike on august 14 , 1980 .
on another , graffiti depict an underground printing press , where workers published illegal fliers against the communist regime .
spotlight on walesa on yet another , a street artist depicted a huge crowd gathered outside the lenin shipyard in gdansk during the august 1980 strike , as strike leader lech walesa signed an agreement with the communist bosses , giving victory to the workers .
on august 31 , walesa emerged from more than two weeks of talks between the strikers and shipyard bosses , and proclaimed to his fellow workers : " we have free , independent trade unions . "
solidarity , described by walesa as the greatest proletarian monopoly ever and the only movement able to take on communism , was born .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the solidarity logo " every time i come here , my heart does ten to the dozen , " shipyard worker maria wojciechowska told afp outside the gates of the sprawling industrial complex , now a mere skeleton of its glorious past , when poland built ships for the soviets .
the austere perimeter walls were bedecked with flowers on wednesday , a picture of the late pope john paul ii and an effigy of the black madonna of czestochowa .
evoking the pope walesa , a devout catholic , is said to have worn a lapel pin of the black madonna during the shipyard strike , and was close to and inspired by the late polish-born pope , whom he cited in a speech made to both houses of parliament on monday to kick off three days of events to mark solidarity 's creation .
" what changed the face of this land came from us , from our hearts and our souls , " walesa said , paraphrasing a speech pronounced in 1979 by john paul ii on his first pilgrimage to poland .
near the entrance to the shipyard , by a towering monument to polish workers killed by the communist government , some 20 heads of state and government will join dignitaries from around the world and solidarity leaders for a ceremony to mark the occasion . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . after an iatrogenic waterfall caused by the prescribing of two wrong meds together which hospitalized my son , i went to a homeopath -lrb- german born ! -rrb- .
after a 3 hour intake interview , he said the symptoms would be resolved by chelation -lrb- natural food substances -rrb- and homeopathic remedies .
and that it would take about four to five years .
just as he said , my son is well after a lot of hard work on all of our parts .
the illness was ocd -lrb- obsessive-compulsive disorder -rrb- .
tell the amazing randi -lrb- a us illusionist who offered $ 1 million for proof that homeopathy works -rrb- to top that and keep his money where his mouth is . - nora g i have used homeopathy for my child who is five years of age .
he had delayed speech .
he had not spoken till he was three year of age and i was told that homeopathy had a medicine that would make him talk .
today he talks so much that i have to ask him to keep quiet . - niraja after the recent article , lancet 's editorial conclusions about homeopathy defy logic .
are they saying that if someone selected 100 studies that showed no outcome of various allopathic medications that that proves that the whole of regular medicine does n't work ?
it would be easy to find these studies !
such flawed conclusions about homeopathy come from serious bias verging on vindictive prejudice on the researcher 's and lancet 's part . - harold b i think that homeopathy can be an immune stimulator , and it is in that capacity that i have experienced its usefulness - especially as a preventive against rhinovirus .
the question becomes whether the placebo effect is also an immune stimulator in the same way . - elizabeth krause , usa i 've suffered from severe seasonal allergies since childhood .
allopathic medicine was not able to help me - in fact , i developed several side effects from having to take antihistamines , sinus decongestors , etc .
finally i decided to give homeopathy a try .
it worked instantly .
it also began reducing the severity of my allergies from year to year .
i also give homeopathic remedies to my daughter and it works without giving her side effects from the over-the-counter allopathic cold meds .
this is a health system that treats people as individuals , so it would be difficult to replicate it in a lab under controlled conditions where people can not live in their own unique fashion .
does a lab study prove that god exists ?
i do n't really care what the study says , who paid for it and what the motive is .
the bottom line is : it works . - priya alldis thank you for your informative article on homeopathy .
i have n't used it intensively , preferring acupuncture and traditional chinese medicine instead . however , i have used arnica montana , which is a remedy for muscle bruising and soreness , with surprisingly good results . the bruises healed two to three times more quickly with either internal or external doses .
i 've also used a couple of the bach 's flower remedies with success .
these did n't work immediately for me -lrb- except for rescue remedy , which did -rrb- but were noticeably helpful .
for myself , i found that short-term they were mild improvements , but within three weeks or so to have pronounced success . - ana vargas , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study : homeopathy no better than placebo homeopathic treatment is no more effective than a placebo , the dummy substance used in medical trials , according to a study appearing in the british medical weekly , " the lancet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the foreign media 's take on germany ray furlong aktham suliman luke harding yan li election 2005 -pipe- 31.08.2005 derek scally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scally : germans seem beset by " katastrophalismus " since 2000 derek scally has reported from berlin for the " irish times . "
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .

"
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .

in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .

what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .
just think of all the surveys , polls and programs on how depressed the nation is .
it was interesting to see that the visit of the pope had an uplifting effect on the people when he addressed his vaterla n d in its own language .
if anyone can break the gloomy mood in germany it seems it is the pope . ranty islam interviewed derek scally send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .

the growth will likely be accelerated by an expected liberalization in the sports betting market and the soccer world cup in 2006 . german pay-tv channel premiere has placed a huge bet on growth in the gambling sector - and the odds are looking good .
on august 1 , the company started a new channel , premiere win , which will exclusively broadcast betting sports .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premiere pay-tv station recently launched all-betting channel premiere win so far the young channel has shown horse races from around the world , but plans to branch out into other sports - soccer , handball , formula 1 racing - are in the works .
premiere win viewers can go online and place bets with premiere partner betandwin , a private bookmaker .
the move was a natural one for premiere , which broadcasts all the matches of the german bundesliga soccer league live and has the rights to live broadcasts of all 64 world cup matches in 2006 .
all aboard the gravy train " it was just a question of being the first one to get on the train , " said dietrich wüstehoff , head of pr at premiere win .
premiere is just one of many companies looking to take a seat at the betting banquet .
others include the german football league -lrb- dsl -rrb- , commercial tv station rtl and sports channel dsf .
" the german sports betting market is right on the edge of taking off because of the liberalization expected in the near future , " wüstehoff said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gamblers can bet on many combinations - like who will get the first foul currently , state-run german bookmaker oddset has a monopoly on most sports betting , but that is being challenged in the courts , and a hearing is slated for nov .

when the decision comes early next year , it is widely expected to open up the betting market for competition - just in time for the world cup games .
changes afoot in addition to oddset , five other firms hold licenses to operate in germany , including betandwin , whose license dates back to the east german era .
in addition , numerous small bookmaking parlors , whose businesses are incorporated in other countries , have sprung up in germany in recent years .
mostly present in berlin , they operate in a sort of legal grey area .
if the market is opened up , these betting parlors can expect to become completely legitimate .
in that case , industry insiders say , germany 's betting scene will look more like england 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william hill betting office syndicate , london , great britain " we assume that in the long term , 10,000 betting offices will open up in germany , " the european betting association ’ s norbert teufelberger told the internet portal focus money .
the german association of bookmakers has said the market liberalization could create as many as 30,000 jobs .
on the down side , the competition from private betting agencies means a smaller share of the pie for the state-run betting companies , and thus less money flowing into government coffers .
big spenders , big business betting in germany is already big business .
gamblers spent three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- on sports bets alone in 2004 .
that could grow to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.1 billion -rrb- by 2010 , according to a study by munich-based mecn consulting group published in capital magazine .
the same study showed 30 billion euros was spent on other types of gambling , such as internet poker , official numbers picking -lrb- lottery games -rrb- and state-run casinos .
everyone agrees that the advent of internet gambling , which allows punters to place bets without having to get out of their bathrobes , has played a large role in the growth of the industry .
worldwide , surfers spent some 300 billion on internet gambling in 2004 , with all signs pointing to continued rapid growth .

"
room for growth despite the large sums already being spent , a report put out by sport & markt shows there is still a lot of room for growth in the sector .
of the 65 million germans over age 14 , just seven million have placed sports bets , the study showed .
" that ’ s a lot of people , but it leaves a large untapped market , " schröder said .
surprisingly , the recent , much-reported scandal involving soccer referee robert hoyzer - he was involved in a croation gambling ring and fixed several games - has also given sports betting a boost .
" our numbers have leapt since the scandal hit the newspapers , " marcus meyer , marketing chief for betandwin , told the handelsblatt newspaper recently .
" the hoyzer case was a big topic on tv every day last spring .
in the reports , sports betting was explained , " he said .
" now it seems people want to try it for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : formula one racing is a popular betting sport sport & markt 's schröder agrees that in terms of the gambling business , any news can be good news .
" in germany , people are relatively new to sports betting .
wherever they hear about it , it means they might want to try it out , " he said .
one other factor may stand behind the growth in germans ' willingness to plunk down a few euros for a chance at big money : the ailing economy .
" when people are n't doing well , there 's more of a tendency to try and win big , " said schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed what can the world expect post-kyoto ? drastic climate change affects germany opinion : a good beginning , but that 's all europe -pipe- 31.08.2005 opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurricane katrina left a trail of destruction in its wake even as the damage caused by hurricane katrina in the us is assessed , the reason for its brutality is already known - global warming .
it underlines yet again there is no alternative to global climate protection . damages of about $ 30 billion , a large city almost completely evacuated and 70 percent of it under water - hurricane katrina has proved that water and storms are still the worst natural catastrophes .
the southern part of the us is aware of that and has been for a long time .
tropical storms emerging from the warm sea are n't a rarity and the warmer it is , the stronger they are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of moss point , miss . , make their way to safety .
not insignificantly , humans have contributed to this new fury unleashed by global climate change - more concretely , by burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal which in turn release carbon dioxide .
listening to the experts not fashionable climate experts have been saying it for years : it 's not the number of hurricanes that 's increasing but rather their intensity .
but the experts were first ignored by politicians and then mildly snickered at .
at present , their theories are being angrily rejected , even though many of their scenarios are becoming reality , simply because their statements are uncomfortable .
that 's because the experts also explain what mankind can and must do in order to stop the greenhouse effect - in order to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , one needs different energy sources such as wind and sun and more gas instead of coal , more fuel-efficient cars and more energy savings .
all that was popular at the beginning of the 1990s when the world 's nations met in rio de janeiro and agreed on a global environment policy .
the euphoria was heady given that it came about so soon after the fall of the iron curtain .
many things , if not all , seemed possible - even a solution to climate problems .
dashed hopes but much has happened since .
the new economy collapsed , the horrific vision of international terrorism took shape , the economies of leading industrial nations lurched from crisis to crisis and the preservation of the environment slipped from world attention .
the us , which initially helped shape the new global environment policy , shrank back from once concrete steps had to be taken .
bildunterschrift : palm trees are bent from the force of hurricane katrina in an area hit by hurricane ivan last september in the grande lagoon area of pensacola , florida the talks on the kyoto protocol which began on a hopeful note proved to be laborious and tough .
the results are pitiful when compared to the demands .
the treaty , which was sealed in february 2005 , allows worldwide emission levels to stagnate , at the very best .
talk of reducing them has all but evaporated and the us is simply not playing along any more .
the americans love their gas-guzzling pickup trucks and their gigantic refrigerators .
the average us citizen consumes twice the amount of energy than the average european , who in turn consumes much more than an african .
soon , the upcoming asian countries of india and china will ensure that energy consumption will rise drastically .
there 's no doubt that the outlook for the world climate looks gloomy .
no alternative to global climate protection still , there 's no alternative to an international effort for climate policy - the greenhouse effect is hardly restrained by boundaries .
the rich western nations must develop and promote technologies in their own countries that could help stop global warming worldwide .
the industrial nations must develop instruments - emissions trading is one of them - with which they can put a lid on their emissions and then reduce them .
bildunterschrift : floodwaters surround a car in uptown new orleans .
in other words , politicians , in particular us president bush , must realize that climate experts and scientists are n't some kind of doomsday prophets .
their warnings must finally be taken seriously .
environment and climate protection is a question of existence , not one of luxury .
it 's not a matter that politicians only address during good times - when the economy is humming along - as is often the case in germany if this realization does n't set in soon , then we 're going to have to get used to damages in the billions caused by storms , floods , heat and famine - damages that at some point we wo n't be able to pay for . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european cities face future heatwaves a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future .

a new study shows the german trend toward shifting jobs overseas is growing in the r & d sector - but business advocates try to look at the bright side . the poll by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- surveyed 4,400 internationally active companies , including small and medium-sized businesses .
nearly 30 percent of the companies had already moved part of their operations overseas or had plans to do so , the study showed .
for the most part , the companies that planned to shift research and development capacity abroad were those that had moved production there earlier .
businesses cited lower wages abroad , proximity to clients and demands of the marketplace as their reasons for the increased overseas presence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens makes cell phones in brazil only 3 percent of those who had moved production or research facilities abroad would like to bring them back to germany , the study showed .
while the increase in jobs abroad did help keep the german economy afloat , the situation could be much better for germany , said dihk head ludwig-georg braun .
staying positive " the dynamics of foreign economies could have a more positive effect on german jobs if many companies would not opt to move their production and research and development overseas , " braun said .
in an effort to see the positive side of the results , braun noted that the study clearly showed international activity helped keep sales and personnel levels afloat at home .

a new study shows the german trend toward shifting jobs overseas is growing in the r & d sector - but business advocates try to look at the bright side . the poll by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- surveyed 4,400 internationally active companies , including small and medium-sized businesses .
nearly 30 percent of the companies had already moved part of their operations overseas or had plans to do so , the study showed .
for the most part , the companies that planned to shift research and development capacity abroad were those that had moved production there earlier .
businesses cited lower wages abroad , proximity to clients and demands of the marketplace as their reasons for the increased overseas presence .

richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .

" the situation on the oil market is very serious , " he said in berlin on wednesday .
the record oil price , now at over $ 70 per barrel , is " a real catastrophe for people , " he added . the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , georg ludwig braun , said the high oil prices are definitely a damper on germany 's domestic economy , since high prices for heating oil and other petroleum products would take money out of consumers ' wallets that they would normally spend for other purchases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weak consumer spending is often blamed by economists for the continuing weak performance of the german economy .
while exports continue to be robust , the spendthrift ways of german consumers have prevented the economy from taking flight . oil squeeze oil prices have jumped due to fears by traders that oil supplies could be squeezed in the wake of hurricane katrina , which caused several oil platforms in the gulf of mexico to close .
eight refineries in the us south were shut down and the production capacity of two others has been curtailed , meaning a loss of more than ten percent of us refinery capacity . bildunterschrift : the cheveron pascagoula refinery is shown flooded out by the storm surge caused by hurricane katrina in a pascagoula , miss . energy analysts warn it could be weeks before the real consequences of the storm can be assessed . opec said wednesday it would do its utmost to ensure the stability of the global oil market in the wake of the hurricane and would discuss the means at its summit in vienna on september 19-20 . evacuations continue rescuers scrambled buses , boats and helicopters wednesday to evacuate survivors of the catastrophe . new orleans mayor ray nagin said close to a million people had been evacuated from the city and surrounding areas before and after katrina pounded the gulf coast on monday , leaving hundreds feared dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this aerial photo shows the devastation caused by the high winds and heavy flooding in the greater new orleans area following hurricane katrina but he said " a couple hundred thousand " were still trapped with the lake spilling into the low-lying city after an effort to plug a breach in a major levee failed tuesday and pumps gave out . nagin told abc the flooding was not the only concern as he was also worried about bodies in the water .
" at some point in time , the dead bodies are going to start to create a serious disease issue . " surreal landscape the once-bustling southern jazz mecca offered an almost surreal watery landscape wednesday , with the eerie silence punctured only by the whirr of helicopters above and the occasional hum of a electric generator . people scrounging for food and cigarettes streets roamed ever-diminishing areas of dry land , including the famed french quarter .
shops were smashed by looters ; some were gutted by flames . bildunterschrift : new orleans residents walk through floodwaters that besiege the crescent city on tuesday , aug .
30 , 2005 . nagin said the waters flooding into the low-lying city " will rise to try and equal the water level of the lake , which is three feet -lrb- one meter -rrb- above sea level . " that 's significant , because on st. charles avenue , one of our most famous avenues , it is six feet below sea level in elevation .
there will be nine feet in that area , and probably 20 feet in other areas of the city , " he said . nagin said it would be 12 to 16 weeks before residents could return to the city , an assessment echoed by blanco .
" we do n't know the integrity of the buildings , " she said .
" but it is going to be weeks , perhaps months . " " it is a logistical nightmare for us to just bring water and food supplies in .

most readers were opposed asked their opinion on turkey joining the european union , the majority of dw-world readers who answered were staunchly opposed . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
healthy multiculturalism ?
is that what we are seeing in spain , holland , london and germany ?
a yet larger muslim population combined with dismal demographic numbers for european birth rates means visitors to europe will soon need to bring their arabic dictionaries .
this may offend liberal sensibilities but once a culture is swallowed up it will not return .
european culture has been the light of the world -lrb- although not lately -rrb- and it is worth protecting .
and i do n't mean from coca cola .
j.l. ronish we should not forget that a good portion of europe was under the yoke of the ottoman empire -lrb- i.e. , turkey -rrb- for many years .
the turks are of asian nature .
they are muslim and not christian european .
the muslims have been trying to gain control of the rest of europe for centuries .
h. regner unlucky marriage ?
i see the eu-turkish relationship like a couple .
turkey and the eu have been dating for a very long time with promises and commitments along the way .
they made plans to get engaged on oct .
3 .
the question is how will eu administrators tell turkey that its family -lrb- the public -rrb- is opposed to the marriage ?
ersan tasli if turkey is admitted to the eu , it will become the trojan horse of europe .
europe suffers from a catastrophic demographic problem , which has been underestimated by the various socialist-liberal governments .
turkey would be the second most populous eu country .
the greeks would suffer most .
we would disappear off the map .
manolis alifierakis , greece turkey is not part of europe and should not be admitted to the eu .
i realize the us is keen to see turkey join but of course they have their own agenda : the last thing the bush administration wants to see is a strong and independent europe .
an alliance 's strength is measured more by it 's unity than it 's size .
turkey would only weaken europe by it 's presence .
bob rehling , australia turkey does not belong in the eu because it does n't honor the principles of religious rights , human rights , minority rights , or democratic rule .
finally , it occupies and colonizes an eu member state - cyprus .
m.g. ikossi md , phd just one in favor ...
i am sure turkey belongs in the eu .
maybe not in the short run , but in the long run .
turkey will be a most important eu ally , not only in economic terms but military and other issues as well .
turkey joining the eu is a win-win situation .
they need each other .
izmir , turkey turkey 's recognition of cyprus turkey should not necessarily be required to recognize ' greek ' cyprus as the sole representative of the cypriot government .
this disregards any of the legitimate concerns leading to the 1974 invasion by turkey and also the recent affirmative reunification votes by the turkish cypriots that the greeks rejected .
once cyprus is reunited , then fine , recognition would become a prerequisite .
but not until then .
dave alexander , northern ireland .
if the eu is all about friendship and peace , how can it be that turkey does n't even recognize cyprus ?
is that friendship ?
george , cyprus compiled by dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives say no to turkey again in a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the foreign media 's take on germany ray furlong aktham suliman luke harding yan li election 2005 -pipe- 31.08.2005 derek scally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scally : germans seem beset by " katastrophalismus " since 2000 derek scally has reported from berlin for the " irish times . "
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .

gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .

"
ahead of the upcoming general election he gave dw-world his take on the situation in germany and what needs to change . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
derek scally : badly .
but it 's difficult to know how much of this is in the heads of people and how much this is in the economy , say .
yes , there is a demographic problem , there are high taxes , there 's unemployment .
but other countries also have these problems .
there seems to be this " katastrophalismus " - the view that all is bad and getting worse .
the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .

the country does have huge strengths but people do n't see this .
they are constantly talking " down " the country and look to politicians to solve everything , but do n't see they have to pull themselves up .
i think merkel has mentioned this strength and said that it 's up to people themselves to bring it out .
schröder in contrast blames external factors for the bad situation .
the political system makes this problem worse : the structure of the political system means that a course of action once agreed on can not be pushed through without constantly checking back with what the bundesrat -lrb- the upper house representing the federal states ' interests -rrb- or one 's own political party is saying .
merkel and schröder both have this problem with their respective parties .
strength on the part of those in charge is apparently considered dangerous .
what n eeds to happe n to speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
psychologically a change of government will give an important new impulse .
but a new government will be messing around and take one or two years to get their bearings .
on the other hand , if schröder stayed in power , he would benefit from an economy that is picking up now anyway .
whether the parties will get far with their proposals remains to be seen .
the social democrats ' program is a classic case of promising the sun , moon and the stars - a " deckchair on the titanic " sort of program .
meanwhile the tax proposals by the christian democratic opposition have been shut down by friendly fire already .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't see the huge problem with schröder .
he 's a good representative and no huge embarrassment as other leaders , but he 's a showman .
merkel gives people a feeling that she knows what things are about and what needs to be done .
in the end , though , it does n't come down to personality alone .
german politics is so consensual - everything a leader comes up with has to be checked with the party .
and so , i also do n't see why people complain so much about schröder .
i think it 's really because with a strong personality it 's easier to threaten your party .
merkel does n't have the personality to do that .
once the novelty of a frau bu n deska n zler -lrb- madam chancellor -rrb- has worn off , this will gnaw away at her throne .
what do you like about germa n y ?
it 's a country with an incredible strength economically and socially .
in ireland we would n't mind having germany 's " problems . "
ireland is much more unequal than germany is possibly becoming now .
it 's amazing what people in germany can expect when they are being laid off .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
the constant moaning .
when you look at products , services , exports germany no longer occupies a number one position internationally .
but that 's not because the country has been doing worse but rather because in a globalized world , no one is number one any more .
in my opinion , the gloom and doom is also driven by the media .
just think of all the surveys , polls and programs on how depressed the nation is .
it was interesting to see that the visit of the pope had an uplifting effect on the people when he addressed his vaterla n d in its own language .
if anyone can break the gloomy mood in germany it seems it is the pope . ranty islam interviewed derek scally send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germans abuse state system amid continuing protests over benefit cuts , chancellor schröder has sharply criticized his countrymen who he says take more than their fair share of state allowances .
the comments have raised the ire of social groups .
-lrb- sep .

on august 1 , the company started a new channel , premiere win , which will exclusively broadcast betting sports .

premiere win viewers can go online and place bets with premiere partner betandwin , a private bookmaker .
the move was a natural one for premiere , which broadcasts all the matches of the german bundesliga soccer league live and has the rights to live broadcasts of all 64 world cup matches in 2006 .
all aboard the gravy train " it was just a question of being the first one to get on the train , " said dietrich wüstehoff , head of pr at premiere win .
premiere is just one of many companies looking to take a seat at the betting banquet .
others include the german football league -lrb- dsl -rrb- , commercial tv station rtl and sports channel dsf .
" the german sports betting market is right on the edge of taking off because of the liberalization expected in the near future , " wüstehoff said .

in addition , numerous small bookmaking parlors , whose businesses are incorporated in other countries , have sprung up in germany in recent years .
mostly present in berlin , they operate in a sort of legal grey area .
if the market is opened up , these betting parlors can expect to become completely legitimate .
in that case , industry insiders say , germany 's betting scene will look more like england 's .

the german association of bookmakers has said the market liberalization could create as many as 30,000 jobs .
on the down side , the competition from private betting agencies means a smaller share of the pie for the state-run betting companies , and thus less money flowing into government coffers .
big spenders , big business betting in germany is already big business .
gamblers spent three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- on sports bets alone in 2004 .
that could grow to 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.1 billion -rrb- by 2010 , according to a study by munich-based mecn consulting group published in capital magazine .
the same study showed 30 billion euros was spent on other types of gambling , such as internet poker , official numbers picking -lrb- lottery games -rrb- and state-run casinos .
everyone agrees that the advent of internet gambling , which allows punters to place bets without having to get out of their bathrobes , has played a large role in the growth of the industry .

room for growth despite the large sums already being spent , a report put out by sport & markt shows there is still a lot of room for growth in the sector .
of the 65 million germans over age 14 , just seven million have placed sports bets , the study showed .
" that ’ s a lot of people , but it leaves a large untapped market , " schröder said .
surprisingly , the recent , much-reported scandal involving soccer referee robert hoyzer - he was involved in a croation gambling ring and fixed several games - has also given sports betting a boost .
" our numbers have leapt since the scandal hit the newspapers , " marcus meyer , marketing chief for betandwin , told the handelsblatt newspaper recently .
" the hoyzer case was a big topic on tv every day last spring .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
healthy multiculturalism ?
is that what we are seeing in spain , holland , london and germany ?
a yet larger muslim population combined with dismal demographic numbers for european birth rates means visitors to europe will soon need to bring their arabic dictionaries .
this may offend liberal sensibilities but once a culture is swallowed up it will not return .
european culture has been the light of the world -lrb- although not lately -rrb- and it is worth protecting .
and i do n't mean from coca cola .
j.l. ronish we should not forget that a good portion of europe was under the yoke of the ottoman empire -lrb- i.e. , turkey -rrb- for many years .
the turks are of asian nature .
they are muslim and not christian european .
the muslims have been trying to gain control of the rest of europe for centuries .
h. regner unlucky marriage ?
i see the eu-turkish relationship like a couple .
turkey and the eu have been dating for a very long time with promises and commitments along the way .
they made plans to get engaged on oct .
3 .
the question is how will eu administrators tell turkey that its family -lrb- the public -rrb- is opposed to the marriage ?
ersan tasli if turkey is admitted to the eu , it will become the trojan horse of europe .
europe suffers from a catastrophic demographic problem , which has been underestimated by the various socialist-liberal governments .
turkey would be the second most populous eu country .
the greeks would suffer most .
we would disappear off the map .
manolis alifierakis , greece turkey is not part of europe and should not be admitted to the eu .
i realize the us is keen to see turkey join but of course they have their own agenda : the last thing the bush administration wants to see is a strong and independent europe .
an alliance 's strength is measured more by it 's unity than it 's size .
turkey would only weaken europe by it 's presence .
bob rehling , australia turkey does not belong in the eu because it does n't honor the principles of religious rights , human rights , minority rights , or democratic rule .
finally , it occupies and colonizes an eu member state - cyprus .
m.g. ikossi md , phd just one in favor ...
i am sure turkey belongs in the eu .
maybe not in the short run , but in the long run .
turkey will be a most important eu ally , not only in economic terms but military and other issues as well .
turkey joining the eu is a win-win situation .
they need each other .
izmir , turkey turkey 's recognition of cyprus turkey should not necessarily be required to recognize ' greek ' cyprus as the sole representative of the cypriot government .
this disregards any of the legitimate concerns leading to the 1974 invasion by turkey and also the recent affirmative reunification votes by the turkish cypriots that the greeks rejected .
once cyprus is reunited , then fine , recognition would become a prerequisite .
but not until then .
dave alexander , northern ireland .
if the eu is all about friendship and peace , how can it be that turkey does n't even recognize cyprus ?
is that friendship ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed what can the world expect post-kyoto ? drastic climate change affects germany opinion : a good beginning , but that 's all europe -pipe- 31.08.2005 opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurricane katrina left a trail of destruction in its wake even as the damage caused by hurricane katrina in the us is assessed , the reason for its brutality is already known - global warming .
it underlines yet again there is no alternative to global climate protection . damages of about $ 30 billion , a large city almost completely evacuated and 70 percent of it under water - hurricane katrina has proved that water and storms are still the worst natural catastrophes .
the southern part of the us is aware of that and has been for a long time .
tropical storms emerging from the warm sea are n't a rarity and the warmer it is , the stronger they are .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : residents of moss point , miss . , make their way to safety .
not insignificantly , humans have contributed to this new fury unleashed by global climate change - more concretely , by burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal which in turn release carbon dioxide .
listening to the experts not fashionable climate experts have been saying it for years : it 's not the number of hurricanes that 's increasing but rather their intensity .
but the experts were first ignored by politicians and then mildly snickered at .
at present , their theories are being angrily rejected , even though many of their scenarios are becoming reality , simply because their statements are uncomfortable .
that 's because the experts also explain what mankind can and must do in order to stop the greenhouse effect - in order to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , one needs different energy sources such as wind and sun and more gas instead of coal , more fuel-efficient cars and more energy savings .
all that was popular at the beginning of the 1990s when the world 's nations met in rio de janeiro and agreed on a global environment policy .
the euphoria was heady given that it came about so soon after the fall of the iron curtain .
many things , if not all , seemed possible - even a solution to climate problems .
dashed hopes but much has happened since .
the new economy collapsed , the horrific vision of international terrorism took shape , the economies of leading industrial nations lurched from crisis to crisis and the preservation of the environment slipped from world attention .
the us , which initially helped shape the new global environment policy , shrank back from once concrete steps had to be taken .
bildunterschrift : palm trees are bent from the force of hurricane katrina in an area hit by hurricane ivan last september in the grande lagoon area of pensacola , florida the talks on the kyoto protocol which began on a hopeful note proved to be laborious and tough .
the results are pitiful when compared to the demands .
the treaty , which was sealed in february 2005 , allows worldwide emission levels to stagnate , at the very best .
talk of reducing them has all but evaporated and the us is simply not playing along any more .
the americans love their gas-guzzling pickup trucks and their gigantic refrigerators .
the average us citizen consumes twice the amount of energy than the average european , who in turn consumes much more than an african .
soon , the upcoming asian countries of india and china will ensure that energy consumption will rise drastically .
there 's no doubt that the outlook for the world climate looks gloomy .
no alternative to global climate protection still , there 's no alternative to an international effort for climate policy - the greenhouse effect is hardly restrained by boundaries .
the rich western nations must develop and promote technologies in their own countries that could help stop global warming worldwide .
the industrial nations must develop instruments - emissions trading is one of them - with which they can put a lid on their emissions and then reduce them .
bildunterschrift : floodwaters surround a car in uptown new orleans .
in other words , politicians , in particular us president bush , must realize that climate experts and scientists are n't some kind of doomsday prophets .
their warnings must finally be taken seriously .
environment and climate protection is a question of existence , not one of luxury .
it 's not a matter that politicians only address during good times - when the economy is humming along - as is often the case in germany if this realization does n't set in soon , then we 're going to have to get used to damages in the billions caused by storms , floods , heat and famine - damages that at some point we wo n't be able to pay for . jens thurau -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european cities face future heatwaves a new study by the wwf environmental organization shows that temperatures in european cities are on the rise with more extreme weather predicted in the increasingly sticky future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the foreign media 's take on germany ray furlong aktham suliman luke harding yan li election 2005 -pipe- 31.08.2005 richard bernstein großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernstein : " there needs to be more private responsibility " richard bernstein has been covering stories in germany , austria and poland for " the new york times " from berlin since january 2003 .
what does he make of the situation in pre-election germany ? dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .
of course unemployment is a problem , but there may be a bit of a tendency amongst germans to exaggerate the nature of their plight .
from an american standpoint , the social problems seem manageable .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y , to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
one of the striking things about the political mainstream parties , with the exception of the li n kspartei -lsb- the new left party -rsb- is , that they all agree the country badly needs thorough economic reform for germany to become more competitive and to be able to afford itself .
so the debate is not about whether reform is needed but of what kind and how radical .
and there is no doubt that germany has tremendous resources on which to build economic recovery - highly skilled and educated individuals , a good infrastructure , technological knowledge .
but there needs to be more private responsibility .
i would like to see greater development of a non-governmental civic society and a departure from this attitude that the state needs to take care of everything .
i think this is also one of the reasons for the situation of the education system .
the state can no longer finance free for all education .
german universities are still very good but do not compare anymore with the top institutions in the us and britain .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
why ?
i do n't have an answer to that .

what does he make of the situation in pre-election germany ? dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
richard bernstein : for all the bad things you read - about the economy , unemployment - and for someone who has traveled quite a bit in western countries , germany seems a pretty well-ordered troubled country .
of course unemployment is a problem , but there may be a bit of a tendency amongst germans to exaggerate the nature of their plight .
from an american standpoint , the social problems seem manageable .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y , to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
one of the striking things about the political mainstream parties , with the exception of the li n kspartei -lsb- the new left party -rsb- is , that they all agree the country badly needs thorough economic reform for germany to become more competitive and to be able to afford itself .
so the debate is not about whether reform is needed but of what kind and how radical .
and there is no doubt that germany has tremendous resources on which to build economic recovery - highly skilled and educated individuals , a good infrastructure , technological knowledge .
but there needs to be more private responsibility .
i would like to see greater development of a non-governmental civic society and a departure from this attitude that the state needs to take care of everything .
i think this is also one of the reasons for the situation of the education system .
the state can no longer finance free for all education .
german universities are still very good but do not compare anymore with the top institutions in the us and britain .

most readers were opposed asked their opinion on turkey joining the european union , the majority of dw-world readers who answered were staunchly opposed . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
healthy multiculturalism ?
is that what we are seeing in spain , holland , london and germany ?
a yet larger muslim population combined with dismal demographic numbers for european birth rates means visitors to europe will soon need to bring their arabic dictionaries .
this may offend liberal sensibilities but once a culture is swallowed up it will not return .
european culture has been the light of the world -lrb- although not lately -rrb- and it is worth protecting .
and i do n't mean from coca cola .
j.l. ronish we should not forget that a good portion of europe was under the yoke of the ottoman empire -lrb- i.e. , turkey -rrb- for many years .
the turks are of asian nature .
they are muslim and not christian european .
the muslims have been trying to gain control of the rest of europe for centuries .
h. regner unlucky marriage ?
i see the eu-turkish relationship like a couple .
turkey and the eu have been dating for a very long time with promises and commitments along the way .
they made plans to get engaged on oct .
3 .
the question is how will eu administrators tell turkey that its family -lrb- the public -rrb- is opposed to the marriage ?
ersan tasli if turkey is admitted to the eu , it will become the trojan horse of europe .
europe suffers from a catastrophic demographic problem , which has been underestimated by the various socialist-liberal governments .
turkey would be the second most populous eu country .
the greeks would suffer most .
we would disappear off the map .
manolis alifierakis , greece turkey is not part of europe and should not be admitted to the eu .
i realize the us is keen to see turkey join but of course they have their own agenda : the last thing the bush administration wants to see is a strong and independent europe .
an alliance 's strength is measured more by it 's unity than it 's size .
turkey would only weaken europe by it 's presence .
bob rehling , australia turkey does not belong in the eu because it does n't honor the principles of religious rights , human rights , minority rights , or democratic rule .
finally , it occupies and colonizes an eu member state - cyprus .
m.g. ikossi md , phd just one in favor ...
i am sure turkey belongs in the eu .
maybe not in the short run , but in the long run .
turkey will be a most important eu ally , not only in economic terms but military and other issues as well .
turkey joining the eu is a win-win situation .
they need each other .
izmir , turkey turkey 's recognition of cyprus turkey should not necessarily be required to recognize ' greek ' cyprus as the sole representative of the cypriot government .
this disregards any of the legitimate concerns leading to the 1974 invasion by turkey and also the recent affirmative reunification votes by the turkish cypriots that the greeks rejected .
once cyprus is reunited , then fine , recognition would become a prerequisite .
but not until then .
dave alexander , northern ireland .
if the eu is all about friendship and peace , how can it be that turkey does n't even recognize cyprus ?

most readers were opposed asked their opinion on turkey joining the european union , the majority of dw-world readers who answered were staunchly opposed . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
healthy multiculturalism ?
is that what we are seeing in spain , holland , london and germany ?
a yet larger muslim population combined with dismal demographic numbers for european birth rates means visitors to europe will soon need to bring their arabic dictionaries .
this may offend liberal sensibilities but once a culture is swallowed up it will not return .
european culture has been the light of the world -lrb- although not lately -rrb- and it is worth protecting .
and i do n't mean from coca cola .
j.l. ronish we should not forget that a good portion of europe was under the yoke of the ottoman empire -lrb- i.e. , turkey -rrb- for many years .
the turks are of asian nature .
they are muslim and not christian european .
the muslims have been trying to gain control of the rest of europe for centuries .
h. regner unlucky marriage ?
i see the eu-turkish relationship like a couple .
turkey and the eu have been dating for a very long time with promises and commitments along the way .
they made plans to get engaged on oct .
3 .
the question is how will eu administrators tell turkey that its family -lrb- the public -rrb- is opposed to the marriage ?
ersan tasli if turkey is admitted to the eu , it will become the trojan horse of europe .
europe suffers from a catastrophic demographic problem , which has been underestimated by the various socialist-liberal governments .
turkey would be the second most populous eu country .
the greeks would suffer most .
we would disappear off the map .
manolis alifierakis , greece turkey is not part of europe and should not be admitted to the eu .
i realize the us is keen to see turkey join but of course they have their own agenda : the last thing the bush administration wants to see is a strong and independent europe .
an alliance 's strength is measured more by it 's unity than it 's size .
turkey would only weaken europe by it 's presence .
bob rehling , australia turkey does not belong in the eu because it does n't honor the principles of religious rights , human rights , minority rights , or democratic rule .
finally , it occupies and colonizes an eu member state - cyprus .
m.g. ikossi md , phd just one in favor ...
i am sure turkey belongs in the eu .
maybe not in the short run , but in the long run .
turkey will be a most important eu ally , not only in economic terms but military and other issues as well .
turkey joining the eu is a win-win situation .
they need each other .
izmir , turkey turkey 's recognition of cyprus turkey should not necessarily be required to recognize ' greek ' cyprus as the sole representative of the cypriot government .
this disregards any of the legitimate concerns leading to the 1974 invasion by turkey and also the recent affirmative reunification votes by the turkish cypriots that the greeks rejected .
once cyprus is reunited , then fine , recognition would become a prerequisite .
but not until then .
dave alexander , northern ireland .
if the eu is all about friendship and peace , how can it be that turkey does n't even recognize cyprus ?
is that friendship ?
george , cyprus compiled by dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives say no to turkey again in a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .

" what changed the face of this land came from us , from our hearts and our souls , " walesa said , paraphrasing a speech pronounced in 1979 by john paul ii on his first pilgrimage to poland .

a new study shows the german trend toward shifting jobs overseas is growing in the r & d sector - but business advocates try to look at the bright side . the poll by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- surveyed 4,400 internationally active companies , including small and medium-sized businesses .
nearly 30 percent of the companies had already moved part of their operations overseas or had plans to do so , the study showed .
for the most part , the companies that planned to shift research and development capacity abroad were those that had moved production there earlier .
businesses cited lower wages abroad , proximity to clients and demands of the marketplace as their reasons for the increased overseas presence .

while the increase in jobs abroad did help keep the german economy afloat , the situation could be much better for germany , said dihk head ludwig-georg braun .
staying positive " the dynamics of foreign economies could have a more positive effect on german jobs if many companies would not opt to move their production and research and development overseas , " braun said .
in an effort to see the positive side of the results , braun noted that the study clearly showed international activity helped keep sales and personnel levels afloat at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish launderers clean linens for berlin hotels according to the report , 55 percent of the companies polled had improved sales as a result of their move .
some 37 percent of respondents said that since moving some activities overseas , they had been able to expand within germany .
another 22 percent said they had laid off personnel .
the more companies moved production abroad , however , the more they would consider moving research and development jobs as well , braun warned .

a new study shows the german trend toward shifting jobs overseas is growing in the r & d sector - but business advocates try to look at the bright side . the poll by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- surveyed 4,400 internationally active companies , including small and medium-sized businesses .
nearly 30 percent of the companies had already moved part of their operations overseas or had plans to do so , the study showed .
for the most part , the companies that planned to shift research and development capacity abroad were those that had moved production there earlier .
businesses cited lower wages abroad , proximity to clients and demands of the marketplace as their reasons for the increased overseas presence .

most readers were opposed asked their opinion on turkey joining the european union , the majority of dw-world readers who answered were staunchly opposed . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
healthy multiculturalism ?
is that what we are seeing in spain , holland , london and germany ?
a yet larger muslim population combined with dismal demographic numbers for european birth rates means visitors to europe will soon need to bring their arabic dictionaries .
this may offend liberal sensibilities but once a culture is swallowed up it will not return .
european culture has been the light of the world -lrb- although not lately -rrb- and it is worth protecting .
and i do n't mean from coca cola .
j.l. ronish we should not forget that a good portion of europe was under the yoke of the ottoman empire -lrb- i.e. , turkey -rrb- for many years .
the turks are of asian nature .
they are muslim and not christian european .
the muslims have been trying to gain control of the rest of europe for centuries .
h. regner unlucky marriage ?
i see the eu-turkish relationship like a couple .
turkey and the eu have been dating for a very long time with promises and commitments along the way .
they made plans to get engaged on oct .
3 .
the question is how will eu administrators tell turkey that its family -lrb- the public -rrb- is opposed to the marriage ?
ersan tasli if turkey is admitted to the eu , it will become the trojan horse of europe .
europe suffers from a catastrophic demographic problem , which has been underestimated by the various socialist-liberal governments .
turkey would be the second most populous eu country .
the greeks would suffer most .
we would disappear off the map .
manolis alifierakis , greece turkey is not part of europe and should not be admitted to the eu .
i realize the us is keen to see turkey join but of course they have their own agenda : the last thing the bush administration wants to see is a strong and independent europe .
an alliance 's strength is measured more by it 's unity than it 's size .
turkey would only weaken europe by it 's presence .
bob rehling , australia turkey does not belong in the eu because it does n't honor the principles of religious rights , human rights , minority rights , or democratic rule .
finally , it occupies and colonizes an eu member state - cyprus .
m.g. ikossi md , phd just one in favor ...
i am sure turkey belongs in the eu .
maybe not in the short run , but in the long run .
turkey will be a most important eu ally , not only in economic terms but military and other issues as well .
turkey joining the eu is a win-win situation .
they need each other .
izmir , turkey turkey 's recognition of cyprus turkey should not necessarily be required to recognize ' greek ' cyprus as the sole representative of the cypriot government .
this disregards any of the legitimate concerns leading to the 1974 invasion by turkey and also the recent affirmative reunification votes by the turkish cypriots that the greeks rejected .
once cyprus is reunited , then fine , recognition would become a prerequisite .
but not until then .
dave alexander , northern ireland .
if the eu is all about friendship and peace , how can it be that turkey does n't even recognize cyprus ?
is that friendship ?
george , cyprus compiled by dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives say no to turkey again in a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .
-lrb- aug .
26 , 2005 -rrb- feedback what do you think ?
should turkey join the eu ?

are they saying that if someone selected 100 studies that showed no outcome of various allopathic medications that that proves that the whole of regular medicine does n't work ?

allopathic medicine was not able to help me - in fact , i developed several side effects from having to take antihistamines , sinus decongestors , etc .

it worked instantly .
it also began reducing the severity of my allergies from year to year .
i also give homeopathic remedies to my daughter and it works without giving her side effects from the over-the-counter allopathic cold meds .
this is a health system that treats people as individuals , so it would be difficult to replicate it in a lab under controlled conditions where people can not live in their own unique fashion .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
healthy multiculturalism ?
is that what we are seeing in spain , holland , london and germany ?
a yet larger muslim population combined with dismal demographic numbers for european birth rates means visitors to europe will soon need to bring their arabic dictionaries .
this may offend liberal sensibilities but once a culture is swallowed up it will not return .
european culture has been the light of the world -lrb- although not lately -rrb- and it is worth protecting .
and i do n't mean from coca cola .
j.l. ronish we should not forget that a good portion of europe was under the yoke of the ottoman empire -lrb- i.e. , turkey -rrb- for many years .
the turks are of asian nature .
they are muslim and not christian european .
the muslims have been trying to gain control of the rest of europe for centuries .
h. regner unlucky marriage ?
i see the eu-turkish relationship like a couple .
turkey and the eu have been dating for a very long time with promises and commitments along the way .
they made plans to get engaged on oct .
3 .
the question is how will eu administrators tell turkey that its family -lrb- the public -rrb- is opposed to the marriage ?
ersan tasli if turkey is admitted to the eu , it will become the trojan horse of europe .
europe suffers from a catastrophic demographic problem , which has been underestimated by the various socialist-liberal governments .
turkey would be the second most populous eu country .
the greeks would suffer most .
we would disappear off the map .
manolis alifierakis , greece turkey is not part of europe and should not be admitted to the eu .
i realize the us is keen to see turkey join but of course they have their own agenda : the last thing the bush administration wants to see is a strong and independent europe .
an alliance 's strength is measured more by it 's unity than it 's size .
turkey would only weaken europe by it 's presence .
bob rehling , australia turkey does not belong in the eu because it does n't honor the principles of religious rights , human rights , minority rights , or democratic rule .
finally , it occupies and colonizes an eu member state - cyprus .
m.g. ikossi md , phd just one in favor ...
i am sure turkey belongs in the eu .
maybe not in the short run , but in the long run .
turkey will be a most important eu ally , not only in economic terms but military and other issues as well .
turkey joining the eu is a win-win situation .
they need each other .
izmir , turkey turkey 's recognition of cyprus turkey should not necessarily be required to recognize ' greek ' cyprus as the sole representative of the cypriot government .
this disregards any of the legitimate concerns leading to the 1974 invasion by turkey and also the recent affirmative reunification votes by the turkish cypriots that the greeks rejected .
once cyprus is reunited , then fine , recognition would become a prerequisite .
but not until then .
dave alexander , northern ireland .
if the eu is all about friendship and peace , how can it be that turkey does n't even recognize cyprus ?
is that friendship ?

the record oil price , now at over $ 70 per barrel , is " a real catastrophe for people , " he added . the president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , georg ludwig braun , said the high oil prices are definitely a damper on germany 's domestic economy , since high prices for heating oil and other petroleum products would take money out of consumers ' wallets that they would normally spend for other purchases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weak consumer spending is often blamed by economists for the continuing weak performance of the german economy .

reports of abuse in the home increased by 6.5 % in april , may and june , compared with the same period in 2004 .
but officials said they were encouraged by a drop in repeat offences , which fell from almost one in three cases to one in eight , among the uk 's lowest .
the figures come as a new service is launched in cardiff to help gay and lesbian victims of domestic violence .
experts said research showed that violence was at similar levels in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships . "
we ca n't hide behind these terrible facts and are committed to helping reduce the number of domestic violence cases and repeat victimisation " christopher woolley , south wales criminal justice board they said the new same-sex service was needed to deal with the specific needs of gay people , such as real or perceived worries about homophobia .
the figures for domestic violence in south wales were released by the south wales criminal justice board .
almost 4,200 people were victims during spring and early summer , compared with 3,957 in the same period in 2004 .
" it is a fact that with the hot weather the alcohol is flowing , " said christopher woolley , chair of the board and chief crown prosecutor for south wales .
" alcohol affects people in different ways and some people become very violent .
" most of the time it is behind closed doors when there is nobody else around , but we ca n't hide behind these terrible facts . "
sporting events research suggests that one in four women will at some time experience domestic violence , with sporting events and drink factors in half of all cases .
domestic violence is also said to be the crime least likely to be reported .
it is estimated that a woman will typically suffer 35 incidents before telling police . "
south wales police have officers specifically trained in gay and lesbian issues , including hate crime reporting " jane lalljee , cardiff-wales lesbian and gay mardi gras mr woolley said that , because the crown prosecution service relied on witnesses giving evidence , it concentrated on " empowering victims so more will come forward " .
meanwhile , the new strategy for people in lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender relationships is being funded by the cardiff community safety partnership .
it will build on work carried out by the cardiff women 's safety unit , and the dyn project -lrb- for men -rrb- .
james rowlands , of the dyn project , said it was known that one in four members of these communities would experience domestic abuse at some point .
a publicity campaign is being used to promote the scheme , which will peak at the cardiff-wales lesbian and gay mardi gras on 10 september .
jane lalljee , co-chair of the mardi gras committee , said : " south wales police , who have a big presence on site this year with a mobile police station , have officers specifically trained in gay and lesbian issues including hate crime reporting .
" we hope that mardi gras and the dyn project and women 's safety unit can raise awareness of all the issues involved in reporting crimes of this nature . "

the deputy prime minister john prescott has said the plans are necessary if more people are to own their own homes .
more than 120,000 new homes are to be built in kent alone over the next 20 years but mr prescott is concerned the process is too slow and too expensive .
but environmentalists are worried green fields will be built on to meet demand .
urban regeneration the office of the deputy prime minister has already told local authorities they need to make land " available more swiftly " for house building .
it has also admitted its plans could lead to more green fields being built on but said the changes are necessary if the housing shortage is to be tackled and first time buyers are to get on the ladder .
we 're very , very concerned about these proposals dr hilary newport , campaign to protect rural england but dr hilary newport , director of the campaign to protect rural england -lrb- cpre -rrb- , said there were areas of the south east that need new houses more than others .
" the plans suggest that if developers are given large amounts of building land in areas of high house prices , an increase in supply will bring down the price , " said dr newport .
" but it 's areas which tend to have low prices such as run-down parts of towns , which are crying out for regeneration . "
the cpre also fears brownfield sites would be overlooked in favour of greenfield sites because they would be easier to develop .
" a failure to concentrate on urban regeneration and previously used land would be disastrous for kent because yet more beautiful countryside would be destroyed , " dr newport said .
" these proposals are for a really radical shake-up of the planning system and we 're very , very concerned about them .
" the planning system for a long time now has really protected this small and crowded countryside from some of the worst excesses of development .
these proposals could turn that on its head . "
a consultation period for the proposals has been launched .

the report warns the uk and irish marine environment could see changes , with a deepening decline in cod and threats to sea bird colonies .
pollution and reduced food could accelerate the decline of the harbour porpoise , a common sight off the east antrim coast and the foyle estuary .
malachy campbell of wwf ni said the seas were under " severe pressure " .
" this report shows that climate change has the power to deepen this crisis , disrupting and changing the entire ecosystem , " he said .
the report - climate change : plunging our seas into deeper crisis - said an increase in sea surface temperature will be a major factor in further disrupting the breeding , feeding and growing cycles of fish , and in turn sea birds and mammals .
storms changes in the distribution , seasonality and growth , of plankton - the foundation of the marine food chain - will hit many species including cod , in addition to the existing pressures from fisheries , according to the report .
the report also found that major storm surges will have destructive impacts on coastal areas as they become more frequent .
sea level rise is also likely to reduce available coastal habitats of sea birds through erosion and damage to nesting sites .
sand eels , a major food source for birds and fish , which breed in shallow sand banks , may also be affected .
mr campbell said urgent action needed to be taken on climate change and marine initiatives .
" as an island , both issues are extremely important yet there is currently no long term integrated northern ireland strategy to adequately deal with either of these issue , " he said .
" our seas are one of our most important resources and it is vital that new legislation in the form of a marine bill is introduced , which will better protect our marine wildlife and reform the way our seas are planned and managed to ensure they are economically productive and sustainable for future generations .

sea level rise is also likely to reduce available coastal habitats of sea birds through erosion and damage to nesting sites .

several independent companies - such as vonage and skype - already allow computer users to call normal phones around the world using internet telephony at rates of a few pennies a minute .
instant-messaging yahoo is also in the process of introducing such a system , after it bought internet phone company dialpad two months ago .
microsoft currently uses voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- technology in a number of its products , including its instant-messaging service .
the us software firm said it planned to incorporate california-based teleo 's telephone service into its instant messaging service .

morrison began his music career in belfast at the age of 15 fellow belfast crooner brian kennedy said van 's songs " moved " him .
" the songs just really speak ; they reach out of the speakers and put their arms around you and very simply sum up how you feel yourself , " he said .
" his songs have the habit of turning up just when you need them - they 're so reassuring .
" sadness is never very far away , but there 's also something very uplifting about it .
he 's been the soundtrack to many , many people 's lives and particularly , at poignant times in their lives . "
irish singer sinead o 'connor said van 's astral weeks ' album was the " best record ever in the history of the world " .
" i 'm so jealous that it was n't me that made it , as i 'm sure everyone is .
i 've probably bought about 15 copies of it and played it out . "
affectionately known as van the man , morrison left school at 15 to join local r & b band the monarchs , touring throughout europe before returning to form his own group , them .
they scored two notable uk top 10 hit singles with baby please do n't go and here comes the night but disbanded in 1966 .
within months the singer had returned to new york at the prompting of producer bert berns .
their partnership resulted in brown eyed girl .
sinead o 'connor said astral weeks was best album ever londonderry pianist phil coulter said morrison 's work would have a place in any hall of fame .
" he is one of the giants to have emerged , in popular music , in this or in any other generation .
" people like ray charles and john lee hooker have regarded van as being in the same league and in the same game as themselves .
that in itself says it all . "
mike mills of rem said : " van 's still the man . "

the conservation charity wwf said environmental changes would lead to more storms on the west coast and disruption to the food chain .
the report suggested major changes were on the way , with oceans becoming more acidic , plankton shifting and storm-driven floods more frequent .
wwf said the changes would affect fish , sea birds , dolphins and porpoises .
the report found the rise in frequency of major storm surges could wreak havoc on west coast communities , similar to storms which hit the western isles in january . "
storms , as well as sea level rise , are going to be the serious problem for coastal communities " richard dixon wwf scotland it said a rise in sea temperature , which has already increased about a degree in surface temperature , was also likely to disrupt the breeding , feeding and growing cycles of fish and sea birds .
dolphins and porpoises were identified as being under threat from chemical pollution and a reduced food supply .
wwf scotland 's director richard dixon said reducing carbon dioxide emissions was the only way to prevent climate chaos and called on scottish ministers to take action .
he told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " climate change is n't just about the temperature going up , it 's about the whole thing becoming much more unpredictable .
" that means we 'll find it much harder to get on in the ways that we have , we 'll certainly find it much harder to have regular fish stocks , we 'll find it harder for the sea birds , which will have a knock on effect for wildlife tourism .
" storms , as well as sea level rise , are going to be the serious problem for coastal communities and not just in the west and the islands . "
he said there were about 90,000 homes close to sea level around the coast which the government has identified as at risk , including areas along the clyde , forth and tay .
green party environment spokesman mark ruskell accused ministers of burying their heads in the sand .
he said : " in particular , their obsession with building more major roads and boosting gdp at any cost means that ultimately they are failing to protect scottish communities , homes , businesses and the environment from the devastating impacts of climate change . "

just two days ago , mr brogden stepped down as leader of the liberal party in new south wales , after calling an opponent 's wife a " mail order bride " .
he was taken to hospital after being found unconscious with self-inflicted stab wounds in his office late tuesday .
the case has outraged many australians , who accuse the media of putting mr brogden under too much pressure .
federal health minister tony abbott called the press coverage of the incident " ruthless " .
peter debnam , the man tipped to take his place as liberal leader in new south wales , said journalists had not stopped their criticism of mr brogden , despite his resignation and apologies to the people he had offended .
mr brogden has now been discharged from hospital , but the ballot to replace him as party leader is likely to be postponed until friday , with members of the party expected to be too upset to continue with the vote .
apology john brogden stepped down on monday , after apologising for insulting the wife of former state premier bob carr .
bob carr , pictured with his wife helena , said he forgave mr brogden he admitted having had a few drinks on the night he made the offending comments - at a party to celebrate mr carr 's recent departure from office - but denied being drunk .
at the same function , he also pinched the bottom of a female journalist and propositioned another .
" i acted dishonourably and now is the time to act honourably , " he told reporters as he announced his resignation .
before the incident , mr brogden had been tipped as a likely successor to mr carr in the next state elections .
bob carr said on wednesday that he and his wife had forgiven mr brogden and sent him their best wishes .
" let 's get on with it , let him rebuild his life - he 's got a big role as a citizen and as a father and husband , " mr carr told reporters .

the 7,000 mines affected will need to meet national safety standards before they can reopen , state media report .
more than 3,000 miners have been killed this year alone , in fires , floods and other work-related accidents .
analysts say the closures may be hard to enforce , as jobs and energy needs can take precedence over safety .
many of the mines are unlicensed and unregulated , but often when these have been shut down in the past , they have reopened almost immediately , as local officials and mine owners are anxious for their revenue .
official figures show china has around 24,000 coal mines , meeting about 70 % of the country 's annual energy demands .
the crackdown comes two days after rescuers called off the search for scores of miners trapped in a flooded pit in southern china since early august .
the death toll from that disaster now stands at 123 .
job losses the state administration of coal mine safety has already published a list of 1,324 mines earmarked for closure . "
those in private and small mines will lose their jobs and their families will become poorer " li wenge coal industry official about 5,700 others have been told to suspend production by the end of the year .
it is unclear how many miners might lose their jobs , the china daily newspaper reported .
but li wenge , from the coal industry group of shaanxi province , conceded that a lot of people would be affected .
" those in private and small mines will lose their jobs and their families will become poorer , " he told the china daily .
but he added that coal supplies were unlikely to be seriously affected by the shutdown , because most the pits being closed were relatively small .
more than 2,700 miners were killed in disasters in the first half of this year , and another 700 died or were missing in the six weeks up to 15 august , xinhua news agency reported .
but independent estimates say the real figure could be much higher , as mine owners often falsify death counts to avoid closures and fines .
many of the accidents have been blamed on a lack of fire-control and ventilation equipment , or failure to enforce safety regulations .
along with shutting mines , the government is also cracking down on collusion between local officials and mine owners , the china daily said .

li yang , a software engineer from beijing , says the rules will not affect the addicts . "
i think i am addicted .
i 've got to the stage where i feel that without gaming , i have nothing interesting to do .
on weekdays , i game for about five to seven hours a day and in the weekends i will spend 15 hours a day gaming online .
i once spent 48 hours in one go at a game .
it 's crazy , i know .
i was at university then and full of energy .
sometimes i get no sleep .
ever since i started playing , my physical condition has deteriorated .
i get a lot of colds as i do n't really exercise .
but playing games online means that other people are playing live with you .
you work as a team and it gives you a unique sense of responsibility .
it 's a little society .
gaming is a serious problem in china .
many students skip school to go to internet cafes .
some of these places are huge and the atmosphere is smoky .
many people found in these places have problems with communication in the real world .
i have mixed feelings about the curbs .
they might help me find different ways of passing the time .
but you can get around the rules .
when my time is up playing as one character , i can just continue playing as another character .
so these rules wo n't affect the addicts . "
brandon hipsher , who lives in indiana , says that gaming is no more addictive than watching television . "
i am not comfortable with the term " addict " for online games .
there are people who spend five or six hours a day watching television .
why is gaming considered addictive when other activities are not ?
on weekdays i spend about four or five hours a day gaming .
on weekends it ranges from a couple of hours to 15 or 16 hours a day .
gaming helps me escape from whatever happens to be bothering me .
it 's a great stress reliever , a safe outlet to pursue some of my more aggressive tendencies .
one of the names i use online is " shiva " - the powerful indian god of destruction .
but it 's also really sociable .
i live in a small town and gaming is a way to interact with and meet people from all over the world .
i have met players from sweden , australia and korea .
i 've now heard a lot of opinions i would not normally have had access to .
i know how people from around the world view the us .
perhaps this is what is behind china 's new rules .
the average chinese citizen might have less access to other viewpoints and cultures than i do .
perhaps the freedom of an online gaming environment is a challenge .
the rules seem to be another way of the government trying to dictate to the people .
gaming is such a positive experience and it 's a lot of fun .
not enough people make fun a priority in their lives .
gaming lets me make it one . "
sylvia from beijing has now quit gaming , but says that role-playing games made her the centre of a virtual universe . "
i started gaming seriously when i was at university in beijing and i got my first computer .
i became fascinated with role-play games set in the heroic kung fu era .
i always played the part of a boy who would meet powerful gods and beautiful women .
it 's like watching a movie , but you are participating in it .
i really took the emotions on .
i played endlessly only stopping to sleep or eat .
it affected my studies .
i never went to class and i did n't even get to know my teachers .
games help you avoid thinking about the problems of life .
sometimes when you make friends in real life it is not as easy as when you are online , playing in one team .
gaming helps you fulfil a fantasy of what you think you should be .
you are the centre of this virtual world .
but i have quit playing now because i wanted to be the centre of a real world .
i think people who play games are innocents of a sort - they lack any cynicism .
i came to realise that in real life there is no black and white .
you ca n't actually advance just because you are powerful .
people can dislike you for no reason .
there are no gods and dragons to slay .
life is just not that simple . "
naveed khan from london says that gaming can be as serious an addiction as alcoholism . "
i 'd get withdrawal symptoms within five minutes of leaving the game .
i 'd only leave for a drink but i 'd run back to my machine .
i was having my breakfast right in front of the computer .
at work i 'd visit online forums about the game .
i 'm playing less now .
my wife is pregnant and needs a lot of attention .
it would n't look good if i put my energy into world of warcraft .
but i have one message for people who say gamers do n't have a life .
i would just invite them to play for a few days and then try to pull themselves away .
i call the experience a virtual drop .
you just sink and sink .
but you ca n't deny the buzz .
in a game like world of warcraft you spend a lot of time acquiring certain items that give you points and kudos .
those who do well achieve a celebrity-like status in the game with other players who are online too .
it 's a real power trip .
and it 's difficult to let go .
it 's potentially never-ending .
there 's always another quest and the makers are always updating the game adding new levels .
i think the chinese government rules are very good .
some people need to be compelled to stop .
it 's like alcoholism .
if people knew they would become an alcoholic , would they still make that first step ?
i think not . "

li : i once spent 48 hours in one go at a game li yang , a software engineer from beijing , says the rules will not affect the addicts .
i think i am addicted .
i 've got to the stage where i feel that without gaming , i have nothing interesting to do .
on weekdays , i game for about five to seven hours a day and in the weekends i will spend 15 hours a day gaming online .
i once spent 48 hours in one go at a game .
it 's crazy , i know .
i was at university then and full of energy .
sometimes i get no sleep .
ever since i started playing , my physical condition has deteriorated .
i get a lot of colds as i do n't really exercise .
but playing games online means that other people are playing live with you .
you work as a team and it gives you a unique sense of responsibility .
it 's a little society .
gaming is a serious problem in china .
many students skip school to go to internet cafes .
some of these places are huge and the atmosphere is smoky .
many people found in these places have problems with communication in the real world .
i have mixed feelings about the curbs .
they might help me find different ways of passing the time .
but you can get around the rules .
when my time is up playing as one character , i can just continue playing as another character .
so these rules wo n't affect the addicts .
brandon hipsher says he interacts with people around the world brandon hipsher , who lives in indiana , says that gaming is no more addictive than watching television .
i am not comfortable with the term " addict " for online games .
there are people who spend five or six hours a day watching television .
why is gaming considered addictive when other activities are not ?
on weekdays i spend about four or five hours a day gaming .
on weekends it ranges from a couple of hours to 15 or 16 hours a day .
gaming helps me escape from whatever happens to be bothering me .
it 's a great stress reliever , a safe outlet to pursue some of my more aggressive tendencies .
one of the names i use online is " shiva " - the powerful indian god of destruction .
but it 's also really sociable .
i live in a small town and gaming is a way to interact with and meet people from all over the world .
i have met players from sweden , australia and korea .
i 've now heard a lot of opinions i would not normally have had access to .
i know how people from around the world view the us .
perhaps this is what is behind china 's new rules .
the average chinese citizen might have less access to other viewpoints and cultures than i do .
perhaps the freedom of an online gaming environment is a challenge .
the rules seem to be another way of the government trying to dictate to the people .
gaming is such a positive experience and it 's a lot of fun .
not enough people make fun a priority in their lives .
gaming lets me make it one .
