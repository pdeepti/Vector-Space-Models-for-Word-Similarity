the tax would be voluntary or obligatory depending on the country . " we have an agreement to introduce voluntary contributions on air tickets , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker during a break in talks he was chairing among finance ministers from the 25 eu member states . but even as he made the announcement , there appeared to be some confusion lingering as to how the tax would work , as well as some dissenting voices among the gathered ministers . austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , for example , attacked the idea as being unfair for consumers and said that austria would not take part .
but according to the belgian minister , the financial burden for air passengers would be small . " this contribution could be one or two euros at the departure of flights , " didier reynders of belgium said after the meeting . compulsory in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new tax would apply to tickets issues in germany the tax would be compulsory in some countries such as belgium , france and germany while other countries such as malta , cyprus and ireland would give passengers the choice of paying the tax . however , the ministers gave up on another idea to tax jet fuel after it won the support of only a small minority . the european union 's executive commission is to hammer out the details of the airline ticket tax ahead of the ministers ' next meeting set for june 7 . german chancellor gerhard schröder backed the ticket tax scheme after it was first floated by french president jacques chirac , seeking a way for rich nations to increase aid to africa and the developing world . according to a document drawn up for the ministers ' meeting in luxembourg , a tax on airplane tickets would be " relatively simple to implement on a flat rate basis on all flights and have no significant evasion / avoidance problems . " it estimated that a tax of 10 euros -lrb- $ 12.60 -rrb- on eu flights and 30 euros on international flights outside the eu would raise six billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- per year .
no figure was agreed in luxembourg , and it appears that the tax would be much smaller than 10 euros . aid proposals due in september eu finance ministers are studying ways of increasing development aid in order to have a package of proposals that can be put forward at a un summit in september . the ministers also broadly agreed to a proposal from the european commission that eu countries should aim to increase development aid to the equivalent of 0.56 percent of gross national income by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 . " most important is that we got a consensus on objectives that were the proposal of the commission to go to 0.56 percent in 2010 and 0.7 percent in 2015 .
this is very important , " austrian minister grasser said after the meeting . the ministers are struggling to find ways to meet the so-called un millennium development goals , which were set in 2000 and aim in particular to slash global poverty in half by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

the charge was that scientists there were in fact " cross-pollinating " animal species . but stefan treue , the director of the center said the experiments have nothing to do with chimaera , as human cells in monkey 's brains can not release any human characteristics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned embryos in fact , the development of chimera , organisms with two or more genetically distinct types of cells , has nothing to do with either stem cell research .

a new creature then develops out of different genetic characteristics . stem cell specialization researchers at the german primate center and the max-planck institute for biophysical chemistry work in a completely different way .
they have manipulated embryonic human stem cells in test-tubes , teaching them to specialize in the production of the nerve cells which are killed off with the onset of parkinson 's . the question is whether these cells , which would enter the body through an injection into the human brain , can take over the function of the destroyed nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experimenting on rodents is just the first step experiments in which stem cells from mices ' brains were implanted into rats ' brains showed that the transplants in fact caused tumors .

experiments are currently being performed on rats , and if they prove successful in preventing the growth of tumors in rats ' brains , the experiment will be extended to monkeys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one experimental step before humans but getting permission to do so is not always easy . " it has to be a very important issue to be able to justify the animal 's potential suffering , " stefan treue said .

in addition , there was a plan to create a joint commando to secure the efficiency of the pact , in other words , a contract between equal partners . just an illusion but it did n't work out that way . the eastern alliance provoked the cold war , with an arms race spanning decades and new threats between east and west . the soviet union became the dominant military force in central and eastern europe , with the position of chief commander of the so-called " united forces " always going to moscow-based soviet officers . ten thousand russian troops were stationed in the warsaw pact countries , with 350,000 in the gdr alone . the pact suffered its first endurance test in 1956 when hungarians demonstrated for an end to stalinism .

in addition , there was a plan to create a joint commando to secure the efficiency of the pact , in other words , a contract between equal partners . just an illusion but it did n't work out that way . the eastern alliance provoked the cold war , with an arms race spanning decades and new threats between east and west . the soviet union became the dominant military force in central and eastern europe , with the position of chief commander of the so-called " united forces " always going to moscow-based soviet officers . ten thousand russian troops were stationed in the warsaw pact countries , with 350,000 in the gdr alone . the pact suffered its first endurance test in 1956 when hungarians demonstrated for an end to stalinism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.05.2005 german painter provokes with " aryan art " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky 's blond boys german painter norbert bisky has been criticized for toying with the aestheticism of fascism .
but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany . " bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin . " strange and familiar , eerie and cheerful at once , bisky 's paintings speak the language of an ideology that 's as omnipresent and invisible : a claritin realism for a claritin age , " he said . the exhibition runs through may 29 and is open wednesdays through sundays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. torsten gellner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

the charge was that scientists there were in fact " cross-pollinating " animal species . but stefan treue , the director of the center said the experiments have nothing to do with chimaera , as human cells in monkey 's brains can not release any human characteristics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned embryos in fact , the development of chimera , organisms with two or more genetically distinct types of cells , has nothing to do with either stem cell research .
chimera are conceived through the injection of undifferentiated stem cells from the seed of one animal into the early embryo of another animal type .
a new creature then develops out of different genetic characteristics . stem cell specialization researchers at the german primate center and the max-planck institute for biophysical chemistry work in a completely different way .
they have manipulated embryonic human stem cells in test-tubes , teaching them to specialize in the production of the nerve cells which are killed off with the onset of parkinson 's . the question is whether these cells , which would enter the body through an injection into the human brain , can take over the function of the destroyed nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experimenting on rodents is just the first step experiments in which stem cells from mices ' brains were implanted into rats ' brains showed that the transplants in fact caused tumors .
the same thing happened to a particular breed of monkey which received injections of human stem cells into its brain . cancer cell killers at the moment scientists at the max-planck institute for biophysical chemistry are researching what is known as a " terminatorgen " , which kills off cancer cells as they are created .
experiments are currently being performed on rats , and if they prove successful in preventing the growth of tumors in rats ' brains , the experiment will be extended to monkeys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one experimental step before humans but getting permission to do so is not always easy . " it has to be a very important issue to be able to justify the animal 's potential suffering , " stefan treue said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.05.2005 looking back on the warsaw pact saturday marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the warsaw pact , the military alliance between europe 's eastern bloc nations which underpinned the division between east and west . a couple of days after west germany joined nato , which automatically implied rearmament , heads of government from poland , the soviet union , czechoslovakia , hungary , east germany , rumania and albania signed the warsaw pact . this military power pot was to be the european communist bloc 's answer to the north atlantic treaty organisation , but was also intended as a pact of friendship , co-operation and mutual support . then gdr president otto grotewohl saw the pact as a clear response to west germany joining nato and pledged to secure peace and to provide military support in the case of an attack on one or several of the signatory states to the warsaw alliance .
in addition , there was a plan to create a joint commando to secure the efficiency of the pact , in other words , a contract between equal partners . just an illusion but it did n't work out that way . the eastern alliance provoked the cold war , with an arms race spanning decades and new threats between east and west . the soviet union became the dominant military force in central and eastern europe , with the position of chief commander of the so-called " united forces " always going to moscow-based soviet officers . ten thousand russian troops were stationed in the warsaw pact countries , with 350,000 in the gdr alone . the pact suffered its first endurance test in 1956 when hungarians demonstrated for an end to stalinism .
weeks of protest led the government to promises of a multi-party system , democracy and freedom of thought . crushing liberty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grave of hungarian premier imre nagy , in a budapest cemetery in october , 1995 .
but russia was not going to take the change lightly , and at the start of november in 1956 , russian tanks rolled into the capital , budapest , where two days of bloody fighting ensued . three thousand people were killed in the uprising , then prime minister imre nagy was dismissed and arrested by the kgb before being sentenced to death in a mock trial .
two years later he , and 239 others involved in the revolution , were executed . a break in the pact came in 1968 with what became known as czechoslovakia 's " prague spring . "
between january and august of that year the reformist communists under alexander dubcek introduced a process of democratization and liberal reforms . reform communism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek came to personify the reform movement in the former czechoslovakia .
dubcek was attempting to create " socialism with a human face , " to include press and religious freedom and a very small-scale introduction of private economy .
but fearing the potential dissolution of the pact , the soviet leadership deployed troops to czechoslovakia . seven thousand tanks rolled towards prague where they violently crushed any notion of relaxing the rules of communism . over 70 people lost their lives and hundreds more were injured .
within a matter of days , the czechoslovakian leadership , which had been carted off to moscow , announced an end to reform socialism . the stalinist hard-line and the supreme position of the soviet union won over that time , but the 1980 's reforms in hungary , poland and eventually under gorbachev in the soviet union , questioned the viability of the pact . the gdr 's membership in the military pact ended with german reunification in october 1990 , after which interest among other signatories dwindled .
moreover , they really wanted to see soviet troops withdraw from their territory , to and become members of western multilateral organizations . on april 12 , 1999 , poland , the czech republic and hungary joined nato , followed by rumania , bulgaria , slovakia , slovenia and the baltic states in 2004 . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks 50 years in nato in may 1955 , europe 's military blocs were laid down when west germany joined nato and east germany became part of the soviet 's warsaw pact , resulting in two german armies which opposed each other until 1989 .
-lrb- may 6 , 2005 -rrb- nato , russia sign military accord nato signed a landmark military cooperation accord with russia at a first-ever ministerial meeting of the alliance on ex-soviet soil .
-lrb- april 21 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : a bigger , not better , nato a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .

in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany . " bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin . " strange and familiar , eerie and cheerful at once , bisky 's paintings speak the language of an ideology that 's as omnipresent and invisible : a claritin realism for a claritin age , " he said . the exhibition runs through may 29 and is open wednesdays through sundays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. torsten gellner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

but the high productivity of german labor and a hefty dose of subsidies from the regional state of saxony have prompted bmw 's management to choose leipzig as the location for their new factory nevertheless . the bmw group invested about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in the best modern-day car manufacturing has to offer - some 360 million of that amount came in the form of subsidies from saxony and the european union .
bmw will produce its 3 series saloon in the new plant .
managers hope that in a few years it will reach full capacity production of 650 cars per day .
construction of the new plant took bmw just under three years . bildunterschrift : the german and saxon flag amid bmw flags outside the plant the plant is the second big investment by a german automaker in leipzig after luxury car manufacturer porsche came to the town a few years ago .
in his inaugural speech , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the new plant as a visible sign that germany remains an attractive location for business . " the secret of economic success is innovation , " he said .
" in view of the pressures of globalized markets , innovative strategies like those of bmw will keep germany ahead of international competition and will ensure that our companies continue to be the best in the world in important technological areas . " an attractive location in recent years , clever economic policies , including less bureaucracy and generous state subsidies , have lured a number of big german companies to the region .
germany 's largest postal courier dhl is planning to make leipzig airport an international hub for its services . bildunterschrift : a conveyor belt in the plant siegfried bülow , the head of porsche 's leipzig plant , also spoke highly of the location . " i can only recommend it , " he said .
" the support we 've received here and the good infrastructure has made it easy for us to decide to come here .
i believe this was also a prime reason for bmw to build its plant in leipzig . " indeed , leipzig was able to beat more than 200 other locations all over europe in a tough competition for the new plant .
now some 5,000 people have been given jobs there .
experts believe the same number of jobs will be created around the factory . words of caution but martin rosenfeld from the economic institute in halle said hopes for a major upswing in the depressed region are still premature . bildunterschrift : taking their first break " bmw will of course improve the job situation , " he said .
" but given the fact that there are about 50,000 people unemployed in leipzig and more than 150,000 in the entire region , the new plant wo n't be able to make a substantial dent in unemployment there .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .

in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin .

on thursday , dutch and german authorities grounded the airline , citing " serious safety deficiencies . " belgium 's transport minister renaat landuyt said authorities planned to step up inspections of planes belonging to onur air banned from flying in several european countries for safety reasons . " every plane will be checked thoroughly .
we do not want to take any risks , " landuyt told the belga news agency late friday . no time limit on ban his comments came after dutch , german , french and swiss authorities announced this week that they were banning onur air flights because of safety concerns . swiss and french authorities said the ban was effective until further notice . on thursday , dutch authorities informed the istanbul-based onur air that it had been grounded for a month due to " serious safety deficiencies observed in respect of aircraft , operational procedures and aircraft handling , " according to a copy of the dutch decision obtained by afp . german authorities followed suit shortly after , telling the company in a fax obtained by afp that all granted permissions had been " revoked with immediate effect due to severe safety concerns . "
it did not say how long the ban would be in effect . airline officials on friday threatened to file a lawsuit over the restrictive measures while turkish transport minister binali yildirim said a meeting between civil aviation officials from the countries concerned was scheduled for monday in the netherlands to settle the dispute . onur fights back onur airlines on saturday rejected claims that its planes were unsafe and vowed to fight the ban . " the safety claims are not fair .
we ourselves would not allow a plane to fly if it had any faults , " the airline 's deputy chairman sahabettin bolukcu told reuters news agency . he added that as many as 50,000 passengers had been affected by the disruption to onur 's service , though many had reached their destinations via other airlines . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans , dutch ground turkish airline a diplomatic dispute between holland and germany on one side and turkey on the other began thursday after dutch and german officials grounded a turkish airline without satisfactory explanation , airline officials say .

with the exception of bremen , the remaining top teams showed a large case of nerves . bayern munich staged a grand finale to their 33-year run at the olympic stadium on saturday with their win over nuremberg - their last match at one of the world 's most famous sports venues .
captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn was presented with the bundesliga championship on the pitch after the game .
bayern clinched their 19th german league title two weeks ago , and so had truly had just one thing to play for on saturday , namely setting up their top striker roy makaay -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- as much as possible in his chase for the goalscoring crown .
the man ahead of him , marek mintal -lrb- 23 goals -rrb- and his nuremberg squad traveled to munich and were given a 6-3 pasting at the hands of the bundesliga champions .
makaay struck twice in the first half , and just as importantly , mintal was held goalless in the last match that bayern will play at olympic stadium .
after the game , the players received their medals from the league .
their last goal is to help makaay score at least two more goals next week against stuttgart .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany . " bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin . " strange and familiar , eerie and cheerful at once , bisky 's paintings speak the language of an ideology that 's as omnipresent and invisible : a claritin realism for a claritin age , " he said . the exhibition runs through may 29 and is open wednesdays through sundays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. torsten gellner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

with the exception of bremen , the remaining top teams showed a large case of nerves . bayern munich staged a grand finale to their 33-year run at the olympic stadium on saturday with their win over nuremberg - their last match at one of the world 's most famous sports venues .
captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn was presented with the bundesliga championship on the pitch after the game .
bayern clinched their 19th german league title two weeks ago , and so had truly had just one thing to play for on saturday , namely setting up their top striker roy makaay -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- as much as possible in his chase for the goalscoring crown .
the man ahead of him , marek mintal -lrb- 23 goals -rrb- and his nuremberg squad traveled to munich and were given a 6-3 pasting at the hands of the bundesliga champions .
makaay struck twice in the first half , and just as importantly , mintal was held goalless in the last match that bayern will play at olympic stadium .
after the game , the players received their medals from the league .
their last goal is to help makaay score at least two more goals next week against stuttgart .
entering the second-to-last match day , second place schalke had the chance to wrap up a spot in the champions league next season - and that against archrivals dortmund to whom schalke had not lost in 12 games .
instead , they lost shockingly , 2-1 , at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ricken -lrb- left -rrb- scored the gamewinning goal against schalke on saturday all the goals came in the first half .

dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was the hero of the match as he stopped numerous top-notch schalke chances .

they remain two points behind schalke but have the daunting task of facing their old coach felix magath and bayern munich .

they could have leapfrogged over the swabians but instead played to a disappointing 0-0 draw against lowly mönchengladbach .
the one point for gladbach means they will stay in the top division next season .
last year 's champions werder bremen turned a 1-0 halftime deficit against last place freiburg into an easy 4-1 victory at weser stadium .
on 56 points , coach thomas schaaf 's side could still squeeze into the champions league qualifications , but are almost assured of a spot in the uefa cup .
for leverkusen , the quest for an uefa cup spot is becoming more and more uncertain .
a late second-half goal by daniel bierofka gave them a draw against wolfsburg .
for the wolves , another disappointment as they surrendered a 2-0 halftime lead at home .

they won the rhineland-palatinate derby on saturday against nearby rivals , kaiserslautern , 3-2 , adding another feather to the cap of coach jürgen klopp .
rostock were playing for pride at home in the first division for at least one year .

with the exception of bremen , the remaining top teams showed a large case of nerves . bayern munich staged a grand finale to their 33-year run at the olympic stadium on saturday with their win over nuremberg - their last match at one of the world 's most famous sports venues .
captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn was presented with the bundesliga championship on the pitch after the game .
bayern clinched their 19th german league title two weeks ago , and so had truly had just one thing to play for on saturday , namely setting up their top striker roy makaay -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- as much as possible in his chase for the goalscoring crown .
the man ahead of him , marek mintal -lrb- 23 goals -rrb- and his nuremberg squad traveled to munich and were given a 6-3 pasting at the hands of the bundesliga champions .
makaay struck twice in the first half , and just as importantly , mintal was held goalless in the last match that bayern will play at olympic stadium .
after the game , the players received their medals from the league .
their last goal is to help makaay score at least two more goals next week against stuttgart .
entering the second-to-last match day , second place schalke had the chance to wrap up a spot in the champions league next season - and that against archrivals dortmund to whom schalke had not lost in 12 games .
instead , they lost shockingly , 2-1 , at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ricken -lrb- left -rrb- scored the gamewinning goal against schalke on saturday all the goals came in the first half .
dortmund scored on their first real chance only to see schalke get the equalizer two minutes later .
just before the end of the first half , dortmund 's homegrown lars ricken scored what would be the gamewinning goal .
dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was the hero of the match as he stopped numerous top-notch schalke chances .
rivals also stumble stuttgart could have been the beneficiaries of schalke 's misfortune but they too dropped their match , losing to relegated side bochum , 2-0 .
they remain two points behind schalke but have the daunting task of facing their old coach felix magath and bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- of stuttgart was silent and his team was silenced 2-0 at bochum hot on stuttgart 's tails were hertha berlin -lrb- 57 points -rrb- .
they could have leapfrogged over the swabians but instead played to a disappointing 0-0 draw against lowly mönchengladbach .
the one point for gladbach means they will stay in the top division next season .
last year 's champions werder bremen turned a 1-0 halftime deficit against last place freiburg into an easy 4-1 victory at weser stadium .
on 56 points , coach thomas schaaf 's side could still squeeze into the champions league qualifications , but are almost assured of a spot in the uefa cup .
for leverkusen , the quest for an uefa cup spot is becoming more and more uncertain .
a late second-half goal by daniel bierofka gave them a draw against wolfsburg .
for the wolves , another disappointment as they surrendered a 2-0 halftime lead at home .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .

in addition , there was a plan to create a joint commando to secure the efficiency of the pact , in other words , a contract between equal partners . just an illusion but it did n't work out that way . the eastern alliance provoked the cold war , with an arms race spanning decades and new threats between east and west . the soviet union became the dominant military force in central and eastern europe , with the position of chief commander of the so-called " united forces " always going to moscow-based soviet officers . ten thousand russian troops were stationed in the warsaw pact countries , with 350,000 in the gdr alone . the pact suffered its first endurance test in 1956 when hungarians demonstrated for an end to stalinism .
weeks of protest led the government to promises of a multi-party system , democracy and freedom of thought . crushing liberty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grave of hungarian premier imre nagy , in a budapest cemetery in october , 1995 .
but russia was not going to take the change lightly , and at the start of november in 1956 , russian tanks rolled into the capital , budapest , where two days of bloody fighting ensued . three thousand people were killed in the uprising , then prime minister imre nagy was dismissed and arrested by the kgb before being sentenced to death in a mock trial .
two years later he , and 239 others involved in the revolution , were executed . a break in the pact came in 1968 with what became known as czechoslovakia 's " prague spring . "
between january and august of that year the reformist communists under alexander dubcek introduced a process of democratization and liberal reforms . reform communism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek came to personify the reform movement in the former czechoslovakia .
dubcek was attempting to create " socialism with a human face , " to include press and religious freedom and a very small-scale introduction of private economy .
but fearing the potential dissolution of the pact , the soviet leadership deployed troops to czechoslovakia . seven thousand tanks rolled towards prague where they violently crushed any notion of relaxing the rules of communism . over 70 people lost their lives and hundreds more were injured .
within a matter of days , the czechoslovakian leadership , which had been carted off to moscow , announced an end to reform socialism . the stalinist hard-line and the supreme position of the soviet union won over that time , but the 1980 's reforms in hungary , poland and eventually under gorbachev in the soviet union , questioned the viability of the pact . the gdr 's membership in the military pact ended with german reunification in october 1990 , after which interest among other signatories dwindled .
moreover , they really wanted to see soviet troops withdraw from their territory , to and become members of western multilateral organizations . on april 12 , 1999 , poland , the czech republic and hungary joined nato , followed by rumania , bulgaria , slovakia , slovenia and the baltic states in 2004 . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks 50 years in nato in may 1955 , europe 's military blocs were laid down when west germany joined nato and east germany became part of the soviet 's warsaw pact , resulting in two german armies which opposed each other until 1989 .

on thursday , dutch and german authorities grounded the airline , citing " serious safety deficiencies . " belgium 's transport minister renaat landuyt said authorities planned to step up inspections of planes belonging to onur air banned from flying in several european countries for safety reasons . " every plane will be checked thoroughly .
we do not want to take any risks , " landuyt told the belga news agency late friday . no time limit on ban his comments came after dutch , german , french and swiss authorities announced this week that they were banning onur air flights because of safety concerns . swiss and french authorities said the ban was effective until further notice . on thursday , dutch authorities informed the istanbul-based onur air that it had been grounded for a month due to " serious safety deficiencies observed in respect of aircraft , operational procedures and aircraft handling , " according to a copy of the dutch decision obtained by afp . german authorities followed suit shortly after , telling the company in a fax obtained by afp that all granted permissions had been " revoked with immediate effect due to severe safety concerns . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.05.2005 eu agrees air travel tax to fund aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plane tickets are about to get more expensive eu finance ministers meeting in luxembourg on saturday agreed in principle to levy a tax on airplane tickets to fund extra development aid .
the tax would be voluntary or obligatory depending on the country . " we have an agreement to introduce voluntary contributions on air tickets , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker during a break in talks he was chairing among finance ministers from the 25 eu member states . but even as he made the announcement , there appeared to be some confusion lingering as to how the tax would work , as well as some dissenting voices among the gathered ministers . austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , for example , attacked the idea as being unfair for consumers and said that austria would not take part .
but according to the belgian minister , the financial burden for air passengers would be small . " this contribution could be one or two euros at the departure of flights , " didier reynders of belgium said after the meeting . compulsory in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new tax would apply to tickets issues in germany the tax would be compulsory in some countries such as belgium , france and germany while other countries such as malta , cyprus and ireland would give passengers the choice of paying the tax . however , the ministers gave up on another idea to tax jet fuel after it won the support of only a small minority . the european union 's executive commission is to hammer out the details of the airline ticket tax ahead of the ministers ' next meeting set for june 7 . german chancellor gerhard schröder backed the ticket tax scheme after it was first floated by french president jacques chirac , seeking a way for rich nations to increase aid to africa and the developing world . according to a document drawn up for the ministers ' meeting in luxembourg , a tax on airplane tickets would be " relatively simple to implement on a flat rate basis on all flights and have no significant evasion / avoidance problems . " it estimated that a tax of 10 euros -lrb- $ 12.60 -rrb- on eu flights and 30 euros on international flights outside the eu would raise six billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- per year .
no figure was agreed in luxembourg , and it appears that the tax would be much smaller than 10 euros . aid proposals due in september eu finance ministers are studying ways of increasing development aid in order to have a package of proposals that can be put forward at a un summit in september . the ministers also broadly agreed to a proposal from the european commission that eu countries should aim to increase development aid to the equivalent of 0.56 percent of gross national income by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 . " most important is that we got a consensus on objectives that were the proposal of the commission to go to 0.56 percent in 2010 and 0.7 percent in 2015 .
this is very important , " austrian minister grasser said after the meeting . the ministers are struggling to find ways to meet the so-called un millennium development goals , which were set in 2000 and aim in particular to slash global poverty in half by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

with the exception of bremen , the remaining top teams showed a large case of nerves . bayern munich staged a grand finale to their 33-year run at the olympic stadium on saturday with their win over nuremberg - their last match at one of the world 's most famous sports venues .
captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn was presented with the bundesliga championship on the pitch after the game .
bayern clinched their 19th german league title two weeks ago , and so had truly had just one thing to play for on saturday , namely setting up their top striker roy makaay -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- as much as possible in his chase for the goalscoring crown .
the man ahead of him , marek mintal -lrb- 23 goals -rrb- and his nuremberg squad traveled to munich and were given a 6-3 pasting at the hands of the bundesliga champions .
makaay struck twice in the first half , and just as importantly , mintal was held goalless in the last match that bayern will play at olympic stadium .
after the game , the players received their medals from the league .
their last goal is to help makaay score at least two more goals next week against stuttgart .
entering the second-to-last match day , second place schalke had the chance to wrap up a spot in the champions league next season - and that against archrivals dortmund to whom schalke had not lost in 12 games .
instead , they lost shockingly , 2-1 , at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ricken -lrb- left -rrb- scored the gamewinning goal against schalke on saturday all the goals came in the first half .
dortmund scored on their first real chance only to see schalke get the equalizer two minutes later .
just before the end of the first half , dortmund 's homegrown lars ricken scored what would be the gamewinning goal .
dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was the hero of the match as he stopped numerous top-notch schalke chances .
rivals also stumble stuttgart could have been the beneficiaries of schalke 's misfortune but they too dropped their match , losing to relegated side bochum , 2-0 .
they remain two points behind schalke but have the daunting task of facing their old coach felix magath and bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- of stuttgart was silent and his team was silenced 2-0 at bochum hot on stuttgart 's tails were hertha berlin -lrb- 57 points -rrb- .
they could have leapfrogged over the swabians but instead played to a disappointing 0-0 draw against lowly mönchengladbach .
the one point for gladbach means they will stay in the top division next season .
last year 's champions werder bremen turned a 1-0 halftime deficit against last place freiburg into an easy 4-1 victory at weser stadium .
on 56 points , coach thomas schaaf 's side could still squeeze into the champions league qualifications , but are almost assured of a spot in the uefa cup .
for leverkusen , the quest for an uefa cup spot is becoming more and more uncertain .
a late second-half goal by daniel bierofka gave them a draw against wolfsburg .
for the wolves , another disappointment as they surrendered a 2-0 halftime lead at home .
new boys win derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio da silva -lrb- left -rrb- and his mainz teammates won the derby against kaiserslautern .
they 'll be in the top division another season one of the league 's most interesting stories this season was mainz .
in their first-ever season in the bundesliga , they beat top-notch squads -lrb- schalke , bremen , leverkusen -rrb- and easily secured a spot for the top division next year .
they won the rhineland-palatinate derby on saturday against nearby rivals , kaiserslautern , 3-2 , adding another feather to the cap of coach jürgen klopp .
rostock were playing for pride at home in the first division for at least one year .
that incentive was n't sufficient enough for them to get beyond a 1-1 draw with bielefeld .
finally , hamburg 's 2-1 loss to hanover means they can write off their hopes of playing in european club competition next season . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .

but the high productivity of german labor and a hefty dose of subsidies from the regional state of saxony have prompted bmw 's management to choose leipzig as the location for their new factory nevertheless . the bmw group invested about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in the best modern-day car manufacturing has to offer - some 360 million of that amount came in the form of subsidies from saxony and the european union .
bmw will produce its 3 series saloon in the new plant .
managers hope that in a few years it will reach full capacity production of 650 cars per day .
construction of the new plant took bmw just under three years . bildunterschrift : the german and saxon flag amid bmw flags outside the plant the plant is the second big investment by a german automaker in leipzig after luxury car manufacturer porsche came to the town a few years ago .
in his inaugural speech , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the new plant as a visible sign that germany remains an attractive location for business . " the secret of economic success is innovation , " he said .
" in view of the pressures of globalized markets , innovative strategies like those of bmw will keep germany ahead of international competition and will ensure that our companies continue to be the best in the world in important technological areas . " an attractive location in recent years , clever economic policies , including less bureaucracy and generous state subsidies , have lured a number of big german companies to the region .
germany 's largest postal courier dhl is planning to make leipzig airport an international hub for its services . bildunterschrift : a conveyor belt in the plant siegfried bülow , the head of porsche 's leipzig plant , also spoke highly of the location . " i can only recommend it , " he said .
" the support we 've received here and the good infrastructure has made it easy for us to decide to come here .
i believe this was also a prime reason for bmw to build its plant in leipzig . " indeed , leipzig was able to beat more than 200 other locations all over europe in a tough competition for the new plant .
now some 5,000 people have been given jobs there .
experts believe the same number of jobs will be created around the factory . words of caution but martin rosenfeld from the economic institute in halle said hopes for a major upswing in the depressed region are still premature . bildunterschrift : taking their first break " bmw will of course improve the job situation , " he said .
" but given the fact that there are about 50,000 people unemployed in leipzig and more than 150,000 in the entire region , the new plant wo n't be able to make a substantial dent in unemployment there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.05.2005 german painter provokes with " aryan art " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky 's blond boys german painter norbert bisky has been criticized for toying with the aestheticism of fascism .
but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany . " bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin . " strange and familiar , eerie and cheerful at once , bisky 's paintings speak the language of an ideology that 's as omnipresent and invisible : a claritin realism for a claritin age , " he said . the exhibition runs through may 29 and is open wednesdays through sundays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. torsten gellner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany . " bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin . " strange and familiar , eerie and cheerful at once , bisky 's paintings speak the language of an ideology that 's as omnipresent and invisible : a claritin realism for a claritin age , " he said . the exhibition runs through may 29 and is open wednesdays through sundays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. torsten gellner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

the charge was that scientists there were in fact " cross-pollinating " animal species . but stefan treue , the director of the center said the experiments have nothing to do with chimaera , as human cells in monkey 's brains can not release any human characteristics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned embryos in fact , the development of chimera , organisms with two or more genetically distinct types of cells , has nothing to do with either stem cell research .
chimera are conceived through the injection of undifferentiated stem cells from the seed of one animal into the early embryo of another animal type .
a new creature then develops out of different genetic characteristics . stem cell specialization researchers at the german primate center and the max-planck institute for biophysical chemistry work in a completely different way .
they have manipulated embryonic human stem cells in test-tubes , teaching them to specialize in the production of the nerve cells which are killed off with the onset of parkinson 's . the question is whether these cells , which would enter the body through an injection into the human brain , can take over the function of the destroyed nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experimenting on rodents is just the first step experiments in which stem cells from mices ' brains were implanted into rats ' brains showed that the transplants in fact caused tumors .
the same thing happened to a particular breed of monkey which received injections of human stem cells into its brain . cancer cell killers at the moment scientists at the max-planck institute for biophysical chemistry are researching what is known as a " terminatorgen " , which kills off cancer cells as they are created .
experiments are currently being performed on rats , and if they prove successful in preventing the growth of tumors in rats ' brains , the experiment will be extended to monkeys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one experimental step before humans but getting permission to do so is not always easy . " it has to be a very important issue to be able to justify the animal 's potential suffering , " stefan treue said . " but before we take the leap to humans , we have to take animals which are similar to us , there 's no way past that .

with the exception of bremen , the remaining top teams showed a large case of nerves . bayern munich staged a grand finale to their 33-year run at the olympic stadium on saturday with their win over nuremberg - their last match at one of the world 's most famous sports venues .
captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn was presented with the bundesliga championship on the pitch after the game .
bayern clinched their 19th german league title two weeks ago , and so had truly had just one thing to play for on saturday , namely setting up their top striker roy makaay -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- as much as possible in his chase for the goalscoring crown .
the man ahead of him , marek mintal -lrb- 23 goals -rrb- and his nuremberg squad traveled to munich and were given a 6-3 pasting at the hands of the bundesliga champions .
makaay struck twice in the first half , and just as importantly , mintal was held goalless in the last match that bayern will play at olympic stadium .
after the game , the players received their medals from the league .
their last goal is to help makaay score at least two more goals next week against stuttgart .
entering the second-to-last match day , second place schalke had the chance to wrap up a spot in the champions league next season - and that against archrivals dortmund to whom schalke had not lost in 12 games .
instead , they lost shockingly , 2-1 , at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ricken -lrb- left -rrb- scored the gamewinning goal against schalke on saturday all the goals came in the first half .
dortmund scored on their first real chance only to see schalke get the equalizer two minutes later .
just before the end of the first half , dortmund 's homegrown lars ricken scored what would be the gamewinning goal .
dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was the hero of the match as he stopped numerous top-notch schalke chances .
rivals also stumble stuttgart could have been the beneficiaries of schalke 's misfortune but they too dropped their match , losing to relegated side bochum , 2-0 .
they remain two points behind schalke but have the daunting task of facing their old coach felix magath and bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- of stuttgart was silent and his team was silenced 2-0 at bochum hot on stuttgart 's tails were hertha berlin -lrb- 57 points -rrb- .
they could have leapfrogged over the swabians but instead played to a disappointing 0-0 draw against lowly mönchengladbach .
the one point for gladbach means they will stay in the top division next season .
last year 's champions werder bremen turned a 1-0 halftime deficit against last place freiburg into an easy 4-1 victory at weser stadium .
on 56 points , coach thomas schaaf 's side could still squeeze into the champions league qualifications , but are almost assured of a spot in the uefa cup .
for leverkusen , the quest for an uefa cup spot is becoming more and more uncertain .
a late second-half goal by daniel bierofka gave them a draw against wolfsburg .
for the wolves , another disappointment as they surrendered a 2-0 halftime lead at home .

in addition , there was a plan to create a joint commando to secure the efficiency of the pact , in other words , a contract between equal partners . just an illusion but it did n't work out that way . the eastern alliance provoked the cold war , with an arms race spanning decades and new threats between east and west . the soviet union became the dominant military force in central and eastern europe , with the position of chief commander of the so-called " united forces " always going to moscow-based soviet officers . ten thousand russian troops were stationed in the warsaw pact countries , with 350,000 in the gdr alone . the pact suffered its first endurance test in 1956 when hungarians demonstrated for an end to stalinism .

two years later he , and 239 others involved in the revolution , were executed . a break in the pact came in 1968 with what became known as czechoslovakia 's " prague spring . "

dubcek was attempting to create " socialism with a human face , " to include press and religious freedom and a very small-scale introduction of private economy .
but fearing the potential dissolution of the pact , the soviet leadership deployed troops to czechoslovakia . seven thousand tanks rolled towards prague where they violently crushed any notion of relaxing the rules of communism . over 70 people lost their lives and hundreds more were injured .
within a matter of days , the czechoslovakian leadership , which had been carted off to moscow , announced an end to reform socialism . the stalinist hard-line and the supreme position of the soviet union won over that time , but the 1980 's reforms in hungary , poland and eventually under gorbachev in the soviet union , questioned the viability of the pact . the gdr 's membership in the military pact ended with german reunification in october 1990 , after which interest among other signatories dwindled .
moreover , they really wanted to see soviet troops withdraw from their territory , to and become members of western multilateral organizations . on april 12 , 1999 , poland , the czech republic and hungary joined nato , followed by rumania , bulgaria , slovakia , slovenia and the baltic states in 2004 . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks 50 years in nato in may 1955 , europe 's military blocs were laid down when west germany joined nato and east germany became part of the soviet 's warsaw pact , resulting in two german armies which opposed each other until 1989 .

but the high productivity of german labor and a hefty dose of subsidies from the regional state of saxony have prompted bmw 's management to choose leipzig as the location for their new factory nevertheless . the bmw group invested about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in the best modern-day car manufacturing has to offer - some 360 million of that amount came in the form of subsidies from saxony and the european union .
bmw will produce its 3 series saloon in the new plant .
managers hope that in a few years it will reach full capacity production of 650 cars per day .
construction of the new plant took bmw just under three years . bildunterschrift : the german and saxon flag amid bmw flags outside the plant the plant is the second big investment by a german automaker in leipzig after luxury car manufacturer porsche came to the town a few years ago .
in his inaugural speech , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the new plant as a visible sign that germany remains an attractive location for business . " the secret of economic success is innovation , " he said .
" in view of the pressures of globalized markets , innovative strategies like those of bmw will keep germany ahead of international competition and will ensure that our companies continue to be the best in the world in important technological areas . " an attractive location in recent years , clever economic policies , including less bureaucracy and generous state subsidies , have lured a number of big german companies to the region .
germany 's largest postal courier dhl is planning to make leipzig airport an international hub for its services . bildunterschrift : a conveyor belt in the plant siegfried bülow , the head of porsche 's leipzig plant , also spoke highly of the location . " i can only recommend it , " he said .
" the support we 've received here and the good infrastructure has made it easy for us to decide to come here .
i believe this was also a prime reason for bmw to build its plant in leipzig . " indeed , leipzig was able to beat more than 200 other locations all over europe in a tough competition for the new plant .
now some 5,000 people have been given jobs there .
experts believe the same number of jobs will be created around the factory . words of caution but martin rosenfeld from the economic institute in halle said hopes for a major upswing in the depressed region are still premature . bildunterschrift : taking their first break " bmw will of course improve the job situation , " he said .
" but given the fact that there are about 50,000 people unemployed in leipzig and more than 150,000 in the entire region , the new plant wo n't be able to make a substantial dent in unemployment there .

in addition , there was a plan to create a joint commando to secure the efficiency of the pact , in other words , a contract between equal partners . just an illusion but it did n't work out that way . the eastern alliance provoked the cold war , with an arms race spanning decades and new threats between east and west . the soviet union became the dominant military force in central and eastern europe , with the position of chief commander of the so-called " united forces " always going to moscow-based soviet officers . ten thousand russian troops were stationed in the warsaw pact countries , with 350,000 in the gdr alone . the pact suffered its first endurance test in 1956 when hungarians demonstrated for an end to stalinism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.05.2005 german painter provokes with " aryan art " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bisky 's blond boys german painter norbert bisky has been criticized for toying with the aestheticism of fascism .
but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany . " bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin . " strange and familiar , eerie and cheerful at once , bisky 's paintings speak the language of an ideology that 's as omnipresent and invisible : a claritin realism for a claritin age , " he said . the exhibition runs through may 29 and is open wednesdays through sundays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. torsten gellner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .

they have manipulated embryonic human stem cells in test-tubes , teaching them to specialize in the production of the nerve cells which are killed off with the onset of parkinson 's . the question is whether these cells , which would enter the body through an injection into the human brain , can take over the function of the destroyed nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experimenting on rodents is just the first step experiments in which stem cells from mices ' brains were implanted into rats ' brains showed that the transplants in fact caused tumors .

the tax would be voluntary or obligatory depending on the country .

" it estimated that a tax of 10 euros -lrb- $ 12.60 -rrb- on eu flights and 30 euros on international flights outside the eu would raise six billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- per year .
no figure was agreed in luxembourg , and it appears that the tax would be much smaller than 10 euros . aid proposals due in september eu finance ministers are studying ways of increasing development aid in order to have a package of proposals that can be put forward at a un summit in september . the ministers also broadly agreed to a proposal from the european commission that eu countries should aim to increase development aid to the equivalent of 0.56 percent of gross national income by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 . " most important is that we got a consensus on objectives that were the proposal of the commission to go to 0.56 percent in 2010 and 0.7 percent in 2015 .
this is very important , " austrian minister grasser said after the meeting . the ministers are struggling to find ways to meet the so-called un millennium development goals , which were set in 2000 and aim in particular to slash global poverty in half by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

in addition , there was a plan to create a joint commando to secure the efficiency of the pact , in other words , a contract between equal partners . just an illusion but it did n't work out that way . the eastern alliance provoked the cold war , with an arms race spanning decades and new threats between east and west . the soviet union became the dominant military force in central and eastern europe , with the position of chief commander of the so-called " united forces " always going to moscow-based soviet officers . ten thousand russian troops were stationed in the warsaw pact countries , with 350,000 in the gdr alone . the pact suffered its first endurance test in 1956 when hungarians demonstrated for an end to stalinism .

but the high productivity of german labor and a hefty dose of subsidies from the regional state of saxony have prompted bmw 's management to choose leipzig as the location for their new factory nevertheless . the bmw group invested about 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- in the best modern-day car manufacturing has to offer - some 360 million of that amount came in the form of subsidies from saxony and the european union .
bmw will produce its 3 series saloon in the new plant .
managers hope that in a few years it will reach full capacity production of 650 cars per day .
construction of the new plant took bmw just under three years . bildunterschrift : the german and saxon flag amid bmw flags outside the plant the plant is the second big investment by a german automaker in leipzig after luxury car manufacturer porsche came to the town a few years ago .
in his inaugural speech , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the new plant as a visible sign that germany remains an attractive location for business . " the secret of economic success is innovation , " he said .
" in view of the pressures of globalized markets , innovative strategies like those of bmw will keep germany ahead of international competition and will ensure that our companies continue to be the best in the world in important technological areas . " an attractive location in recent years , clever economic policies , including less bureaucracy and generous state subsidies , have lured a number of big german companies to the region .

" the support we 've received here and the good infrastructure has made it easy for us to decide to come here .
i believe this was also a prime reason for bmw to build its plant in leipzig . " indeed , leipzig was able to beat more than 200 other locations all over europe in a tough competition for the new plant .
now some 5,000 people have been given jobs there .
experts believe the same number of jobs will be created around the factory . words of caution but martin rosenfeld from the economic institute in halle said hopes for a major upswing in the depressed region are still premature . bildunterschrift : taking their first break " bmw will of course improve the job situation , " he said .
" but given the fact that there are about 50,000 people unemployed in leipzig and more than 150,000 in the entire region , the new plant wo n't be able to make a substantial dent in unemployment there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.05.2005 looking back on the warsaw pact saturday marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the warsaw pact , the military alliance between europe 's eastern bloc nations which underpinned the division between east and west . a couple of days after west germany joined nato , which automatically implied rearmament , heads of government from poland , the soviet union , czechoslovakia , hungary , east germany , rumania and albania signed the warsaw pact . this military power pot was to be the european communist bloc 's answer to the north atlantic treaty organisation , but was also intended as a pact of friendship , co-operation and mutual support . then gdr president otto grotewohl saw the pact as a clear response to west germany joining nato and pledged to secure peace and to provide military support in the case of an attack on one or several of the signatory states to the warsaw alliance .
in addition , there was a plan to create a joint commando to secure the efficiency of the pact , in other words , a contract between equal partners . just an illusion but it did n't work out that way . the eastern alliance provoked the cold war , with an arms race spanning decades and new threats between east and west . the soviet union became the dominant military force in central and eastern europe , with the position of chief commander of the so-called " united forces " always going to moscow-based soviet officers . ten thousand russian troops were stationed in the warsaw pact countries , with 350,000 in the gdr alone . the pact suffered its first endurance test in 1956 when hungarians demonstrated for an end to stalinism .
weeks of protest led the government to promises of a multi-party system , democracy and freedom of thought . crushing liberty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the grave of hungarian premier imre nagy , in a budapest cemetery in october , 1995 .
but russia was not going to take the change lightly , and at the start of november in 1956 , russian tanks rolled into the capital , budapest , where two days of bloody fighting ensued . three thousand people were killed in the uprising , then prime minister imre nagy was dismissed and arrested by the kgb before being sentenced to death in a mock trial .
two years later he , and 239 others involved in the revolution , were executed . a break in the pact came in 1968 with what became known as czechoslovakia 's " prague spring . "
between january and august of that year the reformist communists under alexander dubcek introduced a process of democratization and liberal reforms . reform communism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek came to personify the reform movement in the former czechoslovakia .
dubcek was attempting to create " socialism with a human face , " to include press and religious freedom and a very small-scale introduction of private economy .
but fearing the potential dissolution of the pact , the soviet leadership deployed troops to czechoslovakia . seven thousand tanks rolled towards prague where they violently crushed any notion of relaxing the rules of communism . over 70 people lost their lives and hundreds more were injured .
within a matter of days , the czechoslovakian leadership , which had been carted off to moscow , announced an end to reform socialism . the stalinist hard-line and the supreme position of the soviet union won over that time , but the 1980 's reforms in hungary , poland and eventually under gorbachev in the soviet union , questioned the viability of the pact . the gdr 's membership in the military pact ended with german reunification in october 1990 , after which interest among other signatories dwindled .
moreover , they really wanted to see soviet troops withdraw from their territory , to and become members of western multilateral organizations . on april 12 , 1999 , poland , the czech republic and hungary joined nato , followed by rumania , bulgaria , slovakia , slovenia and the baltic states in 2004 . christiane hoffmann -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany marks 50 years in nato in may 1955 , europe 's military blocs were laid down when west germany joined nato and east germany became part of the soviet 's warsaw pact , resulting in two german armies which opposed each other until 1989 .

with the exception of bremen , the remaining top teams showed a large case of nerves . bayern munich staged a grand finale to their 33-year run at the olympic stadium on saturday with their win over nuremberg - their last match at one of the world 's most famous sports venues .
captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn was presented with the bundesliga championship on the pitch after the game .
bayern clinched their 19th german league title two weeks ago , and so had truly had just one thing to play for on saturday , namely setting up their top striker roy makaay -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- as much as possible in his chase for the goalscoring crown .
the man ahead of him , marek mintal -lrb- 23 goals -rrb- and his nuremberg squad traveled to munich and were given a 6-3 pasting at the hands of the bundesliga champions .
makaay struck twice in the first half , and just as importantly , mintal was held goalless in the last match that bayern will play at olympic stadium .
after the game , the players received their medals from the league .
their last goal is to help makaay score at least two more goals next week against stuttgart .
entering the second-to-last match day , second place schalke had the chance to wrap up a spot in the champions league next season - and that against archrivals dortmund to whom schalke had not lost in 12 games .
instead , they lost shockingly , 2-1 , at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ricken -lrb- left -rrb- scored the gamewinning goal against schalke on saturday all the goals came in the first half .
dortmund scored on their first real chance only to see schalke get the equalizer two minutes later .
just before the end of the first half , dortmund 's homegrown lars ricken scored what would be the gamewinning goal .
dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was the hero of the match as he stopped numerous top-notch schalke chances .
rivals also stumble stuttgart could have been the beneficiaries of schalke 's misfortune but they too dropped their match , losing to relegated side bochum , 2-0 .
they remain two points behind schalke but have the daunting task of facing their old coach felix magath and bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- of stuttgart was silent and his team was silenced 2-0 at bochum hot on stuttgart 's tails were hertha berlin -lrb- 57 points -rrb- .
they could have leapfrogged over the swabians but instead played to a disappointing 0-0 draw against lowly mönchengladbach .
the one point for gladbach means they will stay in the top division next season .
last year 's champions werder bremen turned a 1-0 halftime deficit against last place freiburg into an easy 4-1 victory at weser stadium .
on 56 points , coach thomas schaaf 's side could still squeeze into the champions league qualifications , but are almost assured of a spot in the uefa cup .
for leverkusen , the quest for an uefa cup spot is becoming more and more uncertain .
a late second-half goal by daniel bierofka gave them a draw against wolfsburg .
for the wolves , another disappointment as they surrendered a 2-0 halftime lead at home .

in their first-ever season in the bundesliga , they beat top-notch squads -lrb- schalke , bremen , leverkusen -rrb- and easily secured a spot for the top division next year .
they won the rhineland-palatinate derby on saturday against nearby rivals , kaiserslautern , 3-2 , adding another feather to the cap of coach jürgen klopp .
rostock were playing for pride at home in the first division for at least one year .
that incentive was n't sufficient enough for them to get beyond a 1-1 draw with bielefeld .

the tax would be voluntary or obligatory depending on the country .

the tax would be voluntary or obligatory depending on the country . " we have an agreement to introduce voluntary contributions on air tickets , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker during a break in talks he was chairing among finance ministers from the 25 eu member states . but even as he made the announcement , there appeared to be some confusion lingering as to how the tax would work , as well as some dissenting voices among the gathered ministers . austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , for example , attacked the idea as being unfair for consumers and said that austria would not take part .
but according to the belgian minister , the financial burden for air passengers would be small . " this contribution could be one or two euros at the departure of flights , " didier reynders of belgium said after the meeting . compulsory in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new tax would apply to tickets issues in germany the tax would be compulsory in some countries such as belgium , france and germany while other countries such as malta , cyprus and ireland would give passengers the choice of paying the tax . however , the ministers gave up on another idea to tax jet fuel after it won the support of only a small minority . the european union 's executive commission is to hammer out the details of the airline ticket tax ahead of the ministers ' next meeting set for june 7 . german chancellor gerhard schröder backed the ticket tax scheme after it was first floated by french president jacques chirac , seeking a way for rich nations to increase aid to africa and the developing world . according to a document drawn up for the ministers ' meeting in luxembourg , a tax on airplane tickets would be " relatively simple to implement on a flat rate basis on all flights and have no significant evasion / avoidance problems . " it estimated that a tax of 10 euros -lrb- $ 12.60 -rrb- on eu flights and 30 euros on international flights outside the eu would raise six billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- per year .
no figure was agreed in luxembourg , and it appears that the tax would be much smaller than 10 euros . aid proposals due in september eu finance ministers are studying ways of increasing development aid in order to have a package of proposals that can be put forward at a un summit in september . the ministers also broadly agreed to a proposal from the european commission that eu countries should aim to increase development aid to the equivalent of 0.56 percent of gross national income by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 . " most important is that we got a consensus on objectives that were the proposal of the commission to go to 0.56 percent in 2010 and 0.7 percent in 2015 .
this is very important , " austrian minister grasser said after the meeting . the ministers are struggling to find ways to meet the so-called un millennium development goals , which were set in 2000 and aim in particular to slash global poverty in half by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

with the exception of bremen , the remaining top teams showed a large case of nerves . bayern munich staged a grand finale to their 33-year run at the olympic stadium on saturday with their win over nuremberg - their last match at one of the world 's most famous sports venues .
captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn was presented with the bundesliga championship on the pitch after the game .
bayern clinched their 19th german league title two weeks ago , and so had truly had just one thing to play for on saturday , namely setting up their top striker roy makaay -lrb- 19 goals -rrb- as much as possible in his chase for the goalscoring crown .
the man ahead of him , marek mintal -lrb- 23 goals -rrb- and his nuremberg squad traveled to munich and were given a 6-3 pasting at the hands of the bundesliga champions .
makaay struck twice in the first half , and just as importantly , mintal was held goalless in the last match that bayern will play at olympic stadium .
after the game , the players received their medals from the league .
their last goal is to help makaay score at least two more goals next week against stuttgart .
entering the second-to-last match day , second place schalke had the chance to wrap up a spot in the champions league next season - and that against archrivals dortmund to whom schalke had not lost in 12 games .
instead , they lost shockingly , 2-1 , at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lars ricken -lrb- left -rrb- scored the gamewinning goal against schalke on saturday all the goals came in the first half .
dortmund scored on their first real chance only to see schalke get the equalizer two minutes later .
just before the end of the first half , dortmund 's homegrown lars ricken scored what would be the gamewinning goal .
dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller was the hero of the match as he stopped numerous top-notch schalke chances .
rivals also stumble stuttgart could have been the beneficiaries of schalke 's misfortune but they too dropped their match , losing to relegated side bochum , 2-0 .
they remain two points behind schalke but have the daunting task of facing their old coach felix magath and bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striker kevin kuranyi -lrb- right -rrb- of stuttgart was silent and his team was silenced 2-0 at bochum hot on stuttgart 's tails were hertha berlin -lrb- 57 points -rrb- .
they could have leapfrogged over the swabians but instead played to a disappointing 0-0 draw against lowly mönchengladbach .
the one point for gladbach means they will stay in the top division next season .
last year 's champions werder bremen turned a 1-0 halftime deficit against last place freiburg into an easy 4-1 victory at weser stadium .
on 56 points , coach thomas schaaf 's side could still squeeze into the champions league qualifications , but are almost assured of a spot in the uefa cup .
for leverkusen , the quest for an uefa cup spot is becoming more and more uncertain .
a late second-half goal by daniel bierofka gave them a draw against wolfsburg .
for the wolves , another disappointment as they surrendered a 2-0 halftime lead at home .
new boys win derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antonio da silva -lrb- left -rrb- and his mainz teammates won the derby against kaiserslautern .
they 'll be in the top division another season one of the league 's most interesting stories this season was mainz .
in their first-ever season in the bundesliga , they beat top-notch squads -lrb- schalke , bremen , leverkusen -rrb- and easily secured a spot for the top division next year .
they won the rhineland-palatinate derby on saturday against nearby rivals , kaiserslautern , 3-2 , adding another feather to the cap of coach jürgen klopp .
rostock were playing for pride at home in the first division for at least one year .
that incentive was n't sufficient enough for them to get beyond a 1-1 draw with bielefeld .
finally , hamburg 's 2-1 loss to hanover means they can write off their hopes of playing in european club competition next season . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .

the tax would be voluntary or obligatory depending on the country . " we have an agreement to introduce voluntary contributions on air tickets , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker during a break in talks he was chairing among finance ministers from the 25 eu member states . but even as he made the announcement , there appeared to be some confusion lingering as to how the tax would work , as well as some dissenting voices among the gathered ministers . austrian finance minister karl-heinz grasser , for example , attacked the idea as being unfair for consumers and said that austria would not take part .
but according to the belgian minister , the financial burden for air passengers would be small . " this contribution could be one or two euros at the departure of flights , " didier reynders of belgium said after the meeting . compulsory in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new tax would apply to tickets issues in germany the tax would be compulsory in some countries such as belgium , france and germany while other countries such as malta , cyprus and ireland would give passengers the choice of paying the tax . however , the ministers gave up on another idea to tax jet fuel after it won the support of only a small minority . the european union 's executive commission is to hammer out the details of the airline ticket tax ahead of the ministers ' next meeting set for june 7 . german chancellor gerhard schröder backed the ticket tax scheme after it was first floated by french president jacques chirac , seeking a way for rich nations to increase aid to africa and the developing world . according to a document drawn up for the ministers ' meeting in luxembourg , a tax on airplane tickets would be " relatively simple to implement on a flat rate basis on all flights and have no significant evasion / avoidance problems . " it estimated that a tax of 10 euros -lrb- $ 12.60 -rrb- on eu flights and 30 euros on international flights outside the eu would raise six billion euros -lrb- $ 7.6 billion -rrb- per year .
no figure was agreed in luxembourg , and it appears that the tax would be much smaller than 10 euros . aid proposals due in september eu finance ministers are studying ways of increasing development aid in order to have a package of proposals that can be put forward at a un summit in september . the ministers also broadly agreed to a proposal from the european commission that eu countries should aim to increase development aid to the equivalent of 0.56 percent of gross national income by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 . " most important is that we got a consensus on objectives that were the proposal of the commission to go to 0.56 percent in 2010 and 0.7 percent in 2015 .
this is very important , " austrian minister grasser said after the meeting . the ministers are struggling to find ways to meet the so-called un millennium development goals , which were set in 2000 and aim in particular to slash global poverty in half by 2015 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls grow to tax airlines for pollution in germany , airlines enjoy generous government tax breaks while rail companies pay environmental and fuel taxes , even though they pollute less .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany . " bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin . " strange and familiar , eerie and cheerful at once , bisky 's paintings speak the language of an ideology that 's as omnipresent and invisible : a claritin realism for a claritin age , " he said . the exhibition runs through may 29 and is open wednesdays through sundays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. torsten gellner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

they have manipulated embryonic human stem cells in test-tubes , teaching them to specialize in the production of the nerve cells which are killed off with the onset of parkinson 's . the question is whether these cells , which would enter the body through an injection into the human brain , can take over the function of the destroyed nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experimenting on rodents is just the first step experiments in which stem cells from mices ' brains were implanted into rats ' brains showed that the transplants in fact caused tumors .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany . " bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin . " strange and familiar , eerie and cheerful at once , bisky 's paintings speak the language of an ideology that 's as omnipresent and invisible : a claritin realism for a claritin age , " he said . the exhibition runs through may 29 and is open wednesdays through sundays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. torsten gellner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

the charge was that scientists there were in fact " cross-pollinating " animal species . but stefan treue , the director of the center said the experiments have nothing to do with chimaera , as human cells in monkey 's brains can not release any human characteristics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned embryos in fact , the development of chimera , organisms with two or more genetically distinct types of cells , has nothing to do with either stem cell research .
chimera are conceived through the injection of undifferentiated stem cells from the seed of one animal into the early embryo of another animal type .
a new creature then develops out of different genetic characteristics . stem cell specialization researchers at the german primate center and the max-planck institute for biophysical chemistry work in a completely different way .
they have manipulated embryonic human stem cells in test-tubes , teaching them to specialize in the production of the nerve cells which are killed off with the onset of parkinson 's . the question is whether these cells , which would enter the body through an injection into the human brain , can take over the function of the destroyed nerves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experimenting on rodents is just the first step experiments in which stem cells from mices ' brains were implanted into rats ' brains showed that the transplants in fact caused tumors .
the same thing happened to a particular breed of monkey which received injections of human stem cells into its brain . cancer cell killers at the moment scientists at the max-planck institute for biophysical chemistry are researching what is known as a " terminatorgen " , which kills off cancer cells as they are created .
experiments are currently being performed on rats , and if they prove successful in preventing the growth of tumors in rats ' brains , the experiment will be extended to monkeys . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one experimental step before humans but getting permission to do so is not always easy . " it has to be a very important issue to be able to justify the animal 's potential suffering , " stefan treue said . " but before we take the leap to humans , we have to take animals which are similar to us , there 's no way past that .

but the painter , whose works are currently on display in berlin in his first major solo show , sees things differently . at first sight , bisky 's paintings may remind viewers of leni riefenstahl 's nazi propaganda films : bare-chested lads marching in file ; a blond boy raising his right arm the way the nazis did ; athletic bodies turning somersaults . but having been born in 1970 in leipzig , bisky grew up in a different kind of dictatorship : communist east germany .
he was surrounded by socialist art that glorified the country 's young " pioneers " and depicted them doing physical exercise .
bisky 's omnipresent blond boys are also constantly exercizing and scuffling in front of bright blue skies . while his paintings are bestsellers on the art market , some have criticized these flawless bodies that look like they 've escaped from an aryan cloning laboratory .
his critics accuse him of using a fascist , totalitarian aesthetic in his paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert bisky in front of one of his paintings entitled " war instead of fucking " such accusations drive bisky 's fans crazy .
guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neo-liberal free democrats , for example , thinks left-wingers simply have a problem with beauty . ironic twists a closer examination of bisky 's works also reveals that almost all of his smooth compositions contain a twist .
looking at the blond boys with perfect teeth in the berlin show at bethanien gallery , bisky 's subtle critique of the modern cult of the body becomes apparent . many of his paintings contain ironic fractures : in one , bisky 's blondes playfully scuffle in the foreground as burning helicopters fall from the sky behind .
in another painting , lads stare at a burning house while one of them sneaks off as if leaving the scene of a crime .
the innocence evoked by bright and pure colors and beautiful boys turns out to be deceptive . resisting body fascism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar bisky bisky , whose father , lothar , is the leader of germany 's party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party , sees his art as resistance to the " body fascism " that 's not only promoted by the art of totalitarian regimes but also the advertising industry .
in return , his attempt to beat glossy aestheticism and the glorification of the body with its own weapons has been misunderstood . formerly a student of georg baselitz , bisky is one the young german artists who have rediscovered figurative art and sell well abroad .
bisky actually avoided this form of art in his early works - during his teenage years , he rejected the realist art of the east that he now quotes in his paintings .
at best , these socialist paintings were erotic , he says today .
most times , however , they were simply horrendous , according to him . " if he quotes elements of socialist state art today , he does it with a clear distance , " said christoph tannert , who curated the berlin show .
" bisky rightly rejects accusations of propagating an aryan body cult . " aryan undertones ? but tannert added that bisky 's success in the us might have something to do with its similarity to nazi art . " he 's surely seen in a different light in the us , " he said .
" there , people tend to see more of an ' aryan ' undertone than in germany . " bildunterschrift : norbert bisky during the opening of his show on may 4 with berlin 's self-proclaimed " living art works , " eva and adele art critic graham bader added that bisky 's figures might provoke yet another kind of association in the minds of american viewers : his " synthetic-standardized bodies " are very similar to those in ads for the allergy medication claritin . " strange and familiar , eerie and cheerful at once , bisky 's paintings speak the language of an ideology that 's as omnipresent and invisible : a claritin realism for a claritin age , " he said . the exhibition runs through may 29 and is open wednesdays through sundays from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. torsten gellner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

but increasingly game makers want their creations to match the real world in one crucial respect .
namely the physics used to underpin the action , reaction and interaction of every element in the game world .
not long ago games action was notoriously uniform .
fire a rocket and the resulting explosion would look the same every time .
the scenery may not even be damaged .
real fantasy but better physics means you can let the computer work out what happens when rockets are fired at zombies , bunnies or rebounding surfaces .
it will be different every time .
the physics in ground-breaking games such as half-life 2 and doom iii is only the beginning .
limits on the processing power and computer memory available to game makers means that only relatively large rigid bodies were modelled effectively in these recent titles .
this means that you get a good idea of what happens when grenades meet packing crates or circular saw blades interact with zombies .
what you get is everything splitting or shattering into relatively large chunks .
it does mean that it is hard to model the interaction of anything smaller than those chunks or such things as liquids .
but even this offers a huge range of possibilities so much so that in half-life 2 players get a gravity gun that lets them take advantage of the realistic action / reaction and interaction of objects .
many of the puzzles in the game that held up the progress of its central character gordon freeman revolved around exploiting physics .
the gravity gun was one of the many factors that made half-life 2 fun to play despite its linear plot .
david o 'meara , chief executive of physics software firm havok , said half-life 2 offers a hint of what is to come .
" half-life 2 is the standard now in terms of what the consumers sees , " he said .
" but it was developed over a number of years and the standard of physics today is not what the consumer sees . "
already there are games that can model interactions using elements as small as bullets and realistically show what happens when they hit a foot or ankle , said mr o 'meara .
the next big change is modelling interactions between objects and environments made of particles - effectively big molecules .
this will give game designers unprecedented freedom to build worlds and have the objects , animals and people in them react to each other like their real world equivalents .
the next generation of consoles and powerful desktop pcs will give designers the scope to model entire worlds of such small elements , said mr o 'meara , although there were going to be moments when other things , such as animation of faces have prior calls on memory and processing power .
there are also more firms producing physics engines , such as ageia , meqon and others , that developers can use to give games a more realistic feel .
" there are games coming out where we know what 's been achieved and it is at least as startling as what has been seen in half-life 2 , " he said .
handheld help better physics is not just restricted to consoles and pcs .
mobile phones are getting their own physics engines too .
i-play , formerly digital bridges , has produced a game for mobile phones called nate adams - freestyle motocross that exploits realistic physics to make the title more challenging .
as its name implies the game gives the player to chance to emulate the antics and tricks of motocross superstar nate adams .
though it features only a bike , rider and a variety of hilly courses the game is surprisingly challenging , thanks to physics , said darren hedges , an i-play developer who helped put the title together .
key presses control how far forward and back the in-game nate leans which radically changes the way the bike reacts .
" in a normal sprite-based system if a bike was to crash into the ground at a series of intervals it would always look the same , " he said .
" but good physics means that nate comes off his bike a myriad of different ways with a myriad number of results , " said mr hedges .
" it allows us to have bike and rider as two separate entities and that allows the user to be punished for making mistakes , " he said .
" we do n't want the game punishing the user , " he said .
" we want the user punishing the user . "

limits on the processing power and computer memory available to game makers means that only relatively large rigid bodies were modelled effectively in these recent titles .
this means that you get a good idea of what happens when grenades meet packing crates or circular saw blades interact with zombies .

it does mean that it is hard to model the interaction of anything smaller than those chunks or such things as liquids .

already there are games that can model interactions using elements as small as bullets and realistically show what happens when they hit a foot or ankle , said mr o 'meara .
the next big change is modelling interactions between objects and environments made of particles - effectively big molecules .
this will give game designers unprecedented freedom to build worlds and have the objects , animals and people in them react to each other like their real world equivalents .
the next generation of consoles and powerful desktop pcs will give designers the scope to model entire worlds of such small elements , said mr o 'meara , although there were going to be moments when other things , such as animation of faces have prior calls on memory and processing power .
there are also more firms producing physics engines , such as ageia , meqon and others , that developers can use to give games a more realistic feel .

dr peter wilford , senior partner at a medical practice in maidstone , turns 50 on 15 may , followed by company director desmond high on 23 may .
in the week in between their birthdays they aim to raise £ 50,000 for five charities by completing a series of " 50-themed challenges " .
their task begins on saturday with a 50-mile bike ride in the weald of kent .
they will start and finish at the marden headquarters of the kent air ambulance trust , one of the five charities which will benefit from their efforts .
' barking mad ' other causes set to benefit are the heart of kent hospice , farm-africa , sight savers international and the duchenne family support group , which supports families affected by muscular dystrophy .
dr wilford and mr high will also do 50 lengths at maidstone swimming pool on 16 may , another 50-mile bike ride in kent on 17 may , and finally a combined 50km on a rowing machine at the museum of kent life near maidstone on 21 may .
dr wilford said : " when desmond first suggested this , my professional opinion was that he was barking mad .
" once i had recovered from the shock i realised it was a great idea . "
mr high said the charities they are supporting are ones " where we can see that the money raised will make a clear difference " .

showa day , after the name hirohito himself chose for his reign , is intended to mark japan 's post-war rebirth as well as look to the future .
but critics say the move will upset other nations , especially china and the two koreas , who will say it glorifies japan 's often brutal militaristic past .
a similar bill was abandoned in the past , due to political pressure .
but this time the main opposition democratic party of japan backed the bill , which was proposed by the ruling coalition .
the opposition said it now accepted the idea that the holiday would encourage public reflection of the turbulent 63 years of hirohito 's reign , rather than glorify the emperor himself .
' turbulent days ' the lower house of parliament voted in favour of the showa day holiday last month , and on friday the upper house approved the bill by 202-14 .
the chosen date , 29 april , is already a national holiday , currently celebrated as greenery day .
under the new law , greenery day will be moved to 4 may , which is currently called people 's day .
opinion remains divided on hirohito 's legacy .
many japanese see him as being a benign figure out of touch with his militarist cabinet , while others insist he was intimately involved in the planning of the war .
following his death in 1989 , the holiday marking hirohito 's birthday was renamed greenery day - an oblique reference to the late emperor 's passion for plants , but one which avoided using his name .
the re-named showa day is a more direct reference to the emperor 's era .
the bill enacting the new name was promoted by members of prime minister koizumi 's liberal democratic party , which argues that japan has already apologised enough for its past .
but correspondents say the move will upset other asian nations because it refers to the period when japanese troops brutally occupied neighbouring states .
tensions are already high over japan 's perceived failure to acknowledge its past abuses .
violent anti-japan protests erupted in china last month over the wording of a japanese history textbook , as well as tokyo 's push for a permanent un security council seat .
