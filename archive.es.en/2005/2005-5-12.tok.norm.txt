europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

but now , following several rulings by the world trade organization , the european union is obliged to change this system by jan .
1 next year - much to the dismay of producers the world over . the " banana war , " as it has become commonly known , has been generating heat for the past decade . there are two main factions : the europeans , who give preferential treatment to their former colonies -lrb- acp states -rrb- by guaranteeing them generous european quotas , and the south american producers who dominate the us market . so-called " dollar bananas " are substantially cheaper than the acp ones , but there is a limit to how many can currently be exported to european soil .

for years they 've been complaining about a race for the lowest standards in the banana trade , and because too many bananas are being produced , prices and social conditions are falling .
bettina burkert of the banafair organization said the new eu rules would speed up the race . " we are calling on the eu to put a moratorium on the move , so instead of it coming into effect next january , research could be conducted into how it would affect south american and caribbean producers , " she said . various interest groups are demanding a differentiated system in which the level of import duty would depend upon whether the bananas were produced in a socially fair and ecologically sound way . but karl-friedrich falkenberg said he does n't believe that such regulations would augment the fairness of the banana trade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2005 germany approves eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was supported by government and opposition german parliamentarians overwhelmingly approved the eu constitution on thursday .
while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .
" the german ratification process is a stitch-up , " he said .
" the politicians are simply going ahead with its implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker put up posters that read " europe deserves a yes " , in reference to the upcoming referendum in france , on the eu constitution in the southern city of marseilles , france , wednesday , may 4 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / claude paris -rrb- while other european nations have been mulling over the pros and cons of the eu constitution in recent months , berlin has managed to sweep the issue under the carpet . " if we were to hold a general knowledge quiz about the contents of the european constitution in france and germany , " pointed out huffschmid , " germany would come out of it pretty badly . " " not even the media are paying any attention to the matter , " said janis .
a. emmanouilidis , eu expert at the munich center for applied political research and an advisor at the foreign ministry 's european department . " the best compromise " berlin 's vote comes one day after austria 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the charter - with its upper house expected to approve the treaty right before france holds its hotly-contested referendum on may 29 . slovakia also approved the constitution wednesday , bringing the number of states to have approved the treaty up to seven .
in order for the constitution to take effect , it must be ratified by all 25 member states . speaking in the bundestag on thursday , german chancellor gerhard schröder underlined the importance of germany voting in favor of the eu constitution , which is designed to define the powers and institutions of the eu , outline divisions of responsibility and streamline decision-making . " i ask you not to be too petty or too obsessed with the detail of the odd half sentence that may not completely meet our expectations , " said schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian tricolor and european union flags are seen on at the side entrance of the renovated berlaymont commission building in brussels , thursday oct.21 , 2004 .
eu commission president romano prodi inaugurated the renovated berlaymont building which will become the home of the european union 's head office after years of scandal and chaos surrounding the restoration .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the charter makes some changes in leadership - the commission president will continue to lead the body responsible for proposing and executing eu laws .
but the european council will now elect a president for a two-and-a-half year term , renewable once .
the current system of rotating the presidency every six months will be discontinued .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.05.2005 banana trade facing unfruitful change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans just love their bananas europeans eat a lot of bananas and are willing to pay generous prices for the pleasure , but if a new ruling on import duty becomes reality , they may find the market swamped with bunches of cheap , poorly produced fruit . the continental banana market is specially protected by a system of quotas dictating which regions are allowed to supply what quantities of bananas to europe .
but now , following several rulings by the world trade organization , the european union is obliged to change this system by jan .
1 next year - much to the dismay of producers the world over . the " banana war , " as it has become commonly known , has been generating heat for the past decade . there are two main factions : the europeans , who give preferential treatment to their former colonies -lrb- acp states -rrb- by guaranteeing them generous european quotas , and the south american producers who dominate the us market . so-called " dollar bananas " are substantially cheaper than the acp ones , but there is a limit to how many can currently be exported to european soil .
those that are exported are stung with a duty charge . encouraging cheap production but the world trade organization has ruled that that should all change .
karl-friedrich falkenberg , who heads the trade directorate of the european commission , said the new ruling would increase the drive towards cheap mass production . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banana production in colombia " those who produce more cheaply will have the chance to sell more , " he said .
" these historic rights will dissolve and the more competitive will get a bigger share of the world market . " from 2006 , the present quota and duty system will be replaced by a duty only system with no limit on volume .
the eu plan , which foresees an import duty of 230 euros -lrb- $ 293 -rrb- per ton of bananas , has sparked outrage among producers in both the former colonies and in latin america . social tsunami gilberth bermudez of colsiba , the umbrella organization of south american banana workers trade unions said he fears that a removal of the limit on volume will trigger a fall in prices . " there will be a social tsunami with thousands of lost jobs and companies forced to move elsewhere , " he said .
" wages would fall and social conditions would worsen .
the poverty in central america , where more than three million people depend on the banana trade , would get even worse .
but africans would also get poorer because the companies are only interested in absolutely inefficient social standards . " international non-governmental organizations share this worry .
for years they 've been complaining about a race for the lowest standards in the banana trade , and because too many bananas are being produced , prices and social conditions are falling .
bettina burkert of the banafair organization said the new eu rules would speed up the race . " we are calling on the eu to put a moratorium on the move , so instead of it coming into effect next january , research could be conducted into how it would affect south american and caribbean producers , " she said . various interest groups are demanding a differentiated system in which the level of import duty would depend upon whether the bananas were produced in a socially fair and ecologically sound way . but karl-friedrich falkenberg said he does n't believe that such regulations would augment the fairness of the banana trade . " much is down to the consumers , " he said " if they go for the cheapest bananas , they 'll be buying the ones produced under the worst social conditions . " falkenberg added he is convinced that the new system of duty only will be implemented , but just how costly that will be is to be decided in the coming weeks by the world trade organization . christiane wolters -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu banana skin awaits fruit growers germany 's fruit traders are finding it tough to swallow a new eu directive which could see duties on the popular banana rise threefold by next year .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .
but i think we are on the way to normal . " over time , germany developed into a reliable friend to israel , in addition to becoming a top trading partner .
and even though in the past , germany has n't played a strong role in the peace process , the country is becoming more active on this front , recognizing that its past gives it special obligations to help the jews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.05.2005 banana trade facing unfruitful change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans just love their bananas europeans eat a lot of bananas and are willing to pay generous prices for the pleasure , but if a new ruling on import duty becomes reality , they may find the market swamped with bunches of cheap , poorly produced fruit . the continental banana market is specially protected by a system of quotas dictating which regions are allowed to supply what quantities of bananas to europe .
but now , following several rulings by the world trade organization , the european union is obliged to change this system by jan .
1 next year - much to the dismay of producers the world over . the " banana war , " as it has become commonly known , has been generating heat for the past decade . there are two main factions : the europeans , who give preferential treatment to their former colonies -lrb- acp states -rrb- by guaranteeing them generous european quotas , and the south american producers who dominate the us market . so-called " dollar bananas " are substantially cheaper than the acp ones , but there is a limit to how many can currently be exported to european soil .
those that are exported are stung with a duty charge . encouraging cheap production but the world trade organization has ruled that that should all change .
karl-friedrich falkenberg , who heads the trade directorate of the european commission , said the new ruling would increase the drive towards cheap mass production . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banana production in colombia " those who produce more cheaply will have the chance to sell more , " he said .
" these historic rights will dissolve and the more competitive will get a bigger share of the world market . " from 2006 , the present quota and duty system will be replaced by a duty only system with no limit on volume .
the eu plan , which foresees an import duty of 230 euros -lrb- $ 293 -rrb- per ton of bananas , has sparked outrage among producers in both the former colonies and in latin america . social tsunami gilberth bermudez of colsiba , the umbrella organization of south american banana workers trade unions said he fears that a removal of the limit on volume will trigger a fall in prices . " there will be a social tsunami with thousands of lost jobs and companies forced to move elsewhere , " he said .
" wages would fall and social conditions would worsen .
the poverty in central america , where more than three million people depend on the banana trade , would get even worse .
but africans would also get poorer because the companies are only interested in absolutely inefficient social standards . " international non-governmental organizations share this worry .
for years they 've been complaining about a race for the lowest standards in the banana trade , and because too many bananas are being produced , prices and social conditions are falling .
bettina burkert of the banafair organization said the new eu rules would speed up the race . " we are calling on the eu to put a moratorium on the move , so instead of it coming into effect next january , research could be conducted into how it would affect south american and caribbean producers , " she said . various interest groups are demanding a differentiated system in which the level of import duty would depend upon whether the bananas were produced in a socially fair and ecologically sound way . but karl-friedrich falkenberg said he does n't believe that such regulations would augment the fairness of the banana trade . " much is down to the consumers , " he said " if they go for the cheapest bananas , they 'll be buying the ones produced under the worst social conditions . " falkenberg added he is convinced that the new system of duty only will be implemented , but just how costly that will be is to be decided in the coming weeks by the world trade organization . christiane wolters -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu banana skin awaits fruit growers germany 's fruit traders are finding it tough to swallow a new eu directive which could see duties on the popular banana rise threefold by next year .

but now , following several rulings by the world trade organization , the european union is obliged to change this system by jan .
1 next year - much to the dismay of producers the world over . the " banana war , " as it has become commonly known , has been generating heat for the past decade . there are two main factions : the europeans , who give preferential treatment to their former colonies -lrb- acp states -rrb- by guaranteeing them generous european quotas , and the south american producers who dominate the us market . so-called " dollar bananas " are substantially cheaper than the acp ones , but there is a limit to how many can currently be exported to european soil .
those that are exported are stung with a duty charge . encouraging cheap production but the world trade organization has ruled that that should all change .
karl-friedrich falkenberg , who heads the trade directorate of the european commission , said the new ruling would increase the drive towards cheap mass production . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banana production in colombia " those who produce more cheaply will have the chance to sell more , " he said .
" these historic rights will dissolve and the more competitive will get a bigger share of the world market . " from 2006 , the present quota and duty system will be replaced by a duty only system with no limit on volume .
the eu plan , which foresees an import duty of 230 euros -lrb- $ 293 -rrb- per ton of bananas , has sparked outrage among producers in both the former colonies and in latin america . social tsunami gilberth bermudez of colsiba , the umbrella organization of south american banana workers trade unions said he fears that a removal of the limit on volume will trigger a fall in prices . " there will be a social tsunami with thousands of lost jobs and companies forced to move elsewhere , " he said .
" wages would fall and social conditions would worsen .
the poverty in central america , where more than three million people depend on the banana trade , would get even worse .
but africans would also get poorer because the companies are only interested in absolutely inefficient social standards . " international non-governmental organizations share this worry .
for years they 've been complaining about a race for the lowest standards in the banana trade , and because too many bananas are being produced , prices and social conditions are falling .
bettina burkert of the banafair organization said the new eu rules would speed up the race . " we are calling on the eu to put a moratorium on the move , so instead of it coming into effect next january , research could be conducted into how it would affect south american and caribbean producers , " she said . various interest groups are demanding a differentiated system in which the level of import duty would depend upon whether the bananas were produced in a socially fair and ecologically sound way . but karl-friedrich falkenberg said he does n't believe that such regulations would augment the fairness of the banana trade . " much is down to the consumers , " he said " if they go for the cheapest bananas , they 'll be buying the ones produced under the worst social conditions . " falkenberg added he is convinced that the new system of duty only will be implemented , but just how costly that will be is to be decided in the coming weeks by the world trade organization . christiane wolters -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu banana skin awaits fruit growers germany 's fruit traders are finding it tough to swallow a new eu directive which could see duties on the popular banana rise threefold by next year .

his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial .

"
he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .
" the memorial must not be allowed to become a cemetery or a shrine .
and if this happens , we jews will have to consider whether we can enter this place . " paul spiegel has already voiced his criticism of the memorial project , which he says does n't go far enough .
" by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " he said at the opening ceremony on tuesday . on those grounds , he added that the information center underneath the memorial site which documents the fate of europe 's jews was an " indispensable addition .

while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .
" the german ratification process is a stitch-up , " he said .
" the politicians are simply going ahead with its implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker put up posters that read " europe deserves a yes " , in reference to the upcoming referendum in france , on the eu constitution in the southern city of marseilles , france , wednesday , may 4 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / claude paris -rrb- while other european nations have been mulling over the pros and cons of the eu constitution in recent months , berlin has managed to sweep the issue under the carpet . " if we were to hold a general knowledge quiz about the contents of the european constitution in france and germany , " pointed out huffschmid , " germany would come out of it pretty badly . " " not even the media are paying any attention to the matter , " said janis .
a. emmanouilidis , eu expert at the munich center for applied political research and an advisor at the foreign ministry 's european department . " the best compromise " berlin 's vote comes one day after austria 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the charter - with its upper house expected to approve the treaty right before france holds its hotly-contested referendum on may 29 . slovakia also approved the constitution wednesday , bringing the number of states to have approved the treaty up to seven .
in order for the constitution to take effect , it must be ratified by all 25 member states . speaking in the bundestag on thursday , german chancellor gerhard schröder underlined the importance of germany voting in favor of the eu constitution , which is designed to define the powers and institutions of the eu , outline divisions of responsibility and streamline decision-making . " i ask you not to be too petty or too obsessed with the detail of the odd half sentence that may not completely meet our expectations , " said schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian tricolor and european union flags are seen on at the side entrance of the renovated berlaymont commission building in brussels , thursday oct.21 , 2004 .
eu commission president romano prodi inaugurated the renovated berlaymont building which will become the home of the european union 's head office after years of scandal and chaos surrounding the restoration .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the charter makes some changes in leadership - the commission president will continue to lead the body responsible for proposing and executing eu laws .
but the european council will now elect a president for a two-and-a-half year term , renewable once .
the current system of rotating the presidency every six months will be discontinued .
the constitution also establishes the new position of foreign minister , who will speak on the eu 's behalf on agreed common policy . " the constitution is not perfect , but it 's the best compromise we were able to reach , " said emmanouilidis .
" it makes the eu more effective and more democratic . " concerns but it 's not without its critics .
" german concerns have risen with reports of organized crime and wage-undercutting from eastward expansion at a time when the german economy is not doing well , " said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute , in an interview with reuters news agency . while the majority of germans say they support the treaty , the general image of the brussels administration within germany has seen better days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press has been quick to highlight tales of local workers losing out to cheaper eastern european arrivals , while chancellor schröder 's repeated run-ins with brussels reflect popular disapproval of a series of eu plans . together with french president jacques chirac , schröder has been an outspoken critic of the eu 's services directive , which germans fear will allow eastern european service firms to undercut them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2005 germany approves eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was supported by government and opposition german parliamentarians overwhelmingly approved the eu constitution on thursday .
while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .
" the german ratification process is a stitch-up , " he said .
" the politicians are simply going ahead with its implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker put up posters that read " europe deserves a yes " , in reference to the upcoming referendum in france , on the eu constitution in the southern city of marseilles , france , wednesday , may 4 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / claude paris -rrb- while other european nations have been mulling over the pros and cons of the eu constitution in recent months , berlin has managed to sweep the issue under the carpet . " if we were to hold a general knowledge quiz about the contents of the european constitution in france and germany , " pointed out huffschmid , " germany would come out of it pretty badly . " " not even the media are paying any attention to the matter , " said janis .
a. emmanouilidis , eu expert at the munich center for applied political research and an advisor at the foreign ministry 's european department . " the best compromise " berlin 's vote comes one day after austria 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the charter - with its upper house expected to approve the treaty right before france holds its hotly-contested referendum on may 29 . slovakia also approved the constitution wednesday , bringing the number of states to have approved the treaty up to seven .
in order for the constitution to take effect , it must be ratified by all 25 member states . speaking in the bundestag on thursday , german chancellor gerhard schröder underlined the importance of germany voting in favor of the eu constitution , which is designed to define the powers and institutions of the eu , outline divisions of responsibility and streamline decision-making . " i ask you not to be too petty or too obsessed with the detail of the odd half sentence that may not completely meet our expectations , " said schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian tricolor and european union flags are seen on at the side entrance of the renovated berlaymont commission building in brussels , thursday oct.21 , 2004 .
eu commission president romano prodi inaugurated the renovated berlaymont building which will become the home of the european union 's head office after years of scandal and chaos surrounding the restoration .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the charter makes some changes in leadership - the commission president will continue to lead the body responsible for proposing and executing eu laws .
but the european council will now elect a president for a two-and-a-half year term , renewable once .
the current system of rotating the presidency every six months will be discontinued .
the constitution also establishes the new position of foreign minister , who will speak on the eu 's behalf on agreed common policy . " the constitution is not perfect , but it 's the best compromise we were able to reach , " said emmanouilidis .
" it makes the eu more effective and more democratic . " concerns but it 's not without its critics .
" german concerns have risen with reports of organized crime and wage-undercutting from eastward expansion at a time when the german economy is not doing well , " said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute , in an interview with reuters news agency . while the majority of germans say they support the treaty , the general image of the brussels administration within germany has seen better days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press has been quick to highlight tales of local workers losing out to cheaper eastern european arrivals , while chancellor schröder 's repeated run-ins with brussels reflect popular disapproval of a series of eu plans . together with french president jacques chirac , schröder has been an outspoken critic of the eu 's services directive , which germans fear will allow eastern european service firms to undercut them .
berlin says its contributions to the eu budget subsidize lower corporate tax among new entrants and put german jobs at risk , promoting calls for harmonized tax rates . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders make joint appeal ahead of eu vote with just over a month to go before skeptical french voters cast their ballots on the eu constitution , president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder joined forces tuesday to back the treaty .

the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public .
-lrb- may 10 , 2005 -rrb- eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

" let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

now that the shout of thousands of soccer fans around the world have calmed after their " winning " world cup tickets were revealed to be nothing but an e-mail virus , investigators believe the virus ' creator might be german .
though technical details seem to show the e-mail as originating from germany , it 's the programmer 's excellent language skills that many are basing their assumptions on .
who else , besides a native , could put together a cunning message in perfect german , experts wonder ?
the germany 2006 world cup organizing committee will have to hope investigators are able to come up with more substantial , preferable non-linguistic , evidence in order to catch the person who crashed their web servers earlier this month .
at least one person who received his share of the over 2.3 million messages estimated to have been created by the virus replied to germany 2006 world cup organizing committee .
his message : " when are you going to get it ?
i do n't want your tickets !

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

" i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you think the eu should keep talking to iran or take the matter to the un security council ?

but now , following several rulings by the world trade organization , the european union is obliged to change this system by jan .
1 next year - much to the dismay of producers the world over . the " banana war , " as it has become commonly known , has been generating heat for the past decade . there are two main factions : the europeans , who give preferential treatment to their former colonies -lrb- acp states -rrb- by guaranteeing them generous european quotas , and the south american producers who dominate the us market . so-called " dollar bananas " are substantially cheaper than the acp ones , but there is a limit to how many can currently be exported to european soil .
those that are exported are stung with a duty charge . encouraging cheap production but the world trade organization has ruled that that should all change .
karl-friedrich falkenberg , who heads the trade directorate of the european commission , said the new ruling would increase the drive towards cheap mass production . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banana production in colombia " those who produce more cheaply will have the chance to sell more , " he said .
" these historic rights will dissolve and the more competitive will get a bigger share of the world market . " from 2006 , the present quota and duty system will be replaced by a duty only system with no limit on volume .
the eu plan , which foresees an import duty of 230 euros -lrb- $ 293 -rrb- per ton of bananas , has sparked outrage among producers in both the former colonies and in latin america . social tsunami gilberth bermudez of colsiba , the umbrella organization of south american banana workers trade unions said he fears that a removal of the limit on volume will trigger a fall in prices . " there will be a social tsunami with thousands of lost jobs and companies forced to move elsewhere , " he said .
" wages would fall and social conditions would worsen .
the poverty in central america , where more than three million people depend on the banana trade , would get even worse .
but africans would also get poorer because the companies are only interested in absolutely inefficient social standards . " international non-governmental organizations share this worry .
for years they 've been complaining about a race for the lowest standards in the banana trade , and because too many bananas are being produced , prices and social conditions are falling .
bettina burkert of the banafair organization said the new eu rules would speed up the race . " we are calling on the eu to put a moratorium on the move , so instead of it coming into effect next january , research could be conducted into how it would affect south american and caribbean producers , " she said . various interest groups are demanding a differentiated system in which the level of import duty would depend upon whether the bananas were produced in a socially fair and ecologically sound way . but karl-friedrich falkenberg said he does n't believe that such regulations would augment the fairness of the banana trade . " much is down to the consumers , " he said " if they go for the cheapest bananas , they 'll be buying the ones produced under the worst social conditions . " falkenberg added he is convinced that the new system of duty only will be implemented , but just how costly that will be is to be decided in the coming weeks by the world trade organization . christiane wolters -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu banana skin awaits fruit growers germany 's fruit traders are finding it tough to swallow a new eu directive which could see duties on the popular banana rise threefold by next year .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession . " in light of turkey 's accession negotiations , a new trial would be highly significant , " said german-kurdish member of the european parliament feleknas uca . rolf gössner , president of the league of human rights , agrees .
" the way this case is being dealt with is key to the credible development of human rights in turkey , " he told deutsche welle . no call for re-trial " a new trial is not explicitly ordered , " said ocalan 's lawyer marc müller , " but the judgement indicates that the court believes this is the best option . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to observers , ocalan would , in all likelihood , be convicted again .
" ocalan will be given the same sentence even if he is tried one hundred times , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gül -lrb- photo -rrb- this week . inhumane treatement arrested in kenya in 1999 amid public jubilation in turkey , ocalan was tried and condemned to capital punishment under a justice system now abolished by ankara as part of sweeping reforms to bring the country into line with eu entry conditions .
his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial . " the european commission expects that turkey will respect this decision of the court of human rights .
turkey is a member of the council of europe so it is a duty to implement all the decisions of the court , " an eu spokesman told reporters . turkey expressed discontent with the court ruling but said it would address the flaws in his conviction in a move that will help the country keep its eu membership bid on track .
a senior lawmaker from the governing justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , sadullah ergin , immediately branded the ruling " undesired , " while the party 's deputy chairman said turkey would take steps to fulfill its obligations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2005 germany approves eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was supported by government and opposition german parliamentarians overwhelmingly approved the eu constitution on thursday .
while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .
" the german ratification process is a stitch-up , " he said .
" the politicians are simply going ahead with its implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker put up posters that read " europe deserves a yes " , in reference to the upcoming referendum in france , on the eu constitution in the southern city of marseilles , france , wednesday , may 4 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / claude paris -rrb- while other european nations have been mulling over the pros and cons of the eu constitution in recent months , berlin has managed to sweep the issue under the carpet . " if we were to hold a general knowledge quiz about the contents of the european constitution in france and germany , " pointed out huffschmid , " germany would come out of it pretty badly . " " not even the media are paying any attention to the matter , " said janis .
a. emmanouilidis , eu expert at the munich center for applied political research and an advisor at the foreign ministry 's european department .

"
he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .
" the memorial must not be allowed to become a cemetery or a shrine .
and if this happens , we jews will have to consider whether we can enter this place . " paul spiegel has already voiced his criticism of the memorial project , which he says does n't go far enough .
" by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " he said at the opening ceremony on tuesday . on those grounds , he added that the information center underneath the memorial site which documents the fate of europe 's jews was an " indispensable addition .

"
he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .
" the memorial must not be allowed to become a cemetery or a shrine .
and if this happens , we jews will have to consider whether we can enter this place . " paul spiegel has already voiced his criticism of the memorial project , which he says does n't go far enough .
" by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " he said at the opening ceremony on tuesday . on those grounds , he added that the information center underneath the memorial site which documents the fate of europe 's jews was an " indispensable addition .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .

" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .

qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .

" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .

"
he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .
" the memorial must not be allowed to become a cemetery or a shrine .
and if this happens , we jews will have to consider whether we can enter this place . " paul spiegel has already voiced his criticism of the memorial project , which he says does n't go far enough .
" by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " he said at the opening ceremony on tuesday . on those grounds , he added that the information center underneath the memorial site which documents the fate of europe 's jews was an " indispensable addition .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bricklayer ?

" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession . " in light of turkey 's accession negotiations , a new trial would be highly significant , " said german-kurdish member of the european parliament feleknas uca . rolf gössner , president of the league of human rights , agrees .
" the way this case is being dealt with is key to the credible development of human rights in turkey , " he told deutsche welle . no call for re-trial " a new trial is not explicitly ordered , " said ocalan 's lawyer marc müller , " but the judgement indicates that the court believes this is the best option . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to observers , ocalan would , in all likelihood , be convicted again .
" ocalan will be given the same sentence even if he is tried one hundred times , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gül -lrb- photo -rrb- this week . inhumane treatement arrested in kenya in 1999 amid public jubilation in turkey , ocalan was tried and condemned to capital punishment under a justice system now abolished by ankara as part of sweeping reforms to bring the country into line with eu entry conditions .
his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .

" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .

not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .
but i think we are on the way to normal . " over time , germany developed into a reliable friend to israel , in addition to becoming a top trading partner .
and even though in the past , germany has n't played a strong role in the peace process , the country is becoming more active on this front , recognizing that its past gives it special obligations to help the jews . " one ca n't bury or forget the past , " former german chancellor helmut kohl once said .
" because a people that does n't know its past , ca n't understand the present and ca n't construct the future .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .

a court in essen threw out 48-year-old hans josef brinkmann 's claim , ruling that the packaging of coca-cola 's bottles and cans was clearly labelled with its sugary content .
" it is generally known by consumers that the consumption of products containing sugar can have damaging effects on your health , " the judgement said .
the judges added that brinkmann had aggravated his condition by drinking coca-cola .
" every consumer knows that coca-cola contains a not inconsiderable amount of sugar .
that can be discerned from the sugary taste of the drink , " said presiding judge mathias kirsten .
it was therefore up to the consumer to regulate his own intake of the drink .
brinkmann was claiming 5,620 euros -lrb- $ 7,140 -rrb- in damages and wanted coca-cola to pay the cost of his medical treatment .
he told the court that between 1994 and 1998 he drank around one liter of coca-cola a day and ate chocolate bars on a daily basis because of the " considerable burden " of his work .
he claimed he did not realise the risks of consuming coca-cola because the packaging was not clearly labelled .
he estimated he had been consuming 27 kilogrammes of pure sugar every year during that four-year period . dw-world.de german cola hopes to score big in america coca-cola is known and loved worldwide .

germany , the eurozone 's biggest economy , has been in breach of the deficit limit for the past three years and , despite government pledges to rein in the deficit , observers believe that the 2005 deficit ratio will again exceed 3.0 percent .
finance minister hans eichel nevertheless ruled out any additional belt-tightening measures to aid the cause .
" additional spending cuts do n't resolve anything ... but weigh on investment and on the economy , " the minister said .
" we 'll try to resolve -lrb- the budget problems -rrb- with a number of exceptional measures this year , " eichel added , without providing any details dw-world.de eu reviews stability pact sinners eu finance ministers at their meeting tuesday discussed the status of countries in violation of the stability and growth pact : while germany and greece seem to be improving , italy might face sanctions in the near future .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " friendly fans " may lose out in order to please pay tv and increase revenues , german soccer league dfl is considering changing kick-off times . the dfl is mulling whether to stagger kick-off times for bundesliga games held on weekends to get more lucrative offers for tv viewing rights , the league 's new business manager told german magazine sport bild this week . " we 're in a situation , and i say it quite clearly , in which nothing is ruled out , whether it is salami -lrb- split up -rrb- match schedules , changes to times or a change in the relationship between pay tv and free tv , " christian seifert , the dfl 's new business manager told sport bild . and while seifert declined to provide specifics , he said it was a necessary move to keep the league financially competitive . " it 's still a little bit early to talk about specific numbers , " he said .
" but -lrb- bayern munich chairman karl-heinz -rrb- rummenigge 's demand is absolutely right .
we have an outstanding product in the bundesliga , and we need an outstanding return . " more money , please seifert was referring to a recent call by rummenigge for the soccer league to seek 200 million -lrb- $ 256 million -rrb- more euros through negotiations for the tv rights later this year .
that would put the total cost at 500 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge -lrb- right -rrb- wants 200 million euros more currently , seven of the bundesliga games kick off at 3:30 p.m.
saturdays and two on 5:30 p.m.
sundays .
all of them are broadcast in their entirety on pay channel premiere , with match highlights available to public channels ard , zdf and dsf .
the current contracts expire at the end of the 2005-2006 season . the current initative would give the pay channels greater exclusivity , drawing higher advertising rates since the matches would be broadcast farther ahead of the free channels . most other major european soccer leagues have already tried fiddling with start times with some success - which has motivated seifert . " we do n't want to ignore the interest of the public , " he said .
" we know that the situation in germany is more ' fan friendly ' compared to other european countries that are much more oriented towards pay tv interests ...
this reservation has to be reviewed if if we see that it does n't produce the desired results . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is the bundesliga ?

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " friendly fans " may lose out in order to please pay tv and increase revenues , german soccer league dfl is considering changing kick-off times . the dfl is mulling whether to stagger kick-off times for bundesliga games held on weekends to get more lucrative offers for tv viewing rights , the league 's new business manager told german magazine sport bild this week . " we 're in a situation , and i say it quite clearly , in which nothing is ruled out , whether it is salami -lrb- split up -rrb- match schedules , changes to times or a change in the relationship between pay tv and free tv , " christian seifert , the dfl 's new business manager told sport bild . and while seifert declined to provide specifics , he said it was a necessary move to keep the league financially competitive . " it 's still a little bit early to talk about specific numbers , " he said .
" but -lrb- bayern munich chairman karl-heinz -rrb- rummenigge 's demand is absolutely right .
we have an outstanding product in the bundesliga , and we need an outstanding return . " more money , please seifert was referring to a recent call by rummenigge for the soccer league to seek 200 million -lrb- $ 256 million -rrb- more euros through negotiations for the tv rights later this year .
that would put the total cost at 500 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge -lrb- right -rrb- wants 200 million euros more currently , seven of the bundesliga games kick off at 3:30 p.m.
saturdays and two on 5:30 p.m.
sundays .
all of them are broadcast in their entirety on pay channel premiere , with match highlights available to public channels ard , zdf and dsf .
the current contracts expire at the end of the 2005-2006 season . the current initative would give the pay channels greater exclusivity , drawing higher advertising rates since the matches would be broadcast farther ahead of the free channels . most other major european soccer leagues have already tried fiddling with start times with some success - which has motivated seifert . " we do n't want to ignore the interest of the public , " he said .
" we know that the situation in germany is more ' fan friendly ' compared to other european countries that are much more oriented towards pay tv interests ...
this reservation has to be reviewed if if we see that it does n't produce the desired results . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is the bundesliga ?
the bundesliga is the name most people associate with the top league in german soccer but it is in fact the title given to a far-reaching net of organizations which support and promote the game all over germany .
-lrb- aug .
4 , 2004 -rrb- the real fight begins for german soccer clubs instead of looking forward to their summer holidays after a long season , germany 's soccer clubs are now bracing themselves for an even bigger challenge - their very survival .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .

" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .

not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .

they will also be held legally responsible in their adopted country - earlier attempts to open the service sector by applying the laws of a person ’ s native country failed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2005 easing workers ' mobility across the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but will their degrees be useful when they want to leave the country ?
traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bricklayer ?
that 's maurer to you !
" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .
" but german quality will become accepted and 150 german professions , from electrician to veterinarian to land surveyor . "
not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .
answer to local authorities even though their native qualifications are recognized , the new directive requires foreign workers to abide by the host country 's laws .
they will also be held legally responsible in their adopted country - earlier attempts to open the service sector by applying the laws of a person ’ s native country failed .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .

while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .

in order for the constitution to take effect , it must be ratified by all 25 member states . speaking in the bundestag on thursday , german chancellor gerhard schröder underlined the importance of germany voting in favor of the eu constitution , which is designed to define the powers and institutions of the eu , outline divisions of responsibility and streamline decision-making .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .

" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .
" but german quality will become accepted and 150 german professions , from electrician to veterinarian to land surveyor . "
not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .
answer to local authorities even though their native qualifications are recognized , the new directive requires foreign workers to abide by the host country 's laws .
they will also be held legally responsible in their adopted country - earlier attempts to open the service sector by applying the laws of a person ’ s native country failed .

while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .

"
he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .
" the memorial must not be allowed to become a cemetery or a shrine .
and if this happens , we jews will have to consider whether we can enter this place . " paul spiegel has already voiced his criticism of the memorial project , which he says does n't go far enough .
" by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " he said at the opening ceremony on tuesday . on those grounds , he added that the information center underneath the memorial site which documents the fate of europe 's jews was an " indispensable addition .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession . " in light of turkey 's accession negotiations , a new trial would be highly significant , " said german-kurdish member of the european parliament feleknas uca . rolf gössner , president of the league of human rights , agrees .
" the way this case is being dealt with is key to the credible development of human rights in turkey , " he told deutsche welle . no call for re-trial " a new trial is not explicitly ordered , " said ocalan 's lawyer marc müller , " but the judgement indicates that the court believes this is the best option . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to observers , ocalan would , in all likelihood , be convicted again .
" ocalan will be given the same sentence even if he is tried one hundred times , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gül -lrb- photo -rrb- this week . inhumane treatement arrested in kenya in 1999 amid public jubilation in turkey , ocalan was tried and condemned to capital punishment under a justice system now abolished by ankara as part of sweeping reforms to bring the country into line with eu entry conditions .
his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial . " the european commission expects that turkey will respect this decision of the court of human rights .
turkey is a member of the council of europe so it is a duty to implement all the decisions of the court , " an eu spokesman told reporters . turkey expressed discontent with the court ruling but said it would address the flaws in his conviction in a move that will help the country keep its eu membership bid on track .
a senior lawmaker from the governing justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , sadullah ergin , immediately branded the ruling " undesired , " while the party 's deputy chairman said turkey would take steps to fulfill its obligations .
" the turkish republic is a state based on the rule of law and will undertake the procedures that the law requires , " dengir mir mehmet firat told reporters in ankara . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court to hear öcalan appeal the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession . " in light of turkey 's accession negotiations , a new trial would be highly significant , " said german-kurdish member of the european parliament feleknas uca . rolf gössner , president of the league of human rights , agrees .
" the way this case is being dealt with is key to the credible development of human rights in turkey , " he told deutsche welle . no call for re-trial " a new trial is not explicitly ordered , " said ocalan 's lawyer marc müller , " but the judgement indicates that the court believes this is the best option . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to observers , ocalan would , in all likelihood , be convicted again .
" ocalan will be given the same sentence even if he is tried one hundred times , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gül -lrb- photo -rrb- this week . inhumane treatement arrested in kenya in 1999 amid public jubilation in turkey , ocalan was tried and condemned to capital punishment under a justice system now abolished by ankara as part of sweeping reforms to bring the country into line with eu entry conditions .
his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial . " the european commission expects that turkey will respect this decision of the court of human rights .
turkey is a member of the council of europe so it is a duty to implement all the decisions of the court , " an eu spokesman told reporters . turkey expressed discontent with the court ruling but said it would address the flaws in his conviction in a move that will help the country keep its eu membership bid on track .
a senior lawmaker from the governing justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , sadullah ergin , immediately branded the ruling " undesired , " while the party 's deputy chairman said turkey would take steps to fulfill its obligations .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .
but i think we are on the way to normal . " over time , germany developed into a reliable friend to israel , in addition to becoming a top trading partner .
and even though in the past , germany has n't played a strong role in the peace process , the country is becoming more active on this front , recognizing that its past gives it special obligations to help the jews . " one ca n't bury or forget the past , " former german chancellor helmut kohl once said .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .
but i think we are on the way to normal . " over time , germany developed into a reliable friend to israel , in addition to becoming a top trading partner .
and even though in the past , germany has n't played a strong role in the peace process , the country is becoming more active on this front , recognizing that its past gives it special obligations to help the jews . " one ca n't bury or forget the past , " former german chancellor helmut kohl once said .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession . " in light of turkey 's accession negotiations , a new trial would be highly significant , " said german-kurdish member of the european parliament feleknas uca . rolf gössner , president of the league of human rights , agrees .
" the way this case is being dealt with is key to the credible development of human rights in turkey , " he told deutsche welle . no call for re-trial " a new trial is not explicitly ordered , " said ocalan 's lawyer marc müller , " but the judgement indicates that the court believes this is the best option . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to observers , ocalan would , in all likelihood , be convicted again .
" ocalan will be given the same sentence even if he is tried one hundred times , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gül -lrb- photo -rrb- this week . inhumane treatement arrested in kenya in 1999 amid public jubilation in turkey , ocalan was tried and condemned to capital punishment under a justice system now abolished by ankara as part of sweeping reforms to bring the country into line with eu entry conditions .
his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial . " the european commission expects that turkey will respect this decision of the court of human rights .
turkey is a member of the council of europe so it is a duty to implement all the decisions of the court , " an eu spokesman told reporters . turkey expressed discontent with the court ruling but said it would address the flaws in his conviction in a move that will help the country keep its eu membership bid on track .
a senior lawmaker from the governing justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , sadullah ergin , immediately branded the ruling " undesired , " while the party 's deputy chairman said turkey would take steps to fulfill its obligations .
" the turkish republic is a state based on the rule of law and will undertake the procedures that the law requires , " dengir mir mehmet firat told reporters in ankara . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court to hear öcalan appeal the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .

"
he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .
" the memorial must not be allowed to become a cemetery or a shrine .
and if this happens , we jews will have to consider whether we can enter this place . " paul spiegel has already voiced his criticism of the memorial project , which he says does n't go far enough .
" by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " he said at the opening ceremony on tuesday . on those grounds , he added that the information center underneath the memorial site which documents the fate of europe 's jews was an " indispensable addition .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession . " in light of turkey 's accession negotiations , a new trial would be highly significant , " said german-kurdish member of the european parliament feleknas uca . rolf gössner , president of the league of human rights , agrees .
" the way this case is being dealt with is key to the credible development of human rights in turkey , " he told deutsche welle . no call for re-trial " a new trial is not explicitly ordered , " said ocalan 's lawyer marc müller , " but the judgement indicates that the court believes this is the best option . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to observers , ocalan would , in all likelihood , be convicted again .
" ocalan will be given the same sentence even if he is tried one hundred times , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gül -lrb- photo -rrb- this week . inhumane treatement arrested in kenya in 1999 amid public jubilation in turkey , ocalan was tried and condemned to capital punishment under a justice system now abolished by ankara as part of sweeping reforms to bring the country into line with eu entry conditions .
his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial . " the european commission expects that turkey will respect this decision of the court of human rights .
turkey is a member of the council of europe so it is a duty to implement all the decisions of the court , " an eu spokesman told reporters . turkey expressed discontent with the court ruling but said it would address the flaws in his conviction in a move that will help the country keep its eu membership bid on track .
a senior lawmaker from the governing justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , sadullah ergin , immediately branded the ruling " undesired , " while the party 's deputy chairman said turkey would take steps to fulfill its obligations .
" the turkish republic is a state based on the rule of law and will undertake the procedures that the law requires , " dengir mir mehmet firat told reporters in ankara . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court to hear öcalan appeal the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .

but now , following several rulings by the world trade organization , the european union is obliged to change this system by jan .
1 next year - much to the dismay of producers the world over . the " banana war , " as it has become commonly known , has been generating heat for the past decade . there are two main factions : the europeans , who give preferential treatment to their former colonies -lrb- acp states -rrb- by guaranteeing them generous european quotas , and the south american producers who dominate the us market . so-called " dollar bananas " are substantially cheaper than the acp ones , but there is a limit to how many can currently be exported to european soil .
those that are exported are stung with a duty charge . encouraging cheap production but the world trade organization has ruled that that should all change .
karl-friedrich falkenberg , who heads the trade directorate of the european commission , said the new ruling would increase the drive towards cheap mass production . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banana production in colombia " those who produce more cheaply will have the chance to sell more , " he said .
" these historic rights will dissolve and the more competitive will get a bigger share of the world market . " from 2006 , the present quota and duty system will be replaced by a duty only system with no limit on volume .

the poverty in central america , where more than three million people depend on the banana trade , would get even worse .
but africans would also get poorer because the companies are only interested in absolutely inefficient social standards . " international non-governmental organizations share this worry .
for years they 've been complaining about a race for the lowest standards in the banana trade , and because too many bananas are being produced , prices and social conditions are falling .
bettina burkert of the banafair organization said the new eu rules would speed up the race . " we are calling on the eu to put a moratorium on the move , so instead of it coming into effect next january , research could be conducted into how it would affect south american and caribbean producers , " she said . various interest groups are demanding a differentiated system in which the level of import duty would depend upon whether the bananas were produced in a socially fair and ecologically sound way . but karl-friedrich falkenberg said he does n't believe that such regulations would augment the fairness of the banana trade . " much is down to the consumers , " he said " if they go for the cheapest bananas , they 'll be buying the ones produced under the worst social conditions .

while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .
" the german ratification process is a stitch-up , " he said .
" the politicians are simply going ahead with its implementation .

-lrb- ap photo / claude paris -rrb- while other european nations have been mulling over the pros and cons of the eu constitution in recent months , berlin has managed to sweep the issue under the carpet . " if we were to hold a general knowledge quiz about the contents of the european constitution in france and germany , " pointed out huffschmid , " germany would come out of it pretty badly . " " not even the media are paying any attention to the matter , " said janis .
a. emmanouilidis , eu expert at the munich center for applied political research and an advisor at the foreign ministry 's european department . " the best compromise " berlin 's vote comes one day after austria 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the charter - with its upper house expected to approve the treaty right before france holds its hotly-contested referendum on may 29 . slovakia also approved the constitution wednesday , bringing the number of states to have approved the treaty up to seven .
in order for the constitution to take effect , it must be ratified by all 25 member states . speaking in the bundestag on thursday , german chancellor gerhard schröder underlined the importance of germany voting in favor of the eu constitution , which is designed to define the powers and institutions of the eu , outline divisions of responsibility and streamline decision-making . " i ask you not to be too petty or too obsessed with the detail of the odd half sentence that may not completely meet our expectations , " said schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian tricolor and european union flags are seen on at the side entrance of the renovated berlaymont commission building in brussels , thursday oct.21 , 2004 .
eu commission president romano prodi inaugurated the renovated berlaymont building which will become the home of the european union 's head office after years of scandal and chaos surrounding the restoration .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the charter makes some changes in leadership - the commission president will continue to lead the body responsible for proposing and executing eu laws .
but the european council will now elect a president for a two-and-a-half year term , renewable once .
the current system of rotating the presidency every six months will be discontinued .
the constitution also establishes the new position of foreign minister , who will speak on the eu 's behalf on agreed common policy . " the constitution is not perfect , but it 's the best compromise we were able to reach , " said emmanouilidis .
" it makes the eu more effective and more democratic . " concerns but it 's not without its critics .
" german concerns have risen with reports of organized crime and wage-undercutting from eastward expansion at a time when the german economy is not doing well , " said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute , in an interview with reuters news agency . while the majority of germans say they support the treaty , the general image of the brussels administration within germany has seen better days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press has been quick to highlight tales of local workers losing out to cheaper eastern european arrivals , while chancellor schröder 's repeated run-ins with brussels reflect popular disapproval of a series of eu plans . together with french president jacques chirac , schröder has been an outspoken critic of the eu 's services directive , which germans fear will allow eastern european service firms to undercut them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2005 easing workers ' mobility across the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but will their degrees be useful when they want to leave the country ?
traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bricklayer ?
that 's maurer to you !
" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .
" but german quality will become accepted and 150 german professions , from electrician to veterinarian to land surveyor . "
not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .
answer to local authorities even though their native qualifications are recognized , the new directive requires foreign workers to abide by the host country 's laws .
they will also be held legally responsible in their adopted country - earlier attempts to open the service sector by applying the laws of a person ’ s native country failed .
" the proposed guidelines for the recognition of professional qualifications strike a good balance between permitting freedom of movement and consumer protection , " rühle said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2005 easing workers ' mobility across the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but will their degrees be useful when they want to leave the country ?
traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bricklayer ?
that 's maurer to you !
" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .
" but german quality will become accepted and 150 german professions , from electrician to veterinarian to land surveyor . "
not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .
answer to local authorities even though their native qualifications are recognized , the new directive requires foreign workers to abide by the host country 's laws .
they will also be held legally responsible in their adopted country - earlier attempts to open the service sector by applying the laws of a person ’ s native country failed .
" the proposed guidelines for the recognition of professional qualifications strike a good balance between permitting freedom of movement and consumer protection , " rühle said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bricklayer ?
that 's maurer to you !
" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .
" but german quality will become accepted and 150 german professions , from electrician to veterinarian to land surveyor . "
not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .
answer to local authorities even though their native qualifications are recognized , the new directive requires foreign workers to abide by the host country 's laws .
they will also be held legally responsible in their adopted country - earlier attempts to open the service sector by applying the laws of a person ’ s native country failed .
" the proposed guidelines for the recognition of professional qualifications strike a good balance between permitting freedom of movement and consumer protection , " rühle said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bricklayer ?
that 's maurer to you !
" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .
" but german quality will become accepted and 150 german professions , from electrician to veterinarian to land surveyor . "
not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .
answer to local authorities even though their native qualifications are recognized , the new directive requires foreign workers to abide by the host country 's laws .
they will also be held legally responsible in their adopted country - earlier attempts to open the service sector by applying the laws of a person ’ s native country failed .
" the proposed guidelines for the recognition of professional qualifications strike a good balance between permitting freedom of movement and consumer protection , " rühle said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .
but i think we are on the way to normal . " over time , germany developed into a reliable friend to israel , in addition to becoming a top trading partner .
and even though in the past , germany has n't played a strong role in the peace process , the country is becoming more active on this front , recognizing that its past gives it special obligations to help the jews . " one ca n't bury or forget the past , " former german chancellor helmut kohl once said .
" because a people that does n't know its past , ca n't understand the present and ca n't construct the future .

for years they 've been complaining about a race for the lowest standards in the banana trade , and because too many bananas are being produced , prices and social conditions are falling .
bettina burkert of the banafair organization said the new eu rules would speed up the race . " we are calling on the eu to put a moratorium on the move , so instead of it coming into effect next january , research could be conducted into how it would affect south american and caribbean producers , " she said . various interest groups are demanding a differentiated system in which the level of import duty would depend upon whether the bananas were produced in a socially fair and ecologically sound way . but karl-friedrich falkenberg said he does n't believe that such regulations would augment the fairness of the banana trade .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .
but i think we are on the way to normal . " over time , germany developed into a reliable friend to israel , in addition to becoming a top trading partner .
and even though in the past , germany has n't played a strong role in the peace process , the country is becoming more active on this front , recognizing that its past gives it special obligations to help the jews . " one ca n't bury or forget the past , " former german chancellor helmut kohl once said .
" because a people that does n't know its past , ca n't understand the present and ca n't construct the future .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .
but i think we are on the way to normal . " over time , germany developed into a reliable friend to israel , in addition to becoming a top trading partner .
and even though in the past , germany has n't played a strong role in the peace process , the country is becoming more active on this front , recognizing that its past gives it special obligations to help the jews . " one ca n't bury or forget the past , " former german chancellor helmut kohl once said .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " friendly fans " may lose out in order to please pay tv and increase revenues , german soccer league dfl is considering changing kick-off times . the dfl is mulling whether to stagger kick-off times for bundesliga games held on weekends to get more lucrative offers for tv viewing rights , the league 's new business manager told german magazine sport bild this week . " we 're in a situation , and i say it quite clearly , in which nothing is ruled out , whether it is salami -lrb- split up -rrb- match schedules , changes to times or a change in the relationship between pay tv and free tv , " christian seifert , the dfl 's new business manager told sport bild . and while seifert declined to provide specifics , he said it was a necessary move to keep the league financially competitive . " it 's still a little bit early to talk about specific numbers , " he said .
" but -lrb- bayern munich chairman karl-heinz -rrb- rummenigge 's demand is absolutely right .
we have an outstanding product in the bundesliga , and we need an outstanding return . " more money , please seifert was referring to a recent call by rummenigge for the soccer league to seek 200 million -lrb- $ 256 million -rrb- more euros through negotiations for the tv rights later this year .
that would put the total cost at 500 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge -lrb- right -rrb- wants 200 million euros more currently , seven of the bundesliga games kick off at 3:30 p.m.
saturdays and two on 5:30 p.m.
sundays .
all of them are broadcast in their entirety on pay channel premiere , with match highlights available to public channels ard , zdf and dsf .
the current contracts expire at the end of the 2005-2006 season . the current initative would give the pay channels greater exclusivity , drawing higher advertising rates since the matches would be broadcast farther ahead of the free channels . most other major european soccer leagues have already tried fiddling with start times with some success - which has motivated seifert . " we do n't want to ignore the interest of the public , " he said .
" we know that the situation in germany is more ' fan friendly ' compared to other european countries that are much more oriented towards pay tv interests ...
this reservation has to be reviewed if if we see that it does n't produce the desired results . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is the bundesliga ?
the bundesliga is the name most people associate with the top league in german soccer but it is in fact the title given to a far-reaching net of organizations which support and promote the game all over germany .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .

" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bricklayer ?
that 's maurer to you !
" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .
" but german quality will become accepted and 150 german professions , from electrician to veterinarian to land surveyor . "
not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .
answer to local authorities even though their native qualifications are recognized , the new directive requires foreign workers to abide by the host country 's laws .
they will also be held legally responsible in their adopted country - earlier attempts to open the service sector by applying the laws of a person ’ s native country failed .
" the proposed guidelines for the recognition of professional qualifications strike a good balance between permitting freedom of movement and consumer protection , " rühle said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doctors defect to blissful britain germany 's health system is a troubled soul .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .
but i think we are on the way to normal . " over time , germany developed into a reliable friend to israel , in addition to becoming a top trading partner .
and even though in the past , germany has n't played a strong role in the peace process , the country is becoming more active on this front , recognizing that its past gives it special obligations to help the jews . " one ca n't bury or forget the past , " former german chancellor helmut kohl once said .

while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .
" the german ratification process is a stitch-up , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2005 germany approves eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was supported by government and opposition german parliamentarians overwhelmingly approved the eu constitution on thursday .
while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .
" the german ratification process is a stitch-up , " he said .
" the politicians are simply going ahead with its implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker put up posters that read " europe deserves a yes " , in reference to the upcoming referendum in france , on the eu constitution in the southern city of marseilles , france , wednesday , may 4 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / claude paris -rrb- while other european nations have been mulling over the pros and cons of the eu constitution in recent months , berlin has managed to sweep the issue under the carpet . " if we were to hold a general knowledge quiz about the contents of the european constitution in france and germany , " pointed out huffschmid , " germany would come out of it pretty badly . " " not even the media are paying any attention to the matter , " said janis .
a. emmanouilidis , eu expert at the munich center for applied political research and an advisor at the foreign ministry 's european department . " the best compromise " berlin 's vote comes one day after austria 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the charter - with its upper house expected to approve the treaty right before france holds its hotly-contested referendum on may 29 . slovakia also approved the constitution wednesday , bringing the number of states to have approved the treaty up to seven .
in order for the constitution to take effect , it must be ratified by all 25 member states . speaking in the bundestag on thursday , german chancellor gerhard schröder underlined the importance of germany voting in favor of the eu constitution , which is designed to define the powers and institutions of the eu , outline divisions of responsibility and streamline decision-making . " i ask you not to be too petty or too obsessed with the detail of the odd half sentence that may not completely meet our expectations , " said schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian tricolor and european union flags are seen on at the side entrance of the renovated berlaymont commission building in brussels , thursday oct.21 , 2004 .
eu commission president romano prodi inaugurated the renovated berlaymont building which will become the home of the european union 's head office after years of scandal and chaos surrounding the restoration .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the charter makes some changes in leadership - the commission president will continue to lead the body responsible for proposing and executing eu laws .
but the european council will now elect a president for a two-and-a-half year term , renewable once .
the current system of rotating the presidency every six months will be discontinued .
the constitution also establishes the new position of foreign minister , who will speak on the eu 's behalf on agreed common policy . " the constitution is not perfect , but it 's the best compromise we were able to reach , " said emmanouilidis .

he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession . " in light of turkey 's accession negotiations , a new trial would be highly significant , " said german-kurdish member of the european parliament feleknas uca . rolf gössner , president of the league of human rights , agrees .
" the way this case is being dealt with is key to the credible development of human rights in turkey , " he told deutsche welle . no call for re-trial " a new trial is not explicitly ordered , " said ocalan 's lawyer marc müller , " but the judgement indicates that the court believes this is the best option . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to observers , ocalan would , in all likelihood , be convicted again .
" ocalan will be given the same sentence even if he is tried one hundred times , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gül -lrb- photo -rrb- this week . inhumane treatement arrested in kenya in 1999 amid public jubilation in turkey , ocalan was tried and condemned to capital punishment under a justice system now abolished by ankara as part of sweeping reforms to bring the country into line with eu entry conditions .
his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial . " the european commission expects that turkey will respect this decision of the court of human rights .
turkey is a member of the council of europe so it is a duty to implement all the decisions of the court , " an eu spokesman told reporters . turkey expressed discontent with the court ruling but said it would address the flaws in his conviction in a move that will help the country keep its eu membership bid on track .
a senior lawmaker from the governing justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , sadullah ergin , immediately branded the ruling " undesired , " while the party 's deputy chairman said turkey would take steps to fulfill its obligations .
" the turkish republic is a state based on the rule of law and will undertake the procedures that the law requires , " dengir mir mehmet firat told reporters in ankara . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court to hear öcalan appeal the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .

for years they 've been complaining about a race for the lowest standards in the banana trade , and because too many bananas are being produced , prices and social conditions are falling .
bettina burkert of the banafair organization said the new eu rules would speed up the race . " we are calling on the eu to put a moratorium on the move , so instead of it coming into effect next january , research could be conducted into how it would affect south american and caribbean producers , " she said . various interest groups are demanding a differentiated system in which the level of import duty would depend upon whether the bananas were produced in a socially fair and ecologically sound way . but karl-friedrich falkenberg said he does n't believe that such regulations would augment the fairness of the banana trade .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession .

his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial . " the european commission expects that turkey will respect this decision of the court of human rights .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " friendly fans " may lose out in order to please pay tv and increase revenues , german soccer league dfl is considering changing kick-off times . the dfl is mulling whether to stagger kick-off times for bundesliga games held on weekends to get more lucrative offers for tv viewing rights , the league 's new business manager told german magazine sport bild this week . " we 're in a situation , and i say it quite clearly , in which nothing is ruled out , whether it is salami -lrb- split up -rrb- match schedules , changes to times or a change in the relationship between pay tv and free tv , " christian seifert , the dfl 's new business manager told sport bild . and while seifert declined to provide specifics , he said it was a necessary move to keep the league financially competitive . " it 's still a little bit early to talk about specific numbers , " he said .
" but -lrb- bayern munich chairman karl-heinz -rrb- rummenigge 's demand is absolutely right .
we have an outstanding product in the bundesliga , and we need an outstanding return . " more money , please seifert was referring to a recent call by rummenigge for the soccer league to seek 200 million -lrb- $ 256 million -rrb- more euros through negotiations for the tv rights later this year .
that would put the total cost at 500 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge -lrb- right -rrb- wants 200 million euros more currently , seven of the bundesliga games kick off at 3:30 p.m.
saturdays and two on 5:30 p.m.
sundays .
all of them are broadcast in their entirety on pay channel premiere , with match highlights available to public channels ard , zdf and dsf .
the current contracts expire at the end of the 2005-2006 season . the current initative would give the pay channels greater exclusivity , drawing higher advertising rates since the matches would be broadcast farther ahead of the free channels . most other major european soccer leagues have already tried fiddling with start times with some success - which has motivated seifert . " we do n't want to ignore the interest of the public , " he said .
" we know that the situation in germany is more ' fan friendly ' compared to other european countries that are much more oriented towards pay tv interests ...
this reservation has to be reviewed if if we see that it does n't produce the desired results . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what is the bundesliga ?
the bundesliga is the name most people associate with the top league in german soccer but it is in fact the title given to a far-reaching net of organizations which support and promote the game all over germany .
-lrb- aug .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2005 easing workers ' mobility across the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but will their degrees be useful when they want to leave the country ?
traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .

individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .

traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

but now , following several rulings by the world trade organization , the european union is obliged to change this system by jan .
1 next year - much to the dismay of producers the world over . the " banana war , " as it has become commonly known , has been generating heat for the past decade . there are two main factions : the europeans , who give preferential treatment to their former colonies -lrb- acp states -rrb- by guaranteeing them generous european quotas , and the south american producers who dominate the us market . so-called " dollar bananas " are substantially cheaper than the acp ones , but there is a limit to how many can currently be exported to european soil .
those that are exported are stung with a duty charge . encouraging cheap production but the world trade organization has ruled that that should all change .
karl-friedrich falkenberg , who heads the trade directorate of the european commission , said the new ruling would increase the drive towards cheap mass production . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banana production in colombia " those who produce more cheaply will have the chance to sell more , " he said .
" these historic rights will dissolve and the more competitive will get a bigger share of the world market . " from 2006 , the present quota and duty system will be replaced by a duty only system with no limit on volume .

for years they 've been complaining about a race for the lowest standards in the banana trade , and because too many bananas are being produced , prices and social conditions are falling .
bettina burkert of the banafair organization said the new eu rules would speed up the race .

but now , following several rulings by the world trade organization , the european union is obliged to change this system by jan .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

europe on thursday warned iran of " consequences " if tehran resumed nuclear activities it suspended under a deal with eu negotiators last year , as diplomats hurried into talks to avert a fresh crisis . a european diplomat told afp news service that iran had received a letter from britain , france and germany warning of " consequences if they restart conversion activities . " the letter also " proposes a four-way meeting in the near future . " we hope the iranians will reconsider , " one diplomat said , adding that the letter was delivered to iran on tuesday or wednesday . france urged iran to think again and to maintain negotiations . " we reaffirm our attachment to the paris agreement of november 2004 , which envisages the suspension of activities linked to the enrichment and treatment -lrb- of uranium -rrb- ... and we call for more discussions , " the foreign ministry said in paris . blair would support security council action britain would back un security council action against iran if the country breaks it pledges over its nuclear program , prime minister tony blair said thursday . " let 's wait and see what actually happens , " blair said at a press conference when quizzed about a response to iran 's threats .
" but we certainly will support referral to the un security council if iran breaches its undertakings and obligations .
quite how that will come about we have got to work out with our colleagues and allies .
but those international rules are there for a reason , and they have to be adhered to . " a top iranian nuclear official had said earlier thursday the country could soon announce the resumption of " a noticeable part " of uranium conversion work , a precursor to uranium enrichment . tehran no longer respects treaty and iran 's isna agency quoted hassan rowhani , the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiator , as saying tehran would " no longer have any respect " for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- if it was prevented from using atomic technology and the full nuclear cycle for peaceful purposes . iran 's enrichment program is the focus of international fears that the clerical regime is seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it only wants to make atomic energy reactor fuel . but the watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- said it hoped intense last-minute talks with iran would dissuade tehran . " i know there was a lot of diplomacy last night , " a western diplomat said on customary condition of anonymity . ongoing discussions top iranian negotiator cyrus nasseri told afp by telephone from vienna that " discussions " were ongoing . iran agreed in the november deal with european union members britain , france and germany to suspend its uranium enrichment work , including conversion , as a " confidence building " gesture . the diplomat said it was not certain that the iaea would receive a letter from iran announcing the resumption of the work on thursday . the source pointed at a report in the washington post that iranian officials had decided to hold off on notifying the vienna-based iaea and were considering an offer to restart talks in the next two weeks . according to that report , the three eu countries have notified tehran that they will abandon talks and support a us strategy for punitive measures against iran if it resumes the nuclear activity . russia will continue cooperating with iran a russian nuclear official said iran 's intention to restart the sensitive activities was " legitimate " and would not alter russia 's nuclear cooperation with the islamic state . " the fact that iran has restarted conversion will not have an impact on nuclear cooperation between russia and iran , " said the official , speaking to afp on condition of anonymity . " this does not threaten international security because this uranium will be used for peaceful ends and under the strict iaea control , " the official said . " it is legitimate and legal , " she said , adding that differences between russia and the united states regarding moscow 's nuclear cooperation with iran were " narrowing . " under the accord between russia and iran signed in february , russia is to send nearly 100 tonnes of fuel to iran in several consignments under iaea supervision . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany warns iran over nuclear program germany warned on monday that iran 's threat to defy the west and resume uranium enrichment activities which could be used to make nuclear weapons would torpedo talks between the european union and tehran .
-lrb- may 2 , 2005 -rrb- iran may defy eu nuclear suspension deal iran is unhappy with the progress of nuclear negotiations with the european union and may resume uranium conversion activities next week in defiance of a key agreement , senior officials warned saturday .
-lrb- april 30 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2005 germany approves eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was supported by government and opposition german parliamentarians overwhelmingly approved the eu constitution on thursday .
while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .
" the german ratification process is a stitch-up , " he said .
" the politicians are simply going ahead with its implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker put up posters that read " europe deserves a yes " , in reference to the upcoming referendum in france , on the eu constitution in the southern city of marseilles , france , wednesday , may 4 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / claude paris -rrb- while other european nations have been mulling over the pros and cons of the eu constitution in recent months , berlin has managed to sweep the issue under the carpet . " if we were to hold a general knowledge quiz about the contents of the european constitution in france and germany , " pointed out huffschmid , " germany would come out of it pretty badly . " " not even the media are paying any attention to the matter , " said janis .
a. emmanouilidis , eu expert at the munich center for applied political research and an advisor at the foreign ministry 's european department . " the best compromise " berlin 's vote comes one day after austria 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the charter - with its upper house expected to approve the treaty right before france holds its hotly-contested referendum on may 29 . slovakia also approved the constitution wednesday , bringing the number of states to have approved the treaty up to seven .
in order for the constitution to take effect , it must be ratified by all 25 member states . speaking in the bundestag on thursday , german chancellor gerhard schröder underlined the importance of germany voting in favor of the eu constitution , which is designed to define the powers and institutions of the eu , outline divisions of responsibility and streamline decision-making . " i ask you not to be too petty or too obsessed with the detail of the odd half sentence that may not completely meet our expectations , " said schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian tricolor and european union flags are seen on at the side entrance of the renovated berlaymont commission building in brussels , thursday oct.21 , 2004 .
eu commission president romano prodi inaugurated the renovated berlaymont building which will become the home of the european union 's head office after years of scandal and chaos surrounding the restoration .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the charter makes some changes in leadership - the commission president will continue to lead the body responsible for proposing and executing eu laws .
but the european council will now elect a president for a two-and-a-half year term , renewable once .
the current system of rotating the presidency every six months will be discontinued .
the constitution also establishes the new position of foreign minister , who will speak on the eu 's behalf on agreed common policy . " the constitution is not perfect , but it 's the best compromise we were able to reach , " said emmanouilidis .
" it makes the eu more effective and more democratic . " concerns but it 's not without its critics .
" german concerns have risen with reports of organized crime and wage-undercutting from eastward expansion at a time when the german economy is not doing well , " said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute , in an interview with reuters news agency . while the majority of germans say they support the treaty , the general image of the brussels administration within germany has seen better days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press has been quick to highlight tales of local workers losing out to cheaper eastern european arrivals , while chancellor schröder 's repeated run-ins with brussels reflect popular disapproval of a series of eu plans . together with french president jacques chirac , schröder has been an outspoken critic of the eu 's services directive , which germans fear will allow eastern european service firms to undercut them .
berlin says its contributions to the eu budget subsidize lower corporate tax among new entrants and put german jobs at risk , promoting calls for harmonized tax rates . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders make joint appeal ahead of eu vote with just over a month to go before skeptical french voters cast their ballots on the eu constitution , president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder joined forces tuesday to back the treaty .
-lrb- april 27 , 2005 -rrb- poll says germans support eu constitution the german parliament will decide on the fate of the new eu constitution on thursday .
the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public .
-lrb- may 10 , 2005 -rrb- eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2005 germany approves eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution was supported by government and opposition german parliamentarians overwhelmingly approved the eu constitution on thursday .
while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany . with 569 yes votes , 23 no votes and two abstentions , the german bundestag approved the new european union constitution . the result masks growing public unease at the eu 's direction .
but reservations about the constitution have failed to gain momentum , partially due to widespread ignorance of its finer points . the anti-globalization activist group attac has now launched a campaign entitled " europe : no to the eu constitution treaty ; yes to a social , democratic and peaceful europe , " which it hopes will boost public awareness of an issue that has so far gone largely ignored . one of its signatories is jörg huffschmid , director of the institute for european economics and social policy -lrb- ewig -rrb- at bremen university .
" the german ratification process is a stitch-up , " he said .
" the politicians are simply going ahead with its implementation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker put up posters that read " europe deserves a yes " , in reference to the upcoming referendum in france , on the eu constitution in the southern city of marseilles , france , wednesday , may 4 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / claude paris -rrb- while other european nations have been mulling over the pros and cons of the eu constitution in recent months , berlin has managed to sweep the issue under the carpet . " if we were to hold a general knowledge quiz about the contents of the european constitution in france and germany , " pointed out huffschmid , " germany would come out of it pretty badly . " " not even the media are paying any attention to the matter , " said janis .
a. emmanouilidis , eu expert at the munich center for applied political research and an advisor at the foreign ministry 's european department . " the best compromise " berlin 's vote comes one day after austria 's lower house of parliament voted overwhelmingly for the charter - with its upper house expected to approve the treaty right before france holds its hotly-contested referendum on may 29 . slovakia also approved the constitution wednesday , bringing the number of states to have approved the treaty up to seven .
in order for the constitution to take effect , it must be ratified by all 25 member states . speaking in the bundestag on thursday , german chancellor gerhard schröder underlined the importance of germany voting in favor of the eu constitution , which is designed to define the powers and institutions of the eu , outline divisions of responsibility and streamline decision-making . " i ask you not to be too petty or too obsessed with the detail of the odd half sentence that may not completely meet our expectations , " said schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian tricolor and european union flags are seen on at the side entrance of the renovated berlaymont commission building in brussels , thursday oct.21 , 2004 .
eu commission president romano prodi inaugurated the renovated berlaymont building which will become the home of the european union 's head office after years of scandal and chaos surrounding the restoration .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the charter makes some changes in leadership - the commission president will continue to lead the body responsible for proposing and executing eu laws .
but the european council will now elect a president for a two-and-a-half year term , renewable once .
the current system of rotating the presidency every six months will be discontinued .
the constitution also establishes the new position of foreign minister , who will speak on the eu 's behalf on agreed common policy . " the constitution is not perfect , but it 's the best compromise we were able to reach , " said emmanouilidis .
" it makes the eu more effective and more democratic . " concerns but it 's not without its critics .
" german concerns have risen with reports of organized crime and wage-undercutting from eastward expansion at a time when the german economy is not doing well , " said henrik uterwedde , deputy director of the german-french institute , in an interview with reuters news agency . while the majority of germans say they support the treaty , the general image of the brussels administration within germany has seen better days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the press has been quick to highlight tales of local workers losing out to cheaper eastern european arrivals , while chancellor schröder 's repeated run-ins with brussels reflect popular disapproval of a series of eu plans . together with french president jacques chirac , schröder has been an outspoken critic of the eu 's services directive , which germans fear will allow eastern european service firms to undercut them .
berlin says its contributions to the eu budget subsidize lower corporate tax among new entrants and put german jobs at risk , promoting calls for harmonized tax rates . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders make joint appeal ahead of eu vote with just over a month to go before skeptical french voters cast their ballots on the eu constitution , president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder joined forces tuesday to back the treaty .

the latest opinion poll shows the document gets strong backing from the german public .
-lrb- may 10 , 2005 -rrb- eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " friendly fans " may lose out in order to please pay tv and increase revenues , german soccer league dfl is considering changing kick-off times . the dfl is mulling whether to stagger kick-off times for bundesliga games held on weekends to get more lucrative offers for tv viewing rights , the league 's new business manager told german magazine sport bild this week . " we 're in a situation , and i say it quite clearly , in which nothing is ruled out , whether it is salami -lrb- split up -rrb- match schedules , changes to times or a change in the relationship between pay tv and free tv , " christian seifert , the dfl 's new business manager told sport bild . and while seifert declined to provide specifics , he said it was a necessary move to keep the league financially competitive . " it 's still a little bit early to talk about specific numbers , " he said .
" but -lrb- bayern munich chairman karl-heinz -rrb- rummenigge 's demand is absolutely right .
we have an outstanding product in the bundesliga , and we need an outstanding return . " more money , please seifert was referring to a recent call by rummenigge for the soccer league to seek 200 million -lrb- $ 256 million -rrb- more euros through negotiations for the tv rights later this year .
that would put the total cost at 500 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge -lrb- right -rrb- wants 200 million euros more currently , seven of the bundesliga games kick off at 3:30 p.m.
saturdays and two on 5:30 p.m.
sundays .

while they have been characterized as peaceful and relaxed , " normal " relations are still far away . former german chancellor willy brandt in 1973 once described the west german-israeli relationship as one with a " special character " with " no neutrality in the heart or in the conscience . " then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .
but their friendship essentially began in 1960 , when israel-founder david ben gurion and then german chancellor konrad adenauer met in new york -lrb- photo -rrb- . adenauer wanted to expand contacts to include an exchange of ambassadors but israel rejected the idea .
only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .
but israel did set up a " trade mission " in cologne , which was mainly tasked with using reparations money to buy german goods needed by the young state . a stand-off in the 1960s , however , after word got out that israel was buying weapons from west germany , bonn started to worry about the effects on its relationship to the arab world .
indeed , egyptian president nasser invited the east german president to cairo in 1965 .
bonn reacted by offering israel diplomatic relations - despite the fact that nasser threatened such a move would cause egypt to recognize east germany . though nasser was bluffing , most arab states broke off relations with bonn when , on may 12 , 1965 , israel and west germany exchanged ambassadors for the first time .
soon after , a west german embassy opened in tel aviv and an israeli one opened in bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asher ben natan a former member of the israeli defense ministry who had been involved in weapons deals with west germany , asher ben natan -lrb- photo -rrb- , was sent to the rhein as the country 's first ambassador .
shortly after his arrival in cologne , ben natan stressed the importance of relations between the two countries . " the young are not responsible for the deeds of their fathers , " he said .
" the young should know what happened .
the young in both countries should try to build a better future together . " great but not normal the arab states eventually sent their ambassadors back to bonn .
in israel , too , the relationship to germany was becoming increasingly accepted . yohanan meroz , then director of the israeli foreign ministry and later ambassador to germany described the relationship as " great but not normal . " in later years he explained what he meant : " i believe that the relationship has largely been normalized without being normal .
but i think we are on the way to normal . " over time , germany developed into a reliable friend to israel , in addition to becoming a top trading partner .
and even though in the past , germany has n't played a strong role in the peace process , the country is becoming more active on this front , recognizing that its past gives it special obligations to help the jews . " one ca n't bury or forget the past , " former german chancellor helmut kohl once said .

turkey blames the leader of the pkk for the 15-year war between his kurdish separatist group and turkish security forces in the south-east of the country , which claimed some 30,000 lives . repercussions for eu bid although not binding , the strasbourg ruling puts pressure on ankara to give ocalan a retrial - a move bound to stir up controversy ahead of turkey 's bid for eu accession . " in light of turkey 's accession negotiations , a new trial would be highly significant , " said german-kurdish member of the european parliament feleknas uca . rolf gössner , president of the league of human rights , agrees .
" the way this case is being dealt with is key to the credible development of human rights in turkey , " he told deutsche welle . no call for re-trial " a new trial is not explicitly ordered , " said ocalan 's lawyer marc müller , " but the judgement indicates that the court believes this is the best option . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but according to observers , ocalan would , in all likelihood , be convicted again .
" ocalan will be given the same sentence even if he is tried one hundred times , " said turkish foreign minister abdullah gül -lrb- photo -rrb- this week . inhumane treatement arrested in kenya in 1999 amid public jubilation in turkey , ocalan was tried and condemned to capital punishment under a justice system now abolished by ankara as part of sweeping reforms to bring the country into line with eu entry conditions .
his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when turkey scrapped the death penalty in 2002 , in line with eu requirements . the court in strasbourg confirmed an earlier ruling that the trial was unfair , because a military judge was present for some of the hearings , ocalan only had restricted access to his lawyers , and he was treated inhumanely while in custody . grudging respect for ruling the european union said it expects turkey to respect the ruling on ocalan 's trial . " the european commission expects that turkey will respect this decision of the court of human rights .
turkey is a member of the council of europe so it is a duty to implement all the decisions of the court , " an eu spokesman told reporters . turkey expressed discontent with the court ruling but said it would address the flaws in his conviction in a move that will help the country keep its eu membership bid on track .
a senior lawmaker from the governing justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , sadullah ergin , immediately branded the ruling " undesired , " while the party 's deputy chairman said turkey would take steps to fulfill its obligations .
" the turkish republic is a state based on the rule of law and will undertake the procedures that the law requires , " dengir mir mehmet firat told reporters in ankara . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european court to hear öcalan appeal the european court of human rights this week takes up the fate of kurdish leader abdullah öcalan .

"
he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .
" the memorial must not be allowed to become a cemetery or a shrine .
and if this happens , we jews will have to consider whether we can enter this place . " paul spiegel has already voiced his criticism of the memorial project , which he says does n't go far enough .
" by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " he said at the opening ceremony on tuesday . on those grounds , he added that the information center underneath the memorial site which documents the fate of europe 's jews was an " indispensable addition .

" then , official diplomatic relations between the two countries had only been established for eight years . these days , germany is israel 's most important political ally and trade partner in europe and only second to the us in the world .
and beyond politics , the two nations have established close personal networks and a cultural relationship that has infused the " special relationship " with life . but it was a long road to get there . too soon after auschwitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer -lrb- right -rrb- and david ben gurion in new york in 1960 the two countries signed a reparations treaty in 1952 and subsequently developed various contacts , including a secret military relationship in which germany delivered weapons to israel .

only 15 years had passed since the liberation of auschwitz , and many thought it was too soon to establish formal relations with germany .

"
he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .
" the memorial must not be allowed to become a cemetery or a shrine .
and if this happens , we jews will have to consider whether we can enter this place . " paul spiegel has already voiced his criticism of the memorial project , which he says does n't go far enough .
" by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " he said at the opening ceremony on tuesday . on those grounds , he added that the information center underneath the memorial site which documents the fate of europe 's jews was an " indispensable addition .

we have an outstanding product in the bundesliga , and we need an outstanding return . " more money , please seifert was referring to a recent call by rummenigge for the soccer league to seek 200 million -lrb- $ 256 million -rrb- more euros through negotiations for the tv rights later this year .
that would put the total cost at 500 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge -lrb- right -rrb- wants 200 million euros more currently , seven of the bundesliga games kick off at 3:30 p.m.
saturdays and two on 5:30 p.m.
sundays .
all of them are broadcast in their entirety on pay channel premiere , with match highlights available to public channels ard , zdf and dsf .
the current contracts expire at the end of the 2005-2006 season . the current initative would give the pay channels greater exclusivity , drawing higher advertising rates since the matches would be broadcast farther ahead of the free channels . most other major european soccer leagues have already tried fiddling with start times with some success - which has motivated seifert . " we do n't want to ignore the interest of the public , " he said .
" we know that the situation in germany is more ' fan friendly ' compared to other european countries that are much more oriented towards pay tv interests ...

"
he added that he was surprised at the plan , which he said bordered on blasphemy . criticism rejected rosh responded to spiegel 's comments by saying that she had spoken to both the architect of the project , peter eisenman and to a rabi about her intentions , but the holocaust memorial foundation , which has not stated its position , says that rosh has not yet requested permission to press ahead with her plans . bildunterschrift : visitors can walk through the close-set pillars the chairman of berlin 's jewish community , albert meyer said the plans were not acceptable for jews .

" by focusing on the jews who were killed in wwii , the monument spares the viewer from confronting questions of guilt and responsibility , " he said at the opening ceremony on tuesday . on those grounds , he added that the information center underneath the memorial site which documents the fate of europe 's jews was an " indispensable addition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2005 easing workers ' mobility across the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but will their degrees be useful when they want to leave the country ?
traveling to other eu member states has never been easier for the union ’ s citizens , but those who want to earn a living away from home still face a bureaucratic nightmare - a situation the bloc wants to change . in theory , germans , just like all other european union members , are allowed to work in all member states of the bloc .
but in practice it 's not quite so easy .
individual states can still make it difficult , or even impossible , for foreigners to practice their chosen profession , a situation the bloc has been trying to change for decades .
the adoption of a report on wednesday by the european parliament could do away with a mishmash of 15 different eu directives and replace it with a single one that makes professional qualifications issued in one member state valid across all the union ’ s 25 nations in 2007 if the eu commission accepts it as expected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a european passport is no guarantee skills will be recognized recognition across the union making it easier to work abroad " we have such different systems of qualification in the member states , it 's not easy to find a way for mutual recognition , " said heide rühle , who is responsible for internal market issues for the european green party .
" under the proposed system it 's easier to move to another member state and to look for a new job . "
as unemployment in germany stays near the top of the european table at 9.8 percent , german job seekers are often well-advised to broaden their search to include nations like ireland and austria , where unemployment is 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent less .
the proposed guidelines would apply to over 150 professions , including french teachers - 80 percent of whom were denied the right to stand at the front of a german classroom between 2001 and 2002 - and german professors - 65 percent of whom failed in their attempts to have their professions recognized in the netherlands , according to eu internal market statistics .
professional mobility id cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers will be divided according to their skill level the new regulations would discern between five different types of credentials for all professions .
qualifications would be divided by jobs that require no training ; professions that require a technical education and secondary school diploma ; and the final levels would differentiate between three-year and four-year post-secondary training programs .
rühle also suggested a set of professional cards with information regarding workers ' career training and experience as well as any penalties imposed on them by professional organizations as a way of aiding worker mobility and bringing more transparency to the international job search .
" this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states , " she said .
keeping the public safe trade unions and economic groups are also interested in workers who can work throughout the eu and support the universal qualification acceptance .
but they would prefer to see certain restrictions put in place to protect not only local job markets but also public safety .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nurses and other health professionals will have to show a minimum set of skills before being able to work abroad " restrictions should cover mainly regulated professions where there is public safety at stake , " said petri lempinen , of the european trade union confederation .
" it is also important that incoming workers have same working conditions as local workers . "
other concerns come from german groups such as the association of german chambers of industry and commerce and confederation of german employers ' associations .
they fear that german qualifications will lose in stature if put on par with other european qualifications .
certain professions , especially in the health care industry , will also carry minimum education requirements and all professionals planning to work outside their native state for more than two years would have to register with established authorities as a way of protecting patients and customers .
a qualification 's native language german craftsmen , for example , need to undergo more training and a longer apprenticeship before they 're able to call themselves " bricklayers , " a title available to anyone in britain with two years of experience .
to be sure the public knows exactly what it 's getting for its money as workers move from one country to another , professionals have to use the title of their qualification in their native language , meaning a german bricklayer would go by maurer even when working outside germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bricklayer ?
that 's maurer to you !
" it is true that competition is going to increase , " said joachim wuermeling , a german christian social union member of european parliament .
" but german quality will become accepted and 150 german professions , from electrician to veterinarian to land surveyor . "
not included in the proposed guidelines are notaries , judges and other public servants , according to barbara weiler , a german member of the european parliament 's socialist group .
answer to local authorities even though their native qualifications are recognized , the new directive requires foreign workers to abide by the host country 's laws .
they will also be held legally responsible in their adopted country - earlier attempts to open the service sector by applying the laws of a person ’ s native country failed .

chief executive george krawiec said the authority had a long way to go , but the said the " building blocks for a brighter future " were in place .
but it added that progress had been slow and the council faced " significant challenges in modernising its culture " .
audit commission senior manager sue sunderland said : " the council has made progress over the last year by strengthening its own capacity and improving the way it works .
the building blocks for a brighter future have been put in place council chief executive george krawiec " the effects of its efforts are not yet being felt by the public and , although the early signs are encouraging , it recognises that there is still a lot to do .
" we are still looking to see improvements in key areas such as education and community safety . "
the inspectors found improvements in benefits processing , planning and improving results in waste management and social care .
steps had been taken to improve the quality of the public sector housing stock and to drive the council 's approach to regeneration but these were not yet making " a tangible difference to local people " .
' tough decisions ' financial management was better although the council had failed to produce an accurate set of accounts for the second year running .
mr krawiec said : " it is very encouraging that independent inspectors from the audit commission have recognised the authority is on the road to recovery .
" tough decisions have been made and a lot of hard work has been put in to help start to turn this authority round from one which was branded ' poor ' in 2002 , to one which aspires to be excellent . "
deputy council leader keith brookes said : " the public must not forget the deplorable position this council was in when the current administration took over .
" many will remember my words describing the situation like turning round a battleship .
it will take many years . "

" dump the dump " demonstrators will be carrying flowers to show they want to " keep hollingdean sweet and green " during thursday 's protest .
campaigners from defenders of the ouse valley and estuary -lrb- dove -rrb- are demonstrating over the newhaven plans .
brighton and hove city council will discuss the plan at its annual meeting .

the protesters say thursday 's demonstration will be lively but peaceful .
a planning application for the former abattoir site off hollingdean lane proposes three buildings .
one would be for sorting recyclable materials from kerbside collections and household waste recycling sites .
another would provide temporary storage for municipal waste before it is taken to a landfill or incinerator site .
there would also be a visitor centre and office building .
the city council says the idea is to manage waste within the area where it is produced and to minimise the volume sent to landfill .
the majority of household waste from brighton and hove currently goes to landfill sites at pebsham and beddingham , which will be full by 2008 .

now sogefi is returning the favour and i am pleased we are able to assist . "
economic development and transport minister andrew davies added the investment would help the company to fight " increasingly stiff competition , particularly from the far east " .

original proposals , due to start in the summer , aimed to pedestrianise market place and create a ' piazza ' .
the council says comments from initial consultation suggested locals felt they were not being listened to .

" only when we have the opinions of everyone likely to be affected by the scheme , will we be able to make an informed decision on the way forward . "

official figures show children involved in accidents are more likely to die in the country if they are pedestrians , cyclists or car passengers .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents blamed the speeds at which people drive in the country and the nature of the roads .
the charity has produced a schools pack to help reinforce safety measures .
rospa road safety project manager linda morrison allsopp said campaigns in the past had tended to target urban areas , but children in rural settings also needed advice .
" drivers forget that children live and play in rural areas .
rural v urban one in four child pedestrians in road accidents die or are seriously injured , compared to one in five urban pedestrians in 2003 .
while 17 % of 2003 child cyclist injuries were on rural roads , they accounted for nearly half of deaths .
of the 5,500 child car passengers hurt in 2003 , 51 died , whereas on urban roads 18 died out of 6,700 injuries .
" much higher speeds and bends and hills on many country roads reduce the distance that drivers can see ahead .
this gives them less time to react and results in more severe impacts . "
and she added : " although the higher speeds on rural roads increase the chance that a crash will be fatal , there is evidence that many country children are less likely to wear a seatbelt for every journey than those from towns . "
government statistics for 2003 showed that while about three times as many children were hurt in urban accidents as in rural ones , children in those accidents were more likely to die in the country .
injuries a quarter of child pedestrians in accidents were killed or seriously injured , compared to less than a fifth of those in urban settings .
and while 17 % of child cyclist injuries were on rural roads , they accounted for 44 % of the deaths .
of the 5,500 child car passengers hurt in 2003 , 51 died , whereas on urban roads 18 died out of 6,700 injuries .
the schools pack , which has been funded by the department for transport , has been sent to teachers across the country and includes advice on where on the roads children should walk , what sort of cycle training they should get and warnings about car travel .
it is designed so the advice can be incorporated in a range of lessons .
a spokeswoman for the department of transport said the government 's 200 road safety officers already tailored their advice depending on whether they were addressing children in urban or rural settings .
but she agreed more needed to be done to make sure the message reached rural areas .
" i think there is strong evidence to suggest that death rates are higher in the country and we need to pay attention to that .
" we are producing posters and redesigning our website so they are relevant to people in rural areas . "

people 's preferences have more to do with ikea than what they find in galleries , according to research .
doug hyde is the most popular living artist in the uk psychologist dr alison kidd found popular taste in art has broken free of the established " great artists " and people are increasingly comfortable in choosing what they like rather than what experts believe is good .
she says while the market for art has been growing , most people are not interested in famous names .
conversations with people looking for framed posters reveals that they seek out a particular colour and shape irrespective of who painted it .
a popular trend at the moment is for " minimalist , blotchy , brown , chocolate canvasses " .
others , she says , simply want something " for instance blue and stripey " , a change from the past .
" stripey things were not what you hung in my parents day , " dr kidd adds .
but she says britain 's new enthusiasm for abstract paintings has more to do with the tv programme changing rooms than tate modern .
department store john lewis now organises its art according to colour and mood rather than by artist .
in and out of fashion indeed , it appears , the popularity of famous artists makes them less appealing because people want their homes to look individual and do not want the same picture as their neighbours .
when talking to people , alison kidd found being " fresh " and " individual " was more important than fame or quality .
debra stroud 's abstract landscapes have been noticed by the art world and consumers nevertheless some artists have kept their popularity .
l s lowry ebbs in and out of fashion but still holds a place in the public 's imagination .
the slightly clothed mediterranean ladies of sir william russell flint are also big sellers .
mark rothko 's stark abstract images are beginning to slide down the popularity list after a high point around five years ago .
and two of the top ten , alan ingham and john miller , died recently .
both were landscape artists in very different styles .

matisse source : art business today indeed , although abstracts are increasingly appearing on people 's walls , we still prefer landscapes .
but those landscapes are themselves often fairly abstract .
bold colours at one of britain 's biggest retailers of reproduction art , ikea , sales of work printed on to canvas have been growing and one of the biggest sellers is a painting called fragmented harbour by david briggs .
around 3,500 are sold each week .
however , few people questioned knew the name of the painter .
the vogue for mark rothko appears to have been driven by the bold colours on people 's walls rather than an affection for the artist .
dr kidd says it could be argued ikea is more influential than tate modern on the british public .

nudes source : art business today in pictures : five years of tate modern but few of britain 's most popular artists make it in to a public gallery or museum .
jack vettriano has topped the list for several year .
his painting the singing butler recently sold for £ 744,800 .
he earns around £ 500,000 each year from posters and other licensed images , but feels the art world looks down on him .
he has yet to show his work in a major public gallery .
the most popular published british artist - winner of fine art trade guild 's award - is doug hyde .
almost unknown two years ago , he has now become a major draw at galleries around britain .
at one event some people had queued for more than six hours to meet him .
comic animals the late william russell flint is one today 's top selling artists his sentimental and comic images of animals , hearts and moon-faced smiley people has a keen following amongst adults and children .
they tend to provoke a smile which is not a reaction you see very often in museums .
the art is very different from anything considered for the turner prize .

people 's preferences have more to do with ikea than what they find in galleries , according to research .
doug hyde is the most popular living artist in the uk psychologist dr alison kidd found popular taste in art has broken free of the established " great artists " and people are increasingly comfortable in choosing what they like rather than what experts believe is good .
she says while the market for art has been growing , most people are not interested in famous names .
conversations with people looking for framed posters reveals that they seek out a particular colour and shape irrespective of who painted it .
a popular trend at the moment is for " minimalist , blotchy , brown , chocolate canvasses " .
others , she says , simply want something " for instance blue and stripey " , a change from the past .
" stripey things were not what you hung in my parents day , " dr kidd adds .
but she says britain 's new enthusiasm for abstract paintings has more to do with the tv programme changing rooms than tate modern .
department store john lewis now organises its art according to colour and mood rather than by artist .
in and out of fashion indeed , it appears , the popularity of famous artists makes them less appealing because people want their homes to look individual and do not want the same picture as their neighbours .
when talking to people , alison kidd found being " fresh " and " individual " was more important than fame or quality .
debra stroud 's abstract landscapes have been noticed by the art world and consumers nevertheless some artists have kept their popularity .
l s lowry ebbs in and out of fashion but still holds a place in the public 's imagination .
the slightly clothed mediterranean ladies of sir william russell flint are also big sellers .
mark rothko 's stark abstract images are beginning to slide down the popularity list after a high point around five years ago .
and two of the top ten , alan ingham and john miller , died recently .
both were landscape artists in very different styles .
top selling deceased artists 1 .
ls lowry 2 .
monet 3 .
alan ingham 4 .
russell flint 5 .
john miller 6 .
rothko 7 .
van gogh 8 .
picasso 9 .
klimt 10 .
matisse source : art business today indeed , although abstracts are increasingly appearing on people 's walls , we still prefer landscapes .
but those landscapes are themselves often fairly abstract .
bold colours at one of britain 's biggest retailers of reproduction art , ikea , sales of work printed on to canvas have been growing and one of the biggest sellers is a painting called fragmented harbour by david briggs .
around 3,500 are sold each week .
however , few people questioned knew the name of the painter .
the vogue for mark rothko appears to have been driven by the bold colours on people 's walls rather than an affection for the artist .
dr kidd says it could be argued ikea is more influential than tate modern on the british public .
best selling subjects in the uk 1 .
traditional landscapes 2 .
local views 3 .
modern or semi-abstract landscapes 4 .
abstracts 5 .
dogs 6 .
figure studies -lrb- excluding nudes -rrb- 7 .
seascapes , harbour and beach scenes 8 .
wildlife 9 .
impressionistic landscapes 10 .
nudes source : art business today in pictures : five years of tate modern but few of britain 's most popular artists make it in to a public gallery or museum .
jack vettriano has topped the list for several year .
his painting the singing butler recently sold for £ 744,800 .
he earns around £ 500,000 each year from posters and other licensed images , but feels the art world looks down on him .
he has yet to show his work in a major public gallery .
the most popular published british artist - winner of fine art trade guild 's award - is doug hyde .
almost unknown two years ago , he has now become a major draw at galleries around britain .
at one event some people had queued for more than six hours to meet him .
comic animals the late william russell flint is one today 's top selling artists his sentimental and comic images of animals , hearts and moon-faced smiley people has a keen following amongst adults and children .
they tend to provoke a smile which is not a reaction you see very often in museums .
the art is very different from anything considered for the turner prize .
but one of the leading art publishers in britain says " you get nowhere selling turner prize winners " .
britain may produce world-class " conceptual " art but we choose to hang something rather different on our walls .

the series has taken a string of awards and topped the ratings of australian channel abc every year for the past three years .
it has also spawned a flood of bizarre new catchphrases and celebrity cameos from singer kylie minogue , actor geoffrey rush and actress rachel griffiths .
" our sense of humour is similar to a lot of british humour , so i think british people will get it straight away , " says co-writer jane turner , who plays kath .
" we have a double whammy in that british people love to laugh at australians , " says gina riley , who plays kim .
" now they can laugh with us too . "
kim is a go-getter , but only in the sense that she will go and get some more food jane turner inspired by 1990s fly-on-the-wall series sylvania waters , the series sees self-absorbed kim move back in with her mother kath , who was busy enjoying new romance with the local butcher .
as the perky , poodle-permed kath tries to keep kim and her " second best friend " sharon away from her fridge , the show delves into the minutiae of middle-class melbourne suburbia .
" the characters are all pretty different .
kath is in good shape for a 40-something mum - she 's always cleaning and keeps herself ' trim and nice , " ' says turner .
" kim is also a go-getter , but only in the sense that she will go and get some more food , " adds riley .
as tension builds in the house , the characters mangle their language and stretch their vowels as far as possible , with kath 's regular demand : " look at moiye !

" but there are people in australia who have always spoken like that , " says riley .
" every day you can hear words being extended or people using malapropisms -lrb- wrongly using a word in place of a similar-sounding one -rrb- .
" i think we 've just helped people forget what the real words are .
after one episode a lot of people went into bars and asked for glasses of ' cardonnay . " '
turner and riley , who also produce the series , developed the characters after meeting at a youth arts centre at the age of 18 .
" gina did a little singing and i did a bit of dancing , so we started working together on sketches , " says turner .
kath and kim made their debut on weekly australian sketch shows big girl 's blouse and something stupid , before winning their own full series .
cult status the show has already attained cult status outside australia after being previewed in the us and on uk digital channels ftn and living tv .
" we seem to have attracted a lot of gay fans , which is fantastic because everyone knows the gay community has great taste and a good sense of humour , " says turner .

the series has taken a string of awards and topped the ratings of australian channel abc every year for the past three years .
it has also spawned a flood of bizarre new catchphrases and celebrity cameos from singer kylie minogue , actor geoffrey rush and actress rachel griffiths .
" our sense of humour is similar to a lot of british humour , so i think british people will get it straight away , " says co-writer jane turner , who plays kath .
" we have a double whammy in that british people love to laugh at australians , " says gina riley , who plays kim .
" now they can laugh with us too . "
kim is a go-getter , but only in the sense that she will go and get some more food jane turner inspired by 1990s fly-on-the-wall series sylvania waters , the series sees self-absorbed kim move back in with her mother kath , who was busy enjoying new romance with the local butcher .
as the perky , poodle-permed kath tries to keep kim and her " second best friend " sharon away from her fridge , the show delves into the minutiae of middle-class melbourne suburbia .
" the characters are all pretty different .
kath is in good shape for a 40-something mum - she 's always cleaning and keeps herself ' trim and nice , " ' says turner .
" kim is also a go-getter , but only in the sense that she will go and get some more food , " adds riley .
as tension builds in the house , the characters mangle their language and stretch their vowels as far as possible , with kath 's regular demand : " look at moiye !
look at moiye ! " often met by kim 's response : " i hayte it . "
set in melbourne , the series was inspired by tv show sylvania waters " if nothing else , we have made a lasting contribution to viewers ' vocabulary , " says turner , who must now contend with fans shouting " haor yur ? " and " hornbag " at her in the street -lrb- translated as " how are you ? " and " a highly desirable person " -rrb- .
" but there are people in australia who have always spoken like that , " says riley .
" every day you can hear words being extended or people using malapropisms -lrb- wrongly using a word in place of a similar-sounding one -rrb- .
" i think we 've just helped people forget what the real words are .
after one episode a lot of people went into bars and asked for glasses of ' cardonnay . " '
turner and riley , who also produce the series , developed the characters after meeting at a youth arts centre at the age of 18 .
" gina did a little singing and i did a bit of dancing , so we started working together on sketches , " says turner .
kath and kim made their debut on weekly australian sketch shows big girl 's blouse and something stupid , before winning their own full series .
cult status the show has already attained cult status outside australia after being previewed in the us and on uk digital channels ftn and living tv .
" we seem to have attracted a lot of gay fans , which is fantastic because everyone knows the gay community has great taste and a good sense of humour , " says turner .
" having kylie on the third series also went down well , " says riley .
" she was a fan of the show and was brilliant to work with , getting into character straight away . "
we just know the paparazzi are hiding behind bushes waiting to jump out on us at any minute gina riley having won numerous awards , including australia 's prestigious logie for most outstanding comedy programme , kath and kim 's creators remained tight-lipped on rumours of a movie version .
however , turner and riley say they are not daunted by the prospect of becoming the most famous australians in the uk since dame edna everage .
" we have already been recognised in selfridges , so we 're ready for it , " says riley .
" we ca n't see them , but we just know the paparazzi are hiding behind bushes waiting to jump out on us at any minute . "

" happy slapping " first began as a craze in south london , but has now become a nationwide phenomenon , according to police and anti-bullying organisations .
footage passed to the bbc showed an assault at a ramsgate skateboard park .
a school in tonbridge has also warned that a boy 's hearing has been damaged .
parents with children at the judd school have been urged to monitor the situation and were told the trend was " most unpleasant and hurtful " .
assaults are videoed on mobile phones and texted to other people videos of the slaps are sent to other mobile phones and posted on the internet .
nicola kerr , who works for the children 's charity kidscape , said the trend was difficult to control in schools because pupils were not leaving their video phones at home .
" some schools have tried getting the children to hand their phones into their form teachers at the beginning of each day , " she said .
police in kent say they have not received any complaints about " happy slapping " so far , but an incident at a leatherhead school in surrey last month prompted police to make an arrest and issue a warning .
in london , british transport police have investigated 200 incidents in the past six months .
reported incidents have included a youth approaching a woman at a bus stop and punching her in the face .
a conviction for assault could lead to up to five years in jail .

the drug cx717 belongs to a family of compounds called ampakines and works by boosting the brain chemical glutamate that makes learning and recall easy .
uk trials on 16 sleep-deprived volunteers showed it improved wakefulness and mental ability .
its creator , dr gary lynch from the university of california , told new scientist it could be used to treat jet lag and diseases like alzheimer 's .
as you get tired , communication between brain cells begins to fail .
when you take the pill , the communication is better inventor dr gary lynch hear the interview manufacturer cortex is considering cx717 as a possible treatment for narcolepsy - excessive daytime sleepiness ; and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -lrb- adhd -rrb- - a condition which impairs a child 's ability to concentrate .
it could also be taken by healthy people as a pick-me-up .
but it will have to undergo further clinical trials before going on sale .
dr lynch explained how the drug works .
" what it 's doing is causing the neurons to communicate with each other a little better .
" as you get tired , communication between brain cells begins to fail .
when you take the pill , the communication is better . "
he said the drug appeared to have no side effects and because it was not a physical stimulant , like amphetamines , users would still be able to sleep .
memory boost in the uk trial , led by julia boyle and colleagues from the university of surrey , healthy male volunteers aged 18 to 45 agreed to test the drug .
the volunteers started with a full night 's sleep and the following morning and evening were asked to complete a battery of tests assessing memory , attention , alertness , reaction time and problem solving .
at 11pm they took either the real or dummy pills and stayed up through the night , being retested at midnight , 1am , 3am , 5am and 9am .
the volunteers who took the ampakine performed much better than those who took the fake drug .
barbara sahakian , professor of clinical neuropsychiatry at cambridge university in the uk , said : " there has been a lot of promise with the ampakines and people are very excited about them . "
she said it could be useful for medical conditions that impaired memory and concentration , but warned against recreational use as has occurred with other stimulant drugs such as the adhd medication ritalin .
" i think it 's something we have to be concerned about because some of those people taking these drugs , their brains are still developing and we do not know the long-term consequences . "
