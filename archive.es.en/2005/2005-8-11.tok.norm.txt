program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.08.2005 -pipe- 13:00 utc ecb sees fragile recovery in euro zone the european central bank said on thursday that the euro-zone economy was heading for a period of " sustained and gradual " growth , despite the risks of high oil prices and weak consumer confidence .
the comments were supported by projections from the european union 's statistics agency eurostat , which said growth in the euro-zone economy had eased in the second quarter to 0.3 percent from the previous three months but was set to gather steam over the rest of the year .
" the governing council expects that the euro area economy will expand in a sustained , albeit gradual , manner , " the ecb said in its monthly statement .
the bank said robust global demand and an improvement in the competitiveness of european industry would help boost exports .
nevertheless , high oil prices and a lack of consumer confidence represent the " main downside risks " that could choke off a pick-up in activity .
earlier on thursday , the international energy agency said high oil prices had so far not reversed the expansion of the global economy .
statistics from germany showed that euro-zone 's biggest economy had stagnated in the second quarter , showing no growth compared to the previous three months . dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.08.2005 conservative gaffe enrages east germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open mouth , insert foot germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters . it was the second time in as many weeks that merkel , who has a strong but shrinking lead in the polls , was sideswiped by a fellow leading conservative in the depressed east ahead of the national election next month . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , who ran on the christian union ticket against chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 and narrowly lost , told a small group of supporters and journalists that the east had too much power over the poll 's outcome . " i do not accept that the east will again decide who will be germany 's chancellor .
it can not be allowed that the frustrated determine germany 's fate , " stoiber said , in comments made last week and first reported late wednesday . stoiber stepped up the attack at a campaign rally wednesday night , leaving christian union leaders scrambling to control the damage thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and his wife , karin " if only everywhere else were like bavaria , we would not have any problems at all .
but unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we do not have such intelligent members of the population everywhere like we have in bavaria , " he said . " the strong must sometimes carry the weak a bit .
that 's the way it is ...
i do not want the election to be decided in the east yet again . " hans michelbach of stoiber 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , insisted in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that stoiber had not meant to depict east germans as " second-class citizens . " ruffling already ruffled feathers but the latest broadsides come at a time when nerves are raw in the eastern states , where unemployment is twice as high as in the west nearly 15 years after national reunification . the interior minister of the eastern state of brandenburg , jörg schönbohm of the cdu , enraged voters in the region last week by blaming a lingering breakdown in social values under communism for fostering a horrific case in which a local mother was accused of killing nine of her newborn babies . bildunterschrift : angela merkel has had a few less-than-ideal interactions with journalists of late . merkel , who has made a few missteps of her own in recent speeches and interviews , was forced to reprimand the outspoken minister but not before his remarks drew a hail of criticism from offended easterners . new election dynamic the gaffes have suddenly revived an election campaign that looked all but decided , costing merkel 's cdu / csu alliance a point or two in some polls and robbing her of momentum ahead of the september 18 poll . they have also put a new spring in schröder 's step after the charismatic chancellor , in power since 1998 , had all but been written off . but above all , pollsters say the conservatives ' outbursts have helped a new breakaway alliance called the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism and members of the disaffected left-wing of schröder 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky , right , and top candidate gregor gysi on stage during the party congress of the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism , pds , in berlin the left party , which has ruled out a role in a governing coalition , is currently polling at more than 30 percent in the east ahead of the cdu / csu and looks set to scupper the conservatives ' goal of winning outright in the region . its rise has also reshuffled the electoral deck as analysts attempt to predict the next ruling coalition , increasing the likelihood that merkel will be unable to win a ruling majority with her preferred coalition partner , the free democrats . the new arithmetic may mean that merkel is forced into the highly rare political constellation of a " grand coalition " with the social democrats , forcing the arch rivals to form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby deaths become an election issue the alleged killing by an east german mother of nine of her newborn babies became an election issue friday as candidates lambasted an official who blamed attitudes in the former communist states for fostering the crime .

" i believe that the best way to break the impasse is to continue the discussions " between iran and the eu-3 -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- , the un chief said after a luncheon with japan 's un envoy kenzo oshima , the president of the un security council for august . annan spoke with reporters after iran broke un seals at a plant where bomb-grade uranium could be produced , defying western nations , which fear tehran wants to produce weapons rather than nuclear energy , as iran insists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general kofi annan " i have indications from both sides that they are prepared to continue the search for a solution , " the un head said .
" i hope that all sides will desist from any action that will lead to further escalation and continue the process at the -lrb- negotiating -rrb- table . " annan reiterated he had spoken by telephone recently with iran 's new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , urging him to show restraint and continue his dialogue with the european trio . security council threat the united states and three european powers directly involved in negotiations with iran have threatened to ask the board of governors of the un nuclear watchdog agency in vienna , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , to refer the matter to the un security council in new york for possible sanctions if tehran does not back down . but china 's un ambassador wang guangya said it would not be helpful to haul iran before the security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.08.2005 renewable sector wary of cdu promises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark days ahead for the renewables sector ?
should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .
-lrb- aug .
2 , 2005 -rrb- a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .

that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.08.2005 conservative gaffe enrages east germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open mouth , insert foot germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters . it was the second time in as many weeks that merkel , who has a strong but shrinking lead in the polls , was sideswiped by a fellow leading conservative in the depressed east ahead of the national election next month . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , who ran on the christian union ticket against chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 and narrowly lost , told a small group of supporters and journalists that the east had too much power over the poll 's outcome . " i do not accept that the east will again decide who will be germany 's chancellor .
it can not be allowed that the frustrated determine germany 's fate , " stoiber said , in comments made last week and first reported late wednesday . stoiber stepped up the attack at a campaign rally wednesday night , leaving christian union leaders scrambling to control the damage thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and his wife , karin " if only everywhere else were like bavaria , we would not have any problems at all .
but unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we do not have such intelligent members of the population everywhere like we have in bavaria , " he said . " the strong must sometimes carry the weak a bit .
that 's the way it is ...
i do not want the election to be decided in the east yet again . " hans michelbach of stoiber 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , insisted in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that stoiber had not meant to depict east germans as " second-class citizens . " ruffling already ruffled feathers but the latest broadsides come at a time when nerves are raw in the eastern states , where unemployment is twice as high as in the west nearly 15 years after national reunification . the interior minister of the eastern state of brandenburg , jörg schönbohm of the cdu , enraged voters in the region last week by blaming a lingering breakdown in social values under communism for fostering a horrific case in which a local mother was accused of killing nine of her newborn babies . bildunterschrift : angela merkel has had a few less-than-ideal interactions with journalists of late . merkel , who has made a few missteps of her own in recent speeches and interviews , was forced to reprimand the outspoken minister but not before his remarks drew a hail of criticism from offended easterners . new election dynamic the gaffes have suddenly revived an election campaign that looked all but decided , costing merkel 's cdu / csu alliance a point or two in some polls and robbing her of momentum ahead of the september 18 poll . they have also put a new spring in schröder 's step after the charismatic chancellor , in power since 1998 , had all but been written off . but above all , pollsters say the conservatives ' outbursts have helped a new breakaway alliance called the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism and members of the disaffected left-wing of schröder 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky , right , and top candidate gregor gysi on stage during the party congress of the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism , pds , in berlin the left party , which has ruled out a role in a governing coalition , is currently polling at more than 30 percent in the east ahead of the cdu / csu and looks set to scupper the conservatives ' goal of winning outright in the region . its rise has also reshuffled the electoral deck as analysts attempt to predict the next ruling coalition , increasing the likelihood that merkel will be unable to win a ruling majority with her preferred coalition partner , the free democrats . the new arithmetic may mean that merkel is forced into the highly rare political constellation of a " grand coalition " with the social democrats , forcing the arch rivals to form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby deaths become an election issue the alleged killing by an east german mother of nine of her newborn babies became an election issue friday as candidates lambasted an official who blamed attitudes in the former communist states for fostering the crime .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.08.2005 conservative gaffe enrages east germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open mouth , insert foot germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters . it was the second time in as many weeks that merkel , who has a strong but shrinking lead in the polls , was sideswiped by a fellow leading conservative in the depressed east ahead of the national election next month . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , who ran on the christian union ticket against chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 and narrowly lost , told a small group of supporters and journalists that the east had too much power over the poll 's outcome . " i do not accept that the east will again decide who will be germany 's chancellor .
it can not be allowed that the frustrated determine germany 's fate , " stoiber said , in comments made last week and first reported late wednesday . stoiber stepped up the attack at a campaign rally wednesday night , leaving christian union leaders scrambling to control the damage thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and his wife , karin " if only everywhere else were like bavaria , we would not have any problems at all .
but unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we do not have such intelligent members of the population everywhere like we have in bavaria , " he said . " the strong must sometimes carry the weak a bit .
that 's the way it is ...
i do not want the election to be decided in the east yet again . " hans michelbach of stoiber 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , insisted in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that stoiber had not meant to depict east germans as " second-class citizens . " ruffling already ruffled feathers but the latest broadsides come at a time when nerves are raw in the eastern states , where unemployment is twice as high as in the west nearly 15 years after national reunification . the interior minister of the eastern state of brandenburg , jörg schönbohm of the cdu , enraged voters in the region last week by blaming a lingering breakdown in social values under communism for fostering a horrific case in which a local mother was accused of killing nine of her newborn babies . bildunterschrift : angela merkel has had a few less-than-ideal interactions with journalists of late . merkel , who has made a few missteps of her own in recent speeches and interviews , was forced to reprimand the outspoken minister but not before his remarks drew a hail of criticism from offended easterners . new election dynamic the gaffes have suddenly revived an election campaign that looked all but decided , costing merkel 's cdu / csu alliance a point or two in some polls and robbing her of momentum ahead of the september 18 poll . they have also put a new spring in schröder 's step after the charismatic chancellor , in power since 1998 , had all but been written off . but above all , pollsters say the conservatives ' outbursts have helped a new breakaway alliance called the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism and members of the disaffected left-wing of schröder 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky , right , and top candidate gregor gysi on stage during the party congress of the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism , pds , in berlin the left party , which has ruled out a role in a governing coalition , is currently polling at more than 30 percent in the east ahead of the cdu / csu and looks set to scupper the conservatives ' goal of winning outright in the region . its rise has also reshuffled the electoral deck as analysts attempt to predict the next ruling coalition , increasing the likelihood that merkel will be unable to win a ruling majority with her preferred coalition partner , the free democrats . the new arithmetic may mean that merkel is forced into the highly rare political constellation of a " grand coalition " with the social democrats , forcing the arch rivals to form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby deaths become an election issue the alleged killing by an east german mother of nine of her newborn babies became an election issue friday as candidates lambasted an official who blamed attitudes in the former communist states for fostering the crime .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .
the goal of modernizing russia 's economy has pushed democratic principles to the sidelines . schröder has accepted this for reasons of realpolitik .
he did n't manage to solve the basic problem - his possible successor , angela merkel , is unlikely to fare any better . ingo mannteufel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .
the goal of modernizing russia 's economy has pushed democratic principles to the sidelines . schröder has accepted this for reasons of realpolitik .
he did n't manage to solve the basic problem - his possible successor , angela merkel , is unlikely to fare any better . ingo mannteufel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

the comments were supported by projections from the european union 's statistics agency eurostat , which said growth in the euro-zone economy had eased in the second quarter to 0.3 percent from the previous three months but was set to gather steam over the rest of the year .
" the governing council expects that the euro area economy will expand in a sustained , albeit gradual , manner , " the ecb said in its monthly statement .
the bank said robust global demand and an improvement in the competitiveness of european industry would help boost exports .
nevertheless , high oil prices and a lack of consumer confidence represent the " main downside risks " that could choke off a pick-up in activity .
earlier on thursday , the international energy agency said high oil prices had so far not reversed the expansion of the global economy .
statistics from germany showed that euro-zone 's biggest economy had stagnated in the second quarter , showing no growth compared to the previous three months . dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .
the goal of modernizing russia 's economy has pushed democratic principles to the sidelines . schröder has accepted this for reasons of realpolitik .
he did n't manage to solve the basic problem - his possible successor , angela merkel , is unlikely to fare any better . ingo mannteufel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

" i expect the ecb to take into account growth by lowering -lrb- interest -rrb- rates , in the context of monetary stability , " he told the daily passauer neue presse .
the ecb has held its rate unchanged at two percent since june 2003 in spite of calls for it to show greater flexibility .
clement drew a comparison with the swedish central bank and the bank of england which " have reacted in an appropriate way to the state of growth with rate cuts . "
in june the swedish central bank cuts its rate to a historic low of 1.5 percent , while the bank of england this month shaved its rate from 4.75 percent to 4.5 percent .
earlier this month the ecb left its rate unchanged .
its president , jean-claude trichet , defended the decision by the bank to maintain its key euro-zone interest rates , saying they were " appropriate " and noting signs of a pick-up in the euro-zone economy . dw-world.de berlin cuts growth forecast , slams ecb the german government scaled back its 2005 growth forecasts on friday , saying its earlier prognosis had been too optimistic .
berlin and rome also scolded the ecb , saying high interest rates are hindering growth .

" we still have a window of opportunity , " he said in vienna after the executive board of the un 's nuclear watchdog agency accepted the eu 's resolution .
" every opportunity should be made to defuse the crisis , through dialogue , " he added .
elbaradei said that by adopting the proposal , the iaea board had judged it essential that tehran reverse its resumption this week of uranium conversion activities at its isfahan plant as a " confidence-building measure " after years of dissimulation .
talks to secure guarantees that iran is not covertly developing a nuclear weapons capability under the guise of civil operations have been led by eu heavyweights britain , france and germany .
the iaea director said he was " very encouraged by the statements made by iran and the three europeans that they are ready to continue negotiations . "
the iaea reopened the meeting to debate the eu resolution calling on iran to halt the development of nuclear fuel in the face of a warning from tehran that an accord with the european union over its nuclear program would become void if the iaea adopted the resolution . acceptance would void accord , says tehran mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization , said in tehran that the resolution was " unacceptable " and that " the paris accord will become void if the resolution proposed by the europeans is adopted .

the big-budget production is now shooting in europe and scheduled for release in september 2006 . germany 's leading producer , bernd eichinger , who has brought other literary works such as umberto eco 's " the name of the rose " and isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits " to the silver screen has turned his attention to patrick süskind 's suspense novel , " perfume - the story of a murderer . "
now being filmed in germany , spain and france , the project has a hollywood-sized budget of $ 60 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- . the scene of the unusual and sensual tale is 18th century france .
a boy , jean-baptiste grenouille , is born with two unique characteristics .
he has no odor of his own but possesses an amazingly refined sense of smell .
as a youth , he delights in exploring the olfactory landscape of paris and eventually becomes an apprentice to a perfumer , giuseppe baldini , where he learns the art of mixing oils and herbs to produce scents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book but as his talents develop , he becomes obsessed with capturing the scents of everyday objects , like a door knob or freshly cut wood .
one day , he comes across the hint of a scent that will send him down a path of murder and sexual depravity . the book was published in 1985 and became an international bestseller .
it was translated into 42 languages and has enjoyed worldwide sales of more than 12 million .
now , it is heading for the silver screen . " i am attracted by a story if it is outstanding and can not be placed in a genre per se , " eichinger told reporters .
" this was absolutely the case with ' perfume , ' which i regard as one of the best novels of the last 50 years . " long delay it has not been easy to bring the novel to the cinema , since the film rights were initially not for sale .
the book 's publicity-shy author süskind , who lives in munich , had turned down offers from the likes of big hollywood players like martin scorsese , ridley scott and milos forman . it helped that eichinger and süskind knew one another personally and in 2001 , the producer was finally able to obtain the rights .
he and his production company , constantin film , wo n't reveal the cost of those rights , but estimates are that the amount could have been upwards of $ 10 million . eichinger is not afraid of spending lots of money or tackling challenging projects .
his movie " downfall , " which depicted the last days of adolph hitler 's life and aroused some controversy , was nominated for an academy award in the foreign film category . after working on a screenplay , eichinger decided to bring german director tom tykwer on board .
his credits include " run , lola , run " and the english-language film " heaven . " star power a particular coup for eichinger was luring hollywood star and academy award-winner dustin hoffman to the film .
the 67-year old will play master perfumer baldini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer -lrb- l-r -rrb- , bernd eichinger , alan rickman , rachel hurd-wood , ben whishaw und dustin hoffman in bavaria studios while filming " perfume " his apprentice , and murderer of women , grenouille , is portrayed by british actor ben whisaw , who starred in the film version of ian mcewan 's novel " enduring love " and recently received acclaim for his work in a london production of hamlet . according to eichinger , finding a good fit for the main character was important , since he does not fit into hollywood 's traditional role of good guy .
" the central figure is an anti-hero , a negative character , " eichinger said .
" he is not really a film figure in the sense of being a hero . " other cast members include england 's rachel hurd-wood and german actress karoline herfurth . shooting of the interiors began in munich this summer at bavaria film 's studio 12 , where baldini 's perfumery at the pont au chance was recreated .
it is an octagonal room filled with flacons , bottles and cylinders , with an ornate fountain in the center . now production has moved to spain and france where it is scheduled to wrap up in october .

" we still have a window of opportunity , " he said in vienna after the executive board of the un 's nuclear watchdog agency accepted the eu 's resolution .
" every opportunity should be made to defuse the crisis , through dialogue , " he added .
elbaradei said that by adopting the proposal , the iaea board had judged it essential that tehran reverse its resumption this week of uranium conversion activities at its isfahan plant as a " confidence-building measure " after years of dissimulation .
talks to secure guarantees that iran is not covertly developing a nuclear weapons capability under the guise of civil operations have been led by eu heavyweights britain , france and germany .
the iaea director said he was " very encouraged by the statements made by iran and the three europeans that they are ready to continue negotiations . "
the iaea reopened the meeting to debate the eu resolution calling on iran to halt the development of nuclear fuel in the face of a warning from tehran that an accord with the european union over its nuclear program would become void if the iaea adopted the resolution . acceptance would void accord , says tehran mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization , said in tehran that the resolution was " unacceptable " and that " the paris accord will become void if the resolution proposed by the europeans is adopted .

the iaea 's 35-nation board was meeting in emergency session in vienna a day after tehran raised the stakes in the crisis over its nuclear program by removing iaea seals placed on a uranium conversion facility . the plant at isfahan carries out the first step in making enriched uranium that can be fuel for power reactors , but can also serve as the raw material for nuclear bombs . encouraged by iran , non-aligned nations at the iaea opposed the draft resolution and forced a delay in opening thursday 's formal board session as intense , closed-door negotiations continued , diplomats said . eu wants full suspension of activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security person talks on his radio , at the uranium conversion facility of iran , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , 255 miles south of the capital tehran , monday , aug .

iran resumed uranium conversion activities at the facility monday .
according to the draft , iran is urged " to reestablish full suspension of all enrichment-related activities including the production of feed material , including through tests of production at the uranium conversion facility " in isfahan . the iaea is being asked for a consensus adoption of the text from eu negotiators britain , germany and france , which stops short of calling for the matter to be taken immediately to the un security council for possible sanctions , as washington wants .

the big-budget production is now shooting in europe and scheduled for release in september 2006 . germany 's leading producer , bernd eichinger , who has brought other literary works such as umberto eco 's " the name of the rose " and isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits " to the silver screen has turned his attention to patrick süskind 's suspense novel , " perfume - the story of a murderer . "
now being filmed in germany , spain and france , the project has a hollywood-sized budget of $ 60 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- . the scene of the unusual and sensual tale is 18th century france .
a boy , jean-baptiste grenouille , is born with two unique characteristics .
he has no odor of his own but possesses an amazingly refined sense of smell .
as a youth , he delights in exploring the olfactory landscape of paris and eventually becomes an apprentice to a perfumer , giuseppe baldini , where he learns the art of mixing oils and herbs to produce scents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book but as his talents develop , he becomes obsessed with capturing the scents of everyday objects , like a door knob or freshly cut wood .
one day , he comes across the hint of a scent that will send him down a path of murder and sexual depravity . the book was published in 1985 and became an international bestseller .
it was translated into 42 languages and has enjoyed worldwide sales of more than 12 million .
now , it is heading for the silver screen . " i am attracted by a story if it is outstanding and can not be placed in a genre per se , " eichinger told reporters .
" this was absolutely the case with ' perfume , ' which i regard as one of the best novels of the last 50 years . " long delay it has not been easy to bring the novel to the cinema , since the film rights were initially not for sale .
the book 's publicity-shy author süskind , who lives in munich , had turned down offers from the likes of big hollywood players like martin scorsese , ridley scott and milos forman . it helped that eichinger and süskind knew one another personally and in 2001 , the producer was finally able to obtain the rights .
he and his production company , constantin film , wo n't reveal the cost of those rights , but estimates are that the amount could have been upwards of $ 10 million . eichinger is not afraid of spending lots of money or tackling challenging projects .
his movie " downfall , " which depicted the last days of adolph hitler 's life and aroused some controversy , was nominated for an academy award in the foreign film category . after working on a screenplay , eichinger decided to bring german director tom tykwer on board .
his credits include " run , lola , run " and the english-language film " heaven . " star power a particular coup for eichinger was luring hollywood star and academy award-winner dustin hoffman to the film .
the 67-year old will play master perfumer baldini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer -lrb- l-r -rrb- , bernd eichinger , alan rickman , rachel hurd-wood , ben whishaw und dustin hoffman in bavaria studios while filming " perfume " his apprentice , and murderer of women , grenouille , is portrayed by british actor ben whisaw , who starred in the film version of ian mcewan 's novel " enduring love " and recently received acclaim for his work in a london production of hamlet . according to eichinger , finding a good fit for the main character was important , since he does not fit into hollywood 's traditional role of good guy .
" the central figure is an anti-hero , a negative character , " eichinger said .
" he is not really a film figure in the sense of being a hero . " other cast members include england 's rachel hurd-wood and german actress karoline herfurth . shooting of the interiors began in munich this summer at bavaria film 's studio 12 , where baldini 's perfumery at the pont au chance was recreated .
it is an octagonal room filled with flacons , bottles and cylinders , with an ornate fountain in the center . now production has moved to spain and france where it is scheduled to wrap up in october .

the comments were supported by projections from the european union 's statistics agency eurostat , which said growth in the euro-zone economy had eased in the second quarter to 0.3 percent from the previous three months but was set to gather steam over the rest of the year .
" the governing council expects that the euro area economy will expand in a sustained , albeit gradual , manner , " the ecb said in its monthly statement .
the bank said robust global demand and an improvement in the competitiveness of european industry would help boost exports .
nevertheless , high oil prices and a lack of consumer confidence represent the " main downside risks " that could choke off a pick-up in activity .
earlier on thursday , the international energy agency said high oil prices had so far not reversed the expansion of the global economy .

the big-budget production is now shooting in europe and scheduled for release in september 2006 . germany 's leading producer , bernd eichinger , who has brought other literary works such as umberto eco 's " the name of the rose " and isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits " to the silver screen has turned his attention to patrick süskind 's suspense novel , " perfume - the story of a murderer . "
now being filmed in germany , spain and france , the project has a hollywood-sized budget of $ 60 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- . the scene of the unusual and sensual tale is 18th century france .
a boy , jean-baptiste grenouille , is born with two unique characteristics .
he has no odor of his own but possesses an amazingly refined sense of smell .
as a youth , he delights in exploring the olfactory landscape of paris and eventually becomes an apprentice to a perfumer , giuseppe baldini , where he learns the art of mixing oils and herbs to produce scents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book but as his talents develop , he becomes obsessed with capturing the scents of everyday objects , like a door knob or freshly cut wood .
one day , he comes across the hint of a scent that will send him down a path of murder and sexual depravity . the book was published in 1985 and became an international bestseller .
it was translated into 42 languages and has enjoyed worldwide sales of more than 12 million .
now , it is heading for the silver screen . " i am attracted by a story if it is outstanding and can not be placed in a genre per se , " eichinger told reporters .
" this was absolutely the case with ' perfume , ' which i regard as one of the best novels of the last 50 years . " long delay it has not been easy to bring the novel to the cinema , since the film rights were initially not for sale .
the book 's publicity-shy author süskind , who lives in munich , had turned down offers from the likes of big hollywood players like martin scorsese , ridley scott and milos forman . it helped that eichinger and süskind knew one another personally and in 2001 , the producer was finally able to obtain the rights .
he and his production company , constantin film , wo n't reveal the cost of those rights , but estimates are that the amount could have been upwards of $ 10 million . eichinger is not afraid of spending lots of money or tackling challenging projects .
his movie " downfall , " which depicted the last days of adolph hitler 's life and aroused some controversy , was nominated for an academy award in the foreign film category . after working on a screenplay , eichinger decided to bring german director tom tykwer on board .
his credits include " run , lola , run " and the english-language film " heaven . " star power a particular coup for eichinger was luring hollywood star and academy award-winner dustin hoffman to the film .
the 67-year old will play master perfumer baldini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer -lrb- l-r -rrb- , bernd eichinger , alan rickman , rachel hurd-wood , ben whishaw und dustin hoffman in bavaria studios while filming " perfume " his apprentice , and murderer of women , grenouille , is portrayed by british actor ben whisaw , who starred in the film version of ian mcewan 's novel " enduring love " and recently received acclaim for his work in a london production of hamlet . according to eichinger , finding a good fit for the main character was important , since he does not fit into hollywood 's traditional role of good guy .
" the central figure is an anti-hero , a negative character , " eichinger said .
" he is not really a film figure in the sense of being a hero . " other cast members include england 's rachel hurd-wood and german actress karoline herfurth . shooting of the interiors began in munich this summer at bavaria film 's studio 12 , where baldini 's perfumery at the pont au chance was recreated .
it is an octagonal room filled with flacons , bottles and cylinders , with an ornate fountain in the center . now production has moved to spain and france where it is scheduled to wrap up in october .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.08.2005 conservative gaffe enrages east germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open mouth , insert foot germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters . it was the second time in as many weeks that merkel , who has a strong but shrinking lead in the polls , was sideswiped by a fellow leading conservative in the depressed east ahead of the national election next month . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , who ran on the christian union ticket against chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 and narrowly lost , told a small group of supporters and journalists that the east had too much power over the poll 's outcome . " i do not accept that the east will again decide who will be germany 's chancellor .
it can not be allowed that the frustrated determine germany 's fate , " stoiber said , in comments made last week and first reported late wednesday . stoiber stepped up the attack at a campaign rally wednesday night , leaving christian union leaders scrambling to control the damage thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and his wife , karin " if only everywhere else were like bavaria , we would not have any problems at all .
but unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we do not have such intelligent members of the population everywhere like we have in bavaria , " he said . " the strong must sometimes carry the weak a bit .
that 's the way it is ...
i do not want the election to be decided in the east yet again . " hans michelbach of stoiber 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , insisted in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that stoiber had not meant to depict east germans as " second-class citizens . " ruffling already ruffled feathers but the latest broadsides come at a time when nerves are raw in the eastern states , where unemployment is twice as high as in the west nearly 15 years after national reunification . the interior minister of the eastern state of brandenburg , jörg schönbohm of the cdu , enraged voters in the region last week by blaming a lingering breakdown in social values under communism for fostering a horrific case in which a local mother was accused of killing nine of her newborn babies . bildunterschrift : angela merkel has had a few less-than-ideal interactions with journalists of late . merkel , who has made a few missteps of her own in recent speeches and interviews , was forced to reprimand the outspoken minister but not before his remarks drew a hail of criticism from offended easterners . new election dynamic the gaffes have suddenly revived an election campaign that looked all but decided , costing merkel 's cdu / csu alliance a point or two in some polls and robbing her of momentum ahead of the september 18 poll . they have also put a new spring in schröder 's step after the charismatic chancellor , in power since 1998 , had all but been written off . but above all , pollsters say the conservatives ' outbursts have helped a new breakaway alliance called the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism and members of the disaffected left-wing of schröder 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky , right , and top candidate gregor gysi on stage during the party congress of the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism , pds , in berlin the left party , which has ruled out a role in a governing coalition , is currently polling at more than 30 percent in the east ahead of the cdu / csu and looks set to scupper the conservatives ' goal of winning outright in the region . its rise has also reshuffled the electoral deck as analysts attempt to predict the next ruling coalition , increasing the likelihood that merkel will be unable to win a ruling majority with her preferred coalition partner , the free democrats . the new arithmetic may mean that merkel is forced into the highly rare political constellation of a " grand coalition " with the social democrats , forcing the arch rivals to form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby deaths become an election issue the alleged killing by an east german mother of nine of her newborn babies became an election issue friday as candidates lambasted an official who blamed attitudes in the former communist states for fostering the crime .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .

industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .

the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .

the big-budget production is now shooting in europe and scheduled for release in september 2006 . germany 's leading producer , bernd eichinger , who has brought other literary works such as umberto eco 's " the name of the rose " and isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits " to the silver screen has turned his attention to patrick süskind 's suspense novel , " perfume - the story of a murderer . "
now being filmed in germany , spain and france , the project has a hollywood-sized budget of $ 60 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- . the scene of the unusual and sensual tale is 18th century france .
a boy , jean-baptiste grenouille , is born with two unique characteristics .
he has no odor of his own but possesses an amazingly refined sense of smell .
as a youth , he delights in exploring the olfactory landscape of paris and eventually becomes an apprentice to a perfumer , giuseppe baldini , where he learns the art of mixing oils and herbs to produce scents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book but as his talents develop , he becomes obsessed with capturing the scents of everyday objects , like a door knob or freshly cut wood .
one day , he comes across the hint of a scent that will send him down a path of murder and sexual depravity . the book was published in 1985 and became an international bestseller .
it was translated into 42 languages and has enjoyed worldwide sales of more than 12 million .
now , it is heading for the silver screen . " i am attracted by a story if it is outstanding and can not be placed in a genre per se , " eichinger told reporters .
" this was absolutely the case with ' perfume , ' which i regard as one of the best novels of the last 50 years . " long delay it has not been easy to bring the novel to the cinema , since the film rights were initially not for sale .
the book 's publicity-shy author süskind , who lives in munich , had turned down offers from the likes of big hollywood players like martin scorsese , ridley scott and milos forman . it helped that eichinger and süskind knew one another personally and in 2001 , the producer was finally able to obtain the rights .
he and his production company , constantin film , wo n't reveal the cost of those rights , but estimates are that the amount could have been upwards of $ 10 million . eichinger is not afraid of spending lots of money or tackling challenging projects .
his movie " downfall , " which depicted the last days of adolph hitler 's life and aroused some controversy , was nominated for an academy award in the foreign film category . after working on a screenplay , eichinger decided to bring german director tom tykwer on board .
his credits include " run , lola , run " and the english-language film " heaven . " star power a particular coup for eichinger was luring hollywood star and academy award-winner dustin hoffman to the film .
the 67-year old will play master perfumer baldini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer -lrb- l-r -rrb- , bernd eichinger , alan rickman , rachel hurd-wood , ben whishaw und dustin hoffman in bavaria studios while filming " perfume " his apprentice , and murderer of women , grenouille , is portrayed by british actor ben whisaw , who starred in the film version of ian mcewan 's novel " enduring love " and recently received acclaim for his work in a london production of hamlet . according to eichinger , finding a good fit for the main character was important , since he does not fit into hollywood 's traditional role of good guy .
" the central figure is an anti-hero , a negative character , " eichinger said .
" he is not really a film figure in the sense of being a hero . " other cast members include england 's rachel hurd-wood and german actress karoline herfurth . shooting of the interiors began in munich this summer at bavaria film 's studio 12 , where baldini 's perfumery at the pont au chance was recreated .
it is an octagonal room filled with flacons , bottles and cylinders , with an ornate fountain in the center . now production has moved to spain and france where it is scheduled to wrap up in october .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.08.2005 conservative gaffe enrages east germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open mouth , insert foot germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters . it was the second time in as many weeks that merkel , who has a strong but shrinking lead in the polls , was sideswiped by a fellow leading conservative in the depressed east ahead of the national election next month . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , who ran on the christian union ticket against chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 and narrowly lost , told a small group of supporters and journalists that the east had too much power over the poll 's outcome . " i do not accept that the east will again decide who will be germany 's chancellor .
it can not be allowed that the frustrated determine germany 's fate , " stoiber said , in comments made last week and first reported late wednesday . stoiber stepped up the attack at a campaign rally wednesday night , leaving christian union leaders scrambling to control the damage thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and his wife , karin " if only everywhere else were like bavaria , we would not have any problems at all .
but unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we do not have such intelligent members of the population everywhere like we have in bavaria , " he said . " the strong must sometimes carry the weak a bit .
that 's the way it is ...
i do not want the election to be decided in the east yet again . " hans michelbach of stoiber 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , insisted in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that stoiber had not meant to depict east germans as " second-class citizens . " ruffling already ruffled feathers but the latest broadsides come at a time when nerves are raw in the eastern states , where unemployment is twice as high as in the west nearly 15 years after national reunification . the interior minister of the eastern state of brandenburg , jörg schönbohm of the cdu , enraged voters in the region last week by blaming a lingering breakdown in social values under communism for fostering a horrific case in which a local mother was accused of killing nine of her newborn babies . bildunterschrift : angela merkel has had a few less-than-ideal interactions with journalists of late . merkel , who has made a few missteps of her own in recent speeches and interviews , was forced to reprimand the outspoken minister but not before his remarks drew a hail of criticism from offended easterners . new election dynamic the gaffes have suddenly revived an election campaign that looked all but decided , costing merkel 's cdu / csu alliance a point or two in some polls and robbing her of momentum ahead of the september 18 poll . they have also put a new spring in schröder 's step after the charismatic chancellor , in power since 1998 , had all but been written off . but above all , pollsters say the conservatives ' outbursts have helped a new breakaway alliance called the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism and members of the disaffected left-wing of schröder 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky , right , and top candidate gregor gysi on stage during the party congress of the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism , pds , in berlin the left party , which has ruled out a role in a governing coalition , is currently polling at more than 30 percent in the east ahead of the cdu / csu and looks set to scupper the conservatives ' goal of winning outright in the region . its rise has also reshuffled the electoral deck as analysts attempt to predict the next ruling coalition , increasing the likelihood that merkel will be unable to win a ruling majority with her preferred coalition partner , the free democrats . the new arithmetic may mean that merkel is forced into the highly rare political constellation of a " grand coalition " with the social democrats , forcing the arch rivals to form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby deaths become an election issue the alleged killing by an east german mother of nine of her newborn babies became an election issue friday as candidates lambasted an official who blamed attitudes in the former communist states for fostering the crime .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .

during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .

germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .

" we still have a window of opportunity , " he said in vienna after the executive board of the un 's nuclear watchdog agency accepted the eu 's resolution .
" every opportunity should be made to defuse the crisis , through dialogue , " he added .
elbaradei said that by adopting the proposal , the iaea board had judged it essential that tehran reverse its resumption this week of uranium conversion activities at its isfahan plant as a " confidence-building measure " after years of dissimulation .
talks to secure guarantees that iran is not covertly developing a nuclear weapons capability under the guise of civil operations have been led by eu heavyweights britain , france and germany .
the iaea director said he was " very encouraged by the statements made by iran and the three europeans that they are ready to continue negotiations . "
the iaea reopened the meeting to debate the eu resolution calling on iran to halt the development of nuclear fuel in the face of a warning from tehran that an accord with the european union over its nuclear program would become void if the iaea adopted the resolution . acceptance would void accord , says tehran mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization , said in tehran that the resolution was " unacceptable " and that " the paris accord will become void if the resolution proposed by the europeans is adopted .

the iaea 's 35-nation board was meeting in emergency session in vienna a day after tehran raised the stakes in the crisis over its nuclear program by removing iaea seals placed on a uranium conversion facility . the plant at isfahan carries out the first step in making enriched uranium that can be fuel for power reactors , but can also serve as the raw material for nuclear bombs . encouraged by iran , non-aligned nations at the iaea opposed the draft resolution and forced a delay in opening thursday 's formal board session as intense , closed-door negotiations continued , diplomats said . eu wants full suspension of activities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security person talks on his radio , at the uranium conversion facility of iran , just outside the city of isfahan , 410 kilometers , 255 miles south of the capital tehran , monday , aug .

iran resumed uranium conversion activities at the facility monday .
according to the draft , iran is urged " to reestablish full suspension of all enrichment-related activities including the production of feed material , including through tests of production at the uranium conversion facility " in isfahan . the iaea is being asked for a consensus adoption of the text from eu negotiators britain , germany and france , which stops short of calling for the matter to be taken immediately to the un security council for possible sanctions , as washington wants .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .

opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .

2 , 2005 -rrb- a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
the prospect of victory by germany 's conservative opposition in an early general election has shaken up the country 's energy sector .
the nuclear power industry is hoping to slow the planned phase out atomic energy .

the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .

the prospect of victory by germany 's conservative opposition in an early general election has shaken up the country 's energy sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.08.2005 renewable sector wary of cdu promises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark days ahead for the renewables sector ?
should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .
the goal of modernizing russia 's economy has pushed democratic principles to the sidelines . schröder has accepted this for reasons of realpolitik .
he did n't manage to solve the basic problem - his possible successor , angela merkel , is unlikely to fare any better . ingo mannteufel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .

schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .
the goal of modernizing russia 's economy has pushed democratic principles to the sidelines . schröder has accepted this for reasons of realpolitik .
he did n't manage to solve the basic problem - his possible successor , angela merkel , is unlikely to fare any better . ingo mannteufel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.08.2005 conservative gaffe enrages east germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open mouth , insert foot germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters . it was the second time in as many weeks that merkel , who has a strong but shrinking lead in the polls , was sideswiped by a fellow leading conservative in the depressed east ahead of the national election next month . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , who ran on the christian union ticket against chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 and narrowly lost , told a small group of supporters and journalists that the east had too much power over the poll 's outcome . " i do not accept that the east will again decide who will be germany 's chancellor .
it can not be allowed that the frustrated determine germany 's fate , " stoiber said , in comments made last week and first reported late wednesday . stoiber stepped up the attack at a campaign rally wednesday night , leaving christian union leaders scrambling to control the damage thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and his wife , karin " if only everywhere else were like bavaria , we would not have any problems at all .
but unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we do not have such intelligent members of the population everywhere like we have in bavaria , " he said . " the strong must sometimes carry the weak a bit .
that 's the way it is ...
i do not want the election to be decided in the east yet again . " hans michelbach of stoiber 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , insisted in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that stoiber had not meant to depict east germans as " second-class citizens . " ruffling already ruffled feathers but the latest broadsides come at a time when nerves are raw in the eastern states , where unemployment is twice as high as in the west nearly 15 years after national reunification . the interior minister of the eastern state of brandenburg , jörg schönbohm of the cdu , enraged voters in the region last week by blaming a lingering breakdown in social values under communism for fostering a horrific case in which a local mother was accused of killing nine of her newborn babies . bildunterschrift : angela merkel has had a few less-than-ideal interactions with journalists of late . merkel , who has made a few missteps of her own in recent speeches and interviews , was forced to reprimand the outspoken minister but not before his remarks drew a hail of criticism from offended easterners . new election dynamic the gaffes have suddenly revived an election campaign that looked all but decided , costing merkel 's cdu / csu alliance a point or two in some polls and robbing her of momentum ahead of the september 18 poll . they have also put a new spring in schröder 's step after the charismatic chancellor , in power since 1998 , had all but been written off . but above all , pollsters say the conservatives ' outbursts have helped a new breakaway alliance called the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism and members of the disaffected left-wing of schröder 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky , right , and top candidate gregor gysi on stage during the party congress of the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism , pds , in berlin the left party , which has ruled out a role in a governing coalition , is currently polling at more than 30 percent in the east ahead of the cdu / csu and looks set to scupper the conservatives ' goal of winning outright in the region . its rise has also reshuffled the electoral deck as analysts attempt to predict the next ruling coalition , increasing the likelihood that merkel will be unable to win a ruling majority with her preferred coalition partner , the free democrats . the new arithmetic may mean that merkel is forced into the highly rare political constellation of a " grand coalition " with the social democrats , forcing the arch rivals to form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby deaths become an election issue the alleged killing by an east german mother of nine of her newborn babies became an election issue friday as candidates lambasted an official who blamed attitudes in the former communist states for fostering the crime .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .

the big-budget production is now shooting in europe and scheduled for release in september 2006 . germany 's leading producer , bernd eichinger , who has brought other literary works such as umberto eco 's " the name of the rose " and isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits " to the silver screen has turned his attention to patrick süskind 's suspense novel , " perfume - the story of a murderer . "
now being filmed in germany , spain and france , the project has a hollywood-sized budget of $ 60 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- . the scene of the unusual and sensual tale is 18th century france .
a boy , jean-baptiste grenouille , is born with two unique characteristics .
he has no odor of his own but possesses an amazingly refined sense of smell .
as a youth , he delights in exploring the olfactory landscape of paris and eventually becomes an apprentice to a perfumer , giuseppe baldini , where he learns the art of mixing oils and herbs to produce scents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book but as his talents develop , he becomes obsessed with capturing the scents of everyday objects , like a door knob or freshly cut wood .
one day , he comes across the hint of a scent that will send him down a path of murder and sexual depravity . the book was published in 1985 and became an international bestseller .
it was translated into 42 languages and has enjoyed worldwide sales of more than 12 million .
now , it is heading for the silver screen . " i am attracted by a story if it is outstanding and can not be placed in a genre per se , " eichinger told reporters .
" this was absolutely the case with ' perfume , ' which i regard as one of the best novels of the last 50 years . " long delay it has not been easy to bring the novel to the cinema , since the film rights were initially not for sale .
the book 's publicity-shy author süskind , who lives in munich , had turned down offers from the likes of big hollywood players like martin scorsese , ridley scott and milos forman . it helped that eichinger and süskind knew one another personally and in 2001 , the producer was finally able to obtain the rights .
he and his production company , constantin film , wo n't reveal the cost of those rights , but estimates are that the amount could have been upwards of $ 10 million . eichinger is not afraid of spending lots of money or tackling challenging projects .
his movie " downfall , " which depicted the last days of adolph hitler 's life and aroused some controversy , was nominated for an academy award in the foreign film category . after working on a screenplay , eichinger decided to bring german director tom tykwer on board .
his credits include " run , lola , run " and the english-language film " heaven . " star power a particular coup for eichinger was luring hollywood star and academy award-winner dustin hoffman to the film .
the 67-year old will play master perfumer baldini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer -lrb- l-r -rrb- , bernd eichinger , alan rickman , rachel hurd-wood , ben whishaw und dustin hoffman in bavaria studios while filming " perfume " his apprentice , and murderer of women , grenouille , is portrayed by british actor ben whisaw , who starred in the film version of ian mcewan 's novel " enduring love " and recently received acclaim for his work in a london production of hamlet . according to eichinger , finding a good fit for the main character was important , since he does not fit into hollywood 's traditional role of good guy .
" the central figure is an anti-hero , a negative character , " eichinger said .
" he is not really a film figure in the sense of being a hero . " other cast members include england 's rachel hurd-wood and german actress karoline herfurth . shooting of the interiors began in munich this summer at bavaria film 's studio 12 , where baldini 's perfumery at the pont au chance was recreated .
it is an octagonal room filled with flacons , bottles and cylinders , with an ornate fountain in the center . now production has moved to spain and france where it is scheduled to wrap up in october .

the big-budget production is now shooting in europe and scheduled for release in september 2006 . germany 's leading producer , bernd eichinger , who has brought other literary works such as umberto eco 's " the name of the rose " and isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits " to the silver screen has turned his attention to patrick süskind 's suspense novel , " perfume - the story of a murderer . "
now being filmed in germany , spain and france , the project has a hollywood-sized budget of $ 60 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- . the scene of the unusual and sensual tale is 18th century france .
a boy , jean-baptiste grenouille , is born with two unique characteristics .
he has no odor of his own but possesses an amazingly refined sense of smell .
as a youth , he delights in exploring the olfactory landscape of paris and eventually becomes an apprentice to a perfumer , giuseppe baldini , where he learns the art of mixing oils and herbs to produce scents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book but as his talents develop , he becomes obsessed with capturing the scents of everyday objects , like a door knob or freshly cut wood .
one day , he comes across the hint of a scent that will send him down a path of murder and sexual depravity . the book was published in 1985 and became an international bestseller .
it was translated into 42 languages and has enjoyed worldwide sales of more than 12 million .
now , it is heading for the silver screen . " i am attracted by a story if it is outstanding and can not be placed in a genre per se , " eichinger told reporters .
" this was absolutely the case with ' perfume , ' which i regard as one of the best novels of the last 50 years . " long delay it has not been easy to bring the novel to the cinema , since the film rights were initially not for sale .
the book 's publicity-shy author süskind , who lives in munich , had turned down offers from the likes of big hollywood players like martin scorsese , ridley scott and milos forman . it helped that eichinger and süskind knew one another personally and in 2001 , the producer was finally able to obtain the rights .
he and his production company , constantin film , wo n't reveal the cost of those rights , but estimates are that the amount could have been upwards of $ 10 million . eichinger is not afraid of spending lots of money or tackling challenging projects .
his movie " downfall , " which depicted the last days of adolph hitler 's life and aroused some controversy , was nominated for an academy award in the foreign film category . after working on a screenplay , eichinger decided to bring german director tom tykwer on board .
his credits include " run , lola , run " and the english-language film " heaven . " star power a particular coup for eichinger was luring hollywood star and academy award-winner dustin hoffman to the film .
the 67-year old will play master perfumer baldini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer -lrb- l-r -rrb- , bernd eichinger , alan rickman , rachel hurd-wood , ben whishaw und dustin hoffman in bavaria studios while filming " perfume " his apprentice , and murderer of women , grenouille , is portrayed by british actor ben whisaw , who starred in the film version of ian mcewan 's novel " enduring love " and recently received acclaim for his work in a london production of hamlet . according to eichinger , finding a good fit for the main character was important , since he does not fit into hollywood 's traditional role of good guy .
" the central figure is an anti-hero , a negative character , " eichinger said .
" he is not really a film figure in the sense of being a hero . " other cast members include england 's rachel hurd-wood and german actress karoline herfurth . shooting of the interiors began in munich this summer at bavaria film 's studio 12 , where baldini 's perfumery at the pont au chance was recreated .
it is an octagonal room filled with flacons , bottles and cylinders , with an ornate fountain in the center . now production has moved to spain and france where it is scheduled to wrap up in october .

the big-budget production is now shooting in europe and scheduled for release in september 2006 . germany 's leading producer , bernd eichinger , who has brought other literary works such as umberto eco 's " the name of the rose " and isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits " to the silver screen has turned his attention to patrick süskind 's suspense novel , " perfume - the story of a murderer . "
now being filmed in germany , spain and france , the project has a hollywood-sized budget of $ 60 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- . the scene of the unusual and sensual tale is 18th century france .
a boy , jean-baptiste grenouille , is born with two unique characteristics .
he has no odor of his own but possesses an amazingly refined sense of smell .
as a youth , he delights in exploring the olfactory landscape of paris and eventually becomes an apprentice to a perfumer , giuseppe baldini , where he learns the art of mixing oils and herbs to produce scents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book but as his talents develop , he becomes obsessed with capturing the scents of everyday objects , like a door knob or freshly cut wood .
one day , he comes across the hint of a scent that will send him down a path of murder and sexual depravity . the book was published in 1985 and became an international bestseller .
it was translated into 42 languages and has enjoyed worldwide sales of more than 12 million .
now , it is heading for the silver screen . " i am attracted by a story if it is outstanding and can not be placed in a genre per se , " eichinger told reporters .
" this was absolutely the case with ' perfume , ' which i regard as one of the best novels of the last 50 years . " long delay it has not been easy to bring the novel to the cinema , since the film rights were initially not for sale .
the book 's publicity-shy author süskind , who lives in munich , had turned down offers from the likes of big hollywood players like martin scorsese , ridley scott and milos forman . it helped that eichinger and süskind knew one another personally and in 2001 , the producer was finally able to obtain the rights .
he and his production company , constantin film , wo n't reveal the cost of those rights , but estimates are that the amount could have been upwards of $ 10 million . eichinger is not afraid of spending lots of money or tackling challenging projects .
his movie " downfall , " which depicted the last days of adolph hitler 's life and aroused some controversy , was nominated for an academy award in the foreign film category . after working on a screenplay , eichinger decided to bring german director tom tykwer on board .
his credits include " run , lola , run " and the english-language film " heaven . " star power a particular coup for eichinger was luring hollywood star and academy award-winner dustin hoffman to the film .
the 67-year old will play master perfumer baldini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer -lrb- l-r -rrb- , bernd eichinger , alan rickman , rachel hurd-wood , ben whishaw und dustin hoffman in bavaria studios while filming " perfume " his apprentice , and murderer of women , grenouille , is portrayed by british actor ben whisaw , who starred in the film version of ian mcewan 's novel " enduring love " and recently received acclaim for his work in a london production of hamlet . according to eichinger , finding a good fit for the main character was important , since he does not fit into hollywood 's traditional role of good guy .
" the central figure is an anti-hero , a negative character , " eichinger said .
" he is not really a film figure in the sense of being a hero . " other cast members include england 's rachel hurd-wood and german actress karoline herfurth . shooting of the interiors began in munich this summer at bavaria film 's studio 12 , where baldini 's perfumery at the pont au chance was recreated .
it is an octagonal room filled with flacons , bottles and cylinders , with an ornate fountain in the center . now production has moved to spain and france where it is scheduled to wrap up in october .
the theatrical release is set for september 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film portrays hitler in human light adolf hitler spent his last days in an underground bunker in berlin amid a combination of fear and unreality .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .

the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.08.2005 renewable sector wary of cdu promises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark days ahead for the renewables sector ?
should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .

industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .
the goal of modernizing russia 's economy has pushed democratic principles to the sidelines . schröder has accepted this for reasons of realpolitik .
he did n't manage to solve the basic problem - his possible successor , angela merkel , is unlikely to fare any better . ingo mannteufel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .

" hans michelbach of stoiber 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , insisted in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that stoiber had not meant to depict east germans as " second-class citizens . " ruffling already ruffled feathers but the latest broadsides come at a time when nerves are raw in the eastern states , where unemployment is twice as high as in the west nearly 15 years after national reunification . the interior minister of the eastern state of brandenburg , jörg schönbohm of the cdu , enraged voters in the region last week by blaming a lingering breakdown in social values under communism for fostering a horrific case in which a local mother was accused of killing nine of her newborn babies . bildunterschrift : angela merkel has had a few less-than-ideal interactions with journalists of late . merkel , who has made a few missteps of her own in recent speeches and interviews , was forced to reprimand the outspoken minister but not before his remarks drew a hail of criticism from offended easterners . new election dynamic the gaffes have suddenly revived an election campaign that looked all but decided , costing merkel 's cdu / csu alliance a point or two in some polls and robbing her of momentum ahead of the september 18 poll . they have also put a new spring in schröder 's step after the charismatic chancellor , in power since 1998 , had all but been written off . but above all , pollsters say the conservatives ' outbursts have helped a new breakaway alliance called the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism and members of the disaffected left-wing of schröder 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky , right , and top candidate gregor gysi on stage during the party congress of the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism , pds , in berlin the left party , which has ruled out a role in a governing coalition , is currently polling at more than 30 percent in the east ahead of the cdu / csu and looks set to scupper the conservatives ' goal of winning outright in the region . its rise has also reshuffled the electoral deck as analysts attempt to predict the next ruling coalition , increasing the likelihood that merkel will be unable to win a ruling majority with her preferred coalition partner , the free democrats . the new arithmetic may mean that merkel is forced into the highly rare political constellation of a " grand coalition " with the social democrats , forcing the arch rivals to form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby deaths become an election issue the alleged killing by an east german mother of nine of her newborn babies became an election issue friday as candidates lambasted an official who blamed attitudes in the former communist states for fostering the crime .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .

the big-budget production is now shooting in europe and scheduled for release in september 2006 . germany 's leading producer , bernd eichinger , who has brought other literary works such as umberto eco 's " the name of the rose " and isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits " to the silver screen has turned his attention to patrick süskind 's suspense novel , " perfume - the story of a murderer . "
now being filmed in germany , spain and france , the project has a hollywood-sized budget of $ 60 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- . the scene of the unusual and sensual tale is 18th century france .
a boy , jean-baptiste grenouille , is born with two unique characteristics .
he has no odor of his own but possesses an amazingly refined sense of smell .
as a youth , he delights in exploring the olfactory landscape of paris and eventually becomes an apprentice to a perfumer , giuseppe baldini , where he learns the art of mixing oils and herbs to produce scents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book but as his talents develop , he becomes obsessed with capturing the scents of everyday objects , like a door knob or freshly cut wood .
one day , he comes across the hint of a scent that will send him down a path of murder and sexual depravity . the book was published in 1985 and became an international bestseller .
it was translated into 42 languages and has enjoyed worldwide sales of more than 12 million .
now , it is heading for the silver screen . " i am attracted by a story if it is outstanding and can not be placed in a genre per se , " eichinger told reporters .
" this was absolutely the case with ' perfume , ' which i regard as one of the best novels of the last 50 years . " long delay it has not been easy to bring the novel to the cinema , since the film rights were initially not for sale .
the book 's publicity-shy author süskind , who lives in munich , had turned down offers from the likes of big hollywood players like martin scorsese , ridley scott and milos forman . it helped that eichinger and süskind knew one another personally and in 2001 , the producer was finally able to obtain the rights .
he and his production company , constantin film , wo n't reveal the cost of those rights , but estimates are that the amount could have been upwards of $ 10 million . eichinger is not afraid of spending lots of money or tackling challenging projects .
his movie " downfall , " which depicted the last days of adolph hitler 's life and aroused some controversy , was nominated for an academy award in the foreign film category . after working on a screenplay , eichinger decided to bring german director tom tykwer on board .
his credits include " run , lola , run " and the english-language film " heaven . " star power a particular coup for eichinger was luring hollywood star and academy award-winner dustin hoffman to the film .
the 67-year old will play master perfumer baldini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer -lrb- l-r -rrb- , bernd eichinger , alan rickman , rachel hurd-wood , ben whishaw und dustin hoffman in bavaria studios while filming " perfume " his apprentice , and murderer of women , grenouille , is portrayed by british actor ben whisaw , who starred in the film version of ian mcewan 's novel " enduring love " and recently received acclaim for his work in a london production of hamlet . according to eichinger , finding a good fit for the main character was important , since he does not fit into hollywood 's traditional role of good guy .
" the central figure is an anti-hero , a negative character , " eichinger said .
" he is not really a film figure in the sense of being a hero . " other cast members include england 's rachel hurd-wood and german actress karoline herfurth . shooting of the interiors began in munich this summer at bavaria film 's studio 12 , where baldini 's perfumery at the pont au chance was recreated .
it is an octagonal room filled with flacons , bottles and cylinders , with an ornate fountain in the center . now production has moved to spain and france where it is scheduled to wrap up in october .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.08.2005 conservative gaffe enrages east germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open mouth , insert foot germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters . it was the second time in as many weeks that merkel , who has a strong but shrinking lead in the polls , was sideswiped by a fellow leading conservative in the depressed east ahead of the national election next month . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , who ran on the christian union ticket against chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 and narrowly lost , told a small group of supporters and journalists that the east had too much power over the poll 's outcome . " i do not accept that the east will again decide who will be germany 's chancellor .
it can not be allowed that the frustrated determine germany 's fate , " stoiber said , in comments made last week and first reported late wednesday . stoiber stepped up the attack at a campaign rally wednesday night , leaving christian union leaders scrambling to control the damage thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and his wife , karin " if only everywhere else were like bavaria , we would not have any problems at all .
but unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we do not have such intelligent members of the population everywhere like we have in bavaria , " he said . " the strong must sometimes carry the weak a bit .
that 's the way it is ...
i do not want the election to be decided in the east yet again . " hans michelbach of stoiber 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , insisted in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that stoiber had not meant to depict east germans as " second-class citizens . " ruffling already ruffled feathers but the latest broadsides come at a time when nerves are raw in the eastern states , where unemployment is twice as high as in the west nearly 15 years after national reunification . the interior minister of the eastern state of brandenburg , jörg schönbohm of the cdu , enraged voters in the region last week by blaming a lingering breakdown in social values under communism for fostering a horrific case in which a local mother was accused of killing nine of her newborn babies . bildunterschrift : angela merkel has had a few less-than-ideal interactions with journalists of late . merkel , who has made a few missteps of her own in recent speeches and interviews , was forced to reprimand the outspoken minister but not before his remarks drew a hail of criticism from offended easterners . new election dynamic the gaffes have suddenly revived an election campaign that looked all but decided , costing merkel 's cdu / csu alliance a point or two in some polls and robbing her of momentum ahead of the september 18 poll . they have also put a new spring in schröder 's step after the charismatic chancellor , in power since 1998 , had all but been written off . but above all , pollsters say the conservatives ' outbursts have helped a new breakaway alliance called the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism and members of the disaffected left-wing of schröder 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky , right , and top candidate gregor gysi on stage during the party congress of the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism , pds , in berlin the left party , which has ruled out a role in a governing coalition , is currently polling at more than 30 percent in the east ahead of the cdu / csu and looks set to scupper the conservatives ' goal of winning outright in the region . its rise has also reshuffled the electoral deck as analysts attempt to predict the next ruling coalition , increasing the likelihood that merkel will be unable to win a ruling majority with her preferred coalition partner , the free democrats . the new arithmetic may mean that merkel is forced into the highly rare political constellation of a " grand coalition " with the social democrats , forcing the arch rivals to form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby deaths become an election issue the alleged killing by an east german mother of nine of her newborn babies became an election issue friday as candidates lambasted an official who blamed attitudes in the former communist states for fostering the crime .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .

during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .

germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .

" every opportunity should be made to defuse the crisis , through dialogue , " he added .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 11.08.2005 conservative gaffe enrages east germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open mouth , insert foot germany 's first chancellor candidate from the east , angela merkel , ran into fresh electoral problems in the crucial ex-communist states thursday after a key ally bashed the region 's " frustrated " voters . it was the second time in as many weeks that merkel , who has a strong but shrinking lead in the polls , was sideswiped by a fellow leading conservative in the depressed east ahead of the national election next month . bavarian state premier edmund stoiber , who ran on the christian union ticket against chancellor gerhard schröder in 2002 and narrowly lost , told a small group of supporters and journalists that the east had too much power over the poll 's outcome . " i do not accept that the east will again decide who will be germany 's chancellor .
it can not be allowed that the frustrated determine germany 's fate , " stoiber said , in comments made last week and first reported late wednesday . stoiber stepped up the attack at a campaign rally wednesday night , leaving christian union leaders scrambling to control the damage thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber and his wife , karin " if only everywhere else were like bavaria , we would not have any problems at all .
but unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we do not have such intelligent members of the population everywhere like we have in bavaria , " he said . " the strong must sometimes carry the weak a bit .
that 's the way it is ...
i do not want the election to be decided in the east yet again . " hans michelbach of stoiber 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , insisted in an interview with public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that stoiber had not meant to depict east germans as " second-class citizens . " ruffling already ruffled feathers but the latest broadsides come at a time when nerves are raw in the eastern states , where unemployment is twice as high as in the west nearly 15 years after national reunification . the interior minister of the eastern state of brandenburg , jörg schönbohm of the cdu , enraged voters in the region last week by blaming a lingering breakdown in social values under communism for fostering a horrific case in which a local mother was accused of killing nine of her newborn babies . bildunterschrift : angela merkel has had a few less-than-ideal interactions with journalists of late . merkel , who has made a few missteps of her own in recent speeches and interviews , was forced to reprimand the outspoken minister but not before his remarks drew a hail of criticism from offended easterners . new election dynamic the gaffes have suddenly revived an election campaign that looked all but decided , costing merkel 's cdu / csu alliance a point or two in some polls and robbing her of momentum ahead of the september 18 poll . they have also put a new spring in schröder 's step after the charismatic chancellor , in power since 1998 , had all but been written off . but above all , pollsters say the conservatives ' outbursts have helped a new breakaway alliance called the left party , comprising the ex-communist party of democratic socialism and members of the disaffected left-wing of schröder 's social democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds chairman lothar bisky , right , and top candidate gregor gysi on stage during the party congress of the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism , pds , in berlin the left party , which has ruled out a role in a governing coalition , is currently polling at more than 30 percent in the east ahead of the cdu / csu and looks set to scupper the conservatives ' goal of winning outright in the region . its rise has also reshuffled the electoral deck as analysts attempt to predict the next ruling coalition , increasing the likelihood that merkel will be unable to win a ruling majority with her preferred coalition partner , the free democrats . the new arithmetic may mean that merkel is forced into the highly rare political constellation of a " grand coalition " with the social democrats , forcing the arch rivals to form a government . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baby deaths become an election issue the alleged killing by an east german mother of nine of her newborn babies became an election issue friday as candidates lambasted an official who blamed attitudes in the former communist states for fostering the crime .

should the conservatives win september 's election , the renewable energy sector , which boomed under the green party 's influence , will be hit by changes .
opinions are clashing over what 's best for germany 's economy . when the conservative union comprised of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , presented their election platform , the details of their intentions as to germany 's energy policy were sketchy at best . in a much-anticipated speech at a recent conference sponsored by the german electricity association -lrb- vdew -rrb- , cdu leader angela merkel left many delegates from the renewable energy sector scratching their heads .
she announced that a conservative-led government would continue to focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel on renewables , but introduce " a number of corrections to the course " taken by the social democratic-green governing coalition .
in particular , she said , the conservatives would re-think the " economically irresponsible " subsidies to the renewables sector . " it 's still unclear to me what to expect from ms. merkel , " said ralf bischof , director of the german wind energy association , after merkel 's speech .
" she said the cdu would still support renewables , but not how . " merkel 's speech received sufficient applause though , due to the large number of representatives from the conventional energy sector in the audience , who were likely relieved to hear that the cdu and csu envision an energy supply from a wide array of sources , including oil , coal , gas and nuclear energy .
renewables should make up 12.5 percent of the energy supply , but receive fewer subsidies . additionally , the conservatives have said they would put the brakes on the nuclear phase-out introduced by the greens , allowing the country 's atomic reactors to continue operating past the 2020 deadline .
merkel 's reasoning was purely economic .
if germany is no longer active in nuclear power , she said , then it would have no influence on the international market when it comes to exporting nuclear technology . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " in my view , an ideologically motivated nuclear phase-out does not reflect economic demands , " merkel said , citing the fact that countries such as india and china are expanding their nuclear energy capacities .
" for me , the question is , how can germany with its technical know-how profit from this export potential .
as a patriot , i would like to see my country profit from our expertise , not watch others take the profits . " renewables a growth sector the greens , on the other hand , stress the impressive growth the renewables sector has enjoyed over the past seven years of spd-green rule , and warn of the consequences for this booming branch should a new conservative government undo past achievements . last year , the renewables sector employed 130,000 people , effectively doubling the number of employees it had in 1998 .
industry representatives say the goal is for 500,000 people to be working in such fields as wind , solar and hydro-power .
the industry is responsible for a turnover of 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 14 billion -rrb- a year , two thirds of which flow into investments that lead to job creation .
the renewable energy sources act -lrb- eeg -rrb- , passed by the government in 2000 , has enabled germany to become a market leader in renewable technology and know-how , said environment minister jürgen trittin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin presents a poster announcing the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in obrigheim .
" the first concrete announcement the cdu made for the new election is that the energy turnaround we 've achieved should be turned back again , " trittin said at the vdew conference . "
i was bewildered to hear the cdu 's energy policy spokesman say they did n't intend to ' destroy everything . '
i 'm sure voters are interested in hearing just which jobs and which companies will be destroyed by the cdu . " indeed , share prices in solar and wind-energy companies fell by two percent on the news that chancellor gerhard schröder wanted to call early elections , which pollsters say are almost certain to be won by the cdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shell ag solar panel factory in gelsenkirchen is one of the world 's biggest .
but since the beginning of june , shares in the renewables sector have been steadily regaining lost ground and more .
shares in solar energy firms have increased by around 50 percent on average , reported the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
companies that build wind energy power stations , after watching their shares take a beating last year , are also reporting improved performance as of late . investors remain optimistic investors in the renewable energy sector do n't seem to be unsettled by the potential change of government .
that could have something to do with the fact that the cdu has signaled it wo n't introduce a new subsidy model for the renewables sector until the end of 2007 at the earliest .
but there is perhaps enough confidence that the sector will continue to grow regardless of which government is sitting in berlin , as international pressure to cut harmful emissions and reliance on some forms of energy - oil , for example - increases . " the cdu has always said it intended to continue the expansion of renewables , so the goal is not at issue , " johannes lackmann , president of the german renewable energy foundation -lrb- bee -rrb- said .
" we expect a clear statement from angela merkel so that there wo n't be uncertainty .
we want to discuss the most efficient way to move forward with renewables , but the way itself must not be put in question . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy oil and gas are scarce resources .
politicians have vastly different ideas when it comes to meeting growing energy demand .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .
the goal of modernizing russia 's economy has pushed democratic principles to the sidelines . schröder has accepted this for reasons of realpolitik .
he did n't manage to solve the basic problem - his possible successor , angela merkel , is unlikely to fare any better . ingo mannteufel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .
germany 's role as the driving force behind europe 's policy on russia also came in handy , as did germany 's willingness to move ahead of the rest of the eu on certain issues , such as visa regulations . putin 's approval for the kyoto climate control protocol was a success for schröder , as was his role during the ukrainian crisis of 2004 .
putin 's trust in schröder made it easier for him to accept change in kiev . a crucial problem but a central problem in german-russian relations remained despite shared interests and buddy politics : too little agreement on basic political values existed for a real partnership , as shown by developments in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and german chancellor gerhard schröder speak at putin 's vacation residence in the black sea resort of sochi , russia on aug .
30 , 2004 since the end of the soviet union , neither democracy nor the concept of a constitutional state have taken hold in russia .
the country 's political elite and large parts of the population are disillusioned because of their experiences during the 1990s .
the goal of modernizing russia 's economy has pushed democratic principles to the sidelines . schröder has accepted this for reasons of realpolitik .
he did n't manage to solve the basic problem - his possible successor , angela merkel , is unlikely to fare any better . ingo mannteufel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

close german-russian ties have been a constant for both schröder and putin in their respective foreign policies .
despite having benefited from it , their relationship suffers from a fundamental flaw . media-friendly " buddy politics " between german chancellors and soviet and russian leaders have shaped german-russian relations for the past 15 years .
former chancellor helmut kohl and mikhail gorbachev got along just fine , and kohl and former russian president boris yeltsin did even better . bildunterschrift : goprbachev gives kohl flowers picked by the soviet leader 's wife raissa during a meeting in july 1990 but schröder and putin went a step further : " gerd " and " volodya " obviously also get along on a personal level , as proven by christmas and birthday parties the two men have spent together . they also focused on tightening relations between germany and russia on a political level .
during the past five years , there has n't been another other country that russia has been closer to than germany in terms of meetings and exchanges between high-ranking government officials .
that includes regular summits between schröder and putin , government meetings and the " petersburg dialogue , " which was initiated by the two men and is meant to bring the two countries ' elites closer together . puti n 's germa n co n n ectio n even if putin 's foreign policy has gone back and forth , the partnership with germany has remained stable .
his affinity to germany - he speaks the language and lived in east germany - certainly plays a role .
schröder 's russia policy also helped to shape putin 's view on germany , however . bildunterschrift : schröder and putin during a meeting in russia on july 3 , 2005 the german chancellor has avoided criticizing putin 's domestic policy record in public and only voiced concern behind closed doors .
this " quiet diplomacy " helped improve ties and found its climax in schröder 's public announcement that putin was a " flawless democrat . " statements like these made schröder putin 's most important political partner in europe .
in return , schröder 's stand against us policy on iraq only gained weight because of backing by france and russia .
the partnership between germany and russia became especially important during schröder 's second term in office after the 2002 election . there were other advantages as well : both countries benefited from a flourishing trade and economic exchange .
german finance minister hans eichel was able to fix some of his budget problems by receiving debt payments from russia ahead of time . mutually be n eficial agreeme n t bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife doris with putin and his wife lyudmila during the celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow on may 9 , 2005 berlin 's support also helped moscow 's ambitions to join what 's now the g8 and the world trade organization .

the big-budget production is now shooting in europe and scheduled for release in september 2006 . germany 's leading producer , bernd eichinger , who has brought other literary works such as umberto eco 's " the name of the rose " and isabel allende 's " the house of the spirits " to the silver screen has turned his attention to patrick süskind 's suspense novel , " perfume - the story of a murderer . "
now being filmed in germany , spain and france , the project has a hollywood-sized budget of $ 60 million -lrb- 49 million euros -rrb- . the scene of the unusual and sensual tale is 18th century france .
a boy , jean-baptiste grenouille , is born with two unique characteristics .
he has no odor of his own but possesses an amazingly refined sense of smell .
as a youth , he delights in exploring the olfactory landscape of paris and eventually becomes an apprentice to a perfumer , giuseppe baldini , where he learns the art of mixing oils and herbs to produce scents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book but as his talents develop , he becomes obsessed with capturing the scents of everyday objects , like a door knob or freshly cut wood .
one day , he comes across the hint of a scent that will send him down a path of murder and sexual depravity . the book was published in 1985 and became an international bestseller .
it was translated into 42 languages and has enjoyed worldwide sales of more than 12 million .
now , it is heading for the silver screen . " i am attracted by a story if it is outstanding and can not be placed in a genre per se , " eichinger told reporters .
" this was absolutely the case with ' perfume , ' which i regard as one of the best novels of the last 50 years . " long delay it has not been easy to bring the novel to the cinema , since the film rights were initially not for sale .
the book 's publicity-shy author süskind , who lives in munich , had turned down offers from the likes of big hollywood players like martin scorsese , ridley scott and milos forman . it helped that eichinger and süskind knew one another personally and in 2001 , the producer was finally able to obtain the rights .
he and his production company , constantin film , wo n't reveal the cost of those rights , but estimates are that the amount could have been upwards of $ 10 million . eichinger is not afraid of spending lots of money or tackling challenging projects .
his movie " downfall , " which depicted the last days of adolph hitler 's life and aroused some controversy , was nominated for an academy award in the foreign film category . after working on a screenplay , eichinger decided to bring german director tom tykwer on board .
his credits include " run , lola , run " and the english-language film " heaven . " star power a particular coup for eichinger was luring hollywood star and academy award-winner dustin hoffman to the film .
the 67-year old will play master perfumer baldini . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom tykwer -lrb- l-r -rrb- , bernd eichinger , alan rickman , rachel hurd-wood , ben whishaw und dustin hoffman in bavaria studios while filming " perfume " his apprentice , and murderer of women , grenouille , is portrayed by british actor ben whisaw , who starred in the film version of ian mcewan 's novel " enduring love " and recently received acclaim for his work in a london production of hamlet . according to eichinger , finding a good fit for the main character was important , since he does not fit into hollywood 's traditional role of good guy .
" the central figure is an anti-hero , a negative character , " eichinger said .
" he is not really a film figure in the sense of being a hero . " other cast members include england 's rachel hurd-wood and german actress karoline herfurth . shooting of the interiors began in munich this summer at bavaria film 's studio 12 , where baldini 's perfumery at the pont au chance was recreated .
it is an octagonal room filled with flacons , bottles and cylinders , with an ornate fountain in the center . now production has moved to spain and france where it is scheduled to wrap up in october .

controversy has surrounded preparations for next week 's event in cologne , where pope benedict xvi is to deliver a mass to young people , after the german government refused to issue visas to certain pilgrims from the philippines , cameroon and togo .
fifty pilgrims from the philippines , the world 's third most populous catholic nation , were among those barred from the event to be attended by some 400,000 young people from 193 countries .
but the episcopal commission on youth -lrb- ecy -rrb- of the catholic bishops conference of the philippines -lrb- cbcp -rrb- said the german mission here subsequently reconsidered and granted visas to 43 of them .
" we are happy about the small percentage of denied visas .
it establishes or confirms the legitimacy of the group , the ecy philippines , " a senior official of the cbcp commission told reporters .
the remaining seven delegates were found to be " belonging to the young professional category and no longer falling under the youth class , " said the official , who asked not to be named .
the official said the visa issue is " not new " because out of the filipino delegates to such catholic youth festivals , a certain proportion are always denied visas .
the philippines sent a 322-member delegation to cologne on wednesday . dw-world.de dw-world : catholic pilgrims face german visa hurdles illegal immigration fears have hindered some visa requests by young catholics planning to attend the world youth day in cologne .
the organizers are working with the german foreign ministry to resolve the issues .

new figures show the current account surplus - a broad measure of exports and imports of goods and services - falling by 15.3 % in june .
japan has traditionally been an export led economy , particularly in recent years as deflation and recession at home hit domestic demand .
but now the recovering economy is reducing reliance on sales overseas .
off balance ?
the figures , released by the ministry of finance , showed exports up 3.7 % in value from june 2004 - but imports rose by 13.1 % .
the current account surplus dropped to 1.09 trillion yen -lrb- $ 9.9bn ; £ 5.5bn -rrb- , while the narrower trade surplus fell below 1 trillion yen .
worries have been voiced recently that export-led growth could be in trouble .
sales to china , now japan 's second most significant trading partner after the us , have flattened as the government in beijing tries to cool its white-hot economy .
late last year , the japanese government had warned of a " soft patch " as exports to asia slowed .
but the rise in imports , economists said , was almost entirely due to the cost of energy , while exports were healthier than they looked .
japan has no indigenous hydrocarbons , and is therefore entirely reliant on oil imports - the cost of which is up more than 50 % since the start of this year .
" the biggest factor behind the smaller current account surplus is higher oil prices squeezing the trade surplus , " said norinchukin research institute economist takeshi minami .
imports of crude oil are up a third for the first half of 2005 .
meanwhile , the domestic economy is showing signs of solid recovery for the first time in more than a decade .
domestic demand - for years one of japan 's biggest weak spots - is on the up , with economists optimistic about growth figures for the second quarter due on friday .

new figures show the current account surplus - a broad measure of exports and imports of goods and services - falling by 15.3 % in june .
japan has traditionally been an export led economy , particularly in recent years as deflation and recession at home hit domestic demand .
but now the recovering economy is reducing reliance on sales overseas .
off balance ?
the figures , released by the ministry of finance , showed exports up 3.7 % in value from june 2004 - but imports rose by 13.1 % .
the current account surplus dropped to 1.09 trillion yen -lrb- $ 9.9bn ; £ 5.5bn -rrb- , while the narrower trade surplus fell below 1 trillion yen .
worries have been voiced recently that export-led growth could be in trouble .
sales to china , now japan 's second most significant trading partner after the us , have flattened as the government in beijing tries to cool its white-hot economy .
late last year , the japanese government had warned of a " soft patch " as exports to asia slowed .
but the rise in imports , economists said , was almost entirely due to the cost of energy , while exports were healthier than they looked .
japan has no indigenous hydrocarbons , and is therefore entirely reliant on oil imports - the cost of which is up more than 50 % since the start of this year .
" the biggest factor behind the smaller current account surplus is higher oil prices squeezing the trade surplus , " said norinchukin research institute economist takeshi minami .
imports of crude oil are up a third for the first half of 2005 .
meanwhile , the domestic economy is showing signs of solid recovery for the first time in more than a decade .
domestic demand - for years one of japan 's biggest weak spots - is on the up , with economists optimistic about growth figures for the second quarter due on friday .

an employment tribunal has ruled allied steel and wired -lrb- asw -rrb- staff unfairly lost 90 days ' pay when they were made redundant without any notice .
their union , community , said workers from the cardiff plant would benefit from the pay-out .
asw 's administrators kpmg said the cash would come from the sale of assets .
community said it had won the legal campaign to gain its members thousands of pounds in compensation .
the union said an employment tribunal has upheld its claim that the workforce was not given a mandatory 90-day consultation period over the job losses in july 2002 .
michael leahy , community 's general secretary , said : " our original legal advice was we could not pursue the case but we sought a second opinion , which said that we did have a case .
" after three years , during which time we lost an original tribunal -lsb- then -rsb- won an appeal , we have finally won compensation on their behalf . "
a union spokesman said the judgment was likely to mean " some thousands " for some of its members .
pension funds around 800 workers at asw in cardiff lost most of their occupational pensions , as well as their jobs , when the firm collapsed .
a total of 300 workers were also made redundant at asw 's sheerness plant in kent .
community has begun a claim for similar compensation for them .
community , with amicus , is currently taking legal action against the uk government on behalf of 1,000 former asw workers over two pension funds which were left in deficit by asw 's crash .
asw 's administrators , kpmg , said the compensation ruling was against asw and the money would come from the sale of the company 's assets .

british trust for ornithology research biologist dave glue said : " the four main food items taken by barn owls are field vole , wood mouse , brown rat and common shrew .
" last winter there was an exceptional glut of wild fruits , including beech mast and haws , which was great news for these mammals .
" the rodents in turn provide a ready food supply for barn owls . "
the success was highlighted in the bbc two programme springwatch barn owls , which followed the progress of five young owls at the fishleigh estate , devon .

the government pledged to reduce the inequality gap - measured by infant mortality and life expectancy - by 10 % between 1997 and 2010 .
but latest figures show that on both counts the gap between the poorest and population as a whole has increased .
the report by a government advisory group said progress had been made on child poverty and improving housing .
the scientific reference group of health inequalities study also said the gap had narrowed for cancer and heart disease death rates . "
without tackling wealth inequalities , which are widening , it is not going to be able to tackle health inequalities " professor danny dorling , health inequalities expert group chairman professor sir michael marmot said the reduction in child poverty already seen - from 1999 to 2004 it fell from 24 % to 20 % - would lead to a reduction in health inequalities , but not by 2010 .
" this report gives no grounds for complacency that enough has yet been done . "
but speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , he said the figures needed to be set against " dramatic improvements " in the overall health of all social groups over the last 100 years .
" we 'd still like it to be as good in the worst off groups as it is in the best - and it 's improved more rapidly in the best off than it has in the worst off - but it 's improved dramatically right across the board , " he added .
to tackle inequality the government needed to look at " the circumstances in which people live and work , and the ways we raise our children , the standards of education " , he said .
have your say " there is a huge misconception that healthy eating is expensive " karen , southampton , england send us your comments the department of health-commissioned report found the gap in life expectancy between the bottom fifth and the population as a whole had widened by 2 % for males and 5 % for females between 1997-9 and 2001-3 .
the shift means the life expectancy in the wealthiest areas is seven to eight years longer than the poorest areas .
the gap in the infant mortality rate was 19 % higher in 2001-3 between the poorest and general population , compared to 13 % higher in 1997-9 .
health inequalities expert danny dorling , professor of human geography at the university of sheffield , said he was not surprised by the findings .
wealth " the government has some nice schemes , but without tackling wealth inequalities , which are widening , it is not going to be able to tackle health inequalities .
" this is the first labour government that has failed to narrow the gap .
it is astonishing after eight years and making reducing health inequality a key target that we are in this position . "

" it shows encouraging signs that we are moving in the right direction on some of the problems associated with health inequalities . "
she also unveiled the first 12 areas to get personalised health trainers , a scheme first unveiled in november 's public health white paper .
each area will be given £ 200,000 to provide personalised plans for people to improve their health and prevent diseases such as cancer and heart disease .
initially targeted at the most deprived areas , the scheme will be rolled out to the rest of england by 2007 .

it is their first opportunity to put into practice what they have learned on a summer school at the football club designed to improve their literacy and computer skills .
chloe shields is a full-time professional player with west ham ladies , and tony cesay is an england international boxer .
they are questioned on their sporting successes and failures , and their outside interests - the usual line of questioning perhaps , but with the directness characteristic of children .
pupils on this week-long course will create their own magazine about west ham , using their research and interviews .
chloe shields said she was impressed by their attitude and was able to pass on some ideas .
" some of these kids are young enough to be able to take the path i did if that 's what they want .
" they have to keep motivated and keep working at things . "
west ham is doing a lot to assist learning in the community , she added .
' less scared ' joanne , 13 , seems to have thrived in an environment where she has had more attention than in school .
" sometimes i get a bit scared to ask for help at school in case people laugh , " she said .
" i 've had a lot more time to focus on things here and i do n't worry about getting things wrong .
" i might be less scared to ask for help once i 'm back at school . "
she has picked up skills she can easily transfer to her academic work .
" i would n't say i was very confident with computers , though i 'm ok at typing .
" i 've now learned how to use different types of software , for example for creating pictures - i did n't know how to use any before . "
west ham 's learning zone , where the course is held , provides a space for pupils from newham 's schools to work on their computer skills , reading and writing .
it is staffed by qualified teachers and learning mentors .
it provides summer schools out of term , but during term time local schools nominate children who could take advantage of the centre 's facilities for a 10-week course .
newham council encourages children to take part in up to three summer courses during the holidays .
the west ham project is part of the government 's playing for success initiative , which seeks to link sport and learning .
education minister bill rammell looked delighted with his personalised west ham shirt , which the students produced .
he said sport and other activities could provide a spark which stimulates learning .
" it 's about using the passion children have for sport to get them into learning - reading and writing and using ict .
" the clear evidence from local authorities is that these courses do work - and lead to longer-term sustainable progression in performance .
" we 've seen the benefits across the board - not just with specific groups of children . "
the government wants to extend learning beyond school hours through such after-school projects , and plans to create " extended schools " across england .
better than school ?
students at west ham say the project has been a fun way to learn , and tutors on the course say they are pleased with the response from the participants .
but do such fun summer schools only serve to deepen some pupils ' impression that normal school is dull ?
not according to mr rammell .
" once someone develops an interest in reading they will go forward with it .
what you need to find is the key .
" whatever it is , be it football or something else , young people will go on and continue to be interested . "
for 12-year-old elyas visiting the team changing rooms was a particular highlight of the week .
" school is a little bit boring , " he said .
" there 's nothing wrong with school but this is more fun .
" i 've learned a lot about computers , but also about football .
i do think you get more skills from school though . "
elyas proudly displays his front cover of his magazine and the techniques he used to design it .
" i chose this course because i thought it would be interesting to make a magazine and it would teach me a lot - plus you get to look around the club and meet the players . "

they are questioned on their sporting successes and failures , and their outside interests - the usual line of questioning perhaps , but with the directness characteristic of children .
pupils on this week-long course will create their own magazine about west ham , using their research and interviews .
chloe shields said she was impressed by their attitude and was able to pass on some ideas .
" some of these kids are young enough to be able to take the path i did if that 's what they want .
" they have to keep motivated and keep working at things . "
west ham is doing a lot to assist learning in the community , she added .
' less scared ' joanne , 13 , seems to have thrived in an environment where she has had more attention than in school .
" sometimes i get a bit scared to ask for help at school in case people laugh , " she said .
" i 've had a lot more time to focus on things here and i do n't worry about getting things wrong .
" i might be less scared to ask for help once i 'm back at school . "
she has picked up skills she can easily transfer to her academic work .
students spend a week working towards making their own magazine " i would n't say i was very confident with computers , though i 'm ok at typing .
" i 've now learned how to use different types of software , for example for creating pictures - i did n't know how to use any before . "
west ham 's learning zone , where the course is held , provides a space for pupils from newham 's schools to work on their computer skills , reading and writing .
it is staffed by qualified teachers and learning mentors .
it provides summer schools out of term , but during term time local schools nominate children who could take advantage of the centre 's facilities for a 10-week course .
newham council encourages children to take part in up to three summer courses during the holidays .
the west ham project is part of the government 's playing for success initiative , which seeks to link sport and learning .
education minister bill rammell looked delighted with his personalised west ham shirt , which the students produced .
he said sport and other activities could provide a spark which stimulates learning .
" it 's about using the passion children have for sport to get them into learning - reading and writing and using ict .
" the clear evidence from local authorities is that these courses do work - and lead to longer-term sustainable progression in performance .
" we 've seen the benefits across the board - not just with specific groups of children . "
the government wants to extend learning beyond school hours through such after-school projects , and plans to create " extended schools " across england .
better than school ?
students at west ham say the project has been a fun way to learn , and tutors on the course say they are pleased with the response from the participants .
but do such fun summer schools only serve to deepen some pupils ' impression that normal school is dull ?
not according to mr rammell .
" once someone develops an interest in reading they will go forward with it .
what you need to find is the key .
" whatever it is , be it football or something else , young people will go on and continue to be interested . "
for 12-year-old elyas visiting the team changing rooms was a particular highlight of the week .
" school is a little bit boring , " he said .
some of the students appeared to be nervous before their interviews " there 's nothing wrong with school but this is more fun .
" i 've learned a lot about computers , but also about football .
i do think you get more skills from school though . "
elyas proudly displays his front cover of his magazine and the techniques he used to design it .
" i chose this course because i thought it would be interesting to make a magazine and it would teach me a lot - plus you get to look around the club and meet the players . "

in 2001 , 19,052 people were caught driving without insurance .
two years later , this figure rose to 26,797 .
the rise is double the national average .
lib dems said the figures , from parliamentary answers , could mean more motorists were flouting the law or police were better at catching them .
the party called for higher fines and loss of licences for uninsured drivers .
london assembly liberal democrat transport spokesperson , geoff pope , said the figures were a " double-edged sword " .
cars crushed " it could be that the police are doing more to catch these reckless criminals who put the lives of others at risk .
equally it could be that there are more people willing to flout the law and hope they can get away without paying for their insurance , " he said .
" fines are far too low and in many cases much less than the insurance premium and there ought to be an expectation of losing your licence . "
a met police spokesman said new powers introduced in july now mean vehicles of uninsured drivers can be taken from them and crushed unless proof of insurance is provided within seven days .
no details were available from the police of particular crackdowns from 2001-3 .
the number of uninsured drivers caught across england and wales also increased over the same period by 20 % .

the department 's press office had " strongly advised against any publicity " and the memo went on to warn mr clarke he was " not prepared to take those risks " .
" we recommend that you delay any media announcement until interim results significantly improve , " it added .
mr clarke 's predecessor , david blunkett , said the pilot scheme was a " prison without bars " when he launched it in hampshire , the west midlands and manchester last september .
in manchester the technology was used for sex offenders , in hampshire and the west midlands for people who committed offences of domestic violence and for prolific offenders .
' canyon effect ' up to 120 offenders were due to be fitted with satellite tags which were claimed to pinpoint their exact location 24 hours a day .
the leaked report to the home secretary said : " if the subject is between tall buildings , a canyon effect can prevent accurate location .
" leaf cover and cloud cover can mask the strength of the signal .
" location can not be obtained on planes , some intercity trains and the underground .
" location is usually lost inside buildings . "
no early releases a statement released by the home office on thursday stressed the pilot projects were not just sex offender programmes and that tracking was " not a replacement for any other form of supervision " .
it added : " offenders being tracked have either received a community order , or in most cases , been released on licence from prison .
they have not been released early from prison . "
the department acknowledged the " technology is not perfect " but added that technological advances could mean there was an increased likelihood of obtaining a signal in " adverse conditions outside " .
" in the last few months the number of those on tracking has increased substantially as confidence has grown amongst practitioners .
an extension to the scheme was proposed to build on that progress and ensure sufficient data was obtained from the pilot . "
alarm a full evaluation is being carried out and is due to report in march 2006 .
the system features electronic ankle tags with a wireless connection to a mobile phone which is suppose to be carried by offenders at all times and sends back co-ordinates to a tracking station .
if the phone is separated from the tag it sets off an alarm , which is also supposed to alert the authorities if a criminal approaches a forbidden area - for example a paedophile going near a playground .
in may 2004 , mr blunkett said satellite tracking would mean " a more secure system and people can rest more securely in their beds " .
