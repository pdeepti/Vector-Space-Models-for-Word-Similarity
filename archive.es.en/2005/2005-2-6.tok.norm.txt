the station is using a download portal that was partially developed by the creators of the mp3 digital music format that allows artists or music labels to upload their own songs and set their own prices . no copy protection the system , known as potato , could make it difficult to get the songs from better-known artists since it operates without digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- copy protection , which the major labels require to limit music piracy .
however , with the station 's focus on independent artists and new music , that may not be much of an issue to most motorfm listeners who are hoping to escape mainstream radio in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner but renner 's vision is bigger than simply offering online downloads .
he said motorfm 's ultimate goal is to make it possible for listeners to purchase a song heard on the radio by simply sending an sms text message from their mobile phone .
the song would then be automatically sent to the listener 's motorfm account . the station is also hoping to break from the traditional radio formats by cutting out tired morning shows and other pointless talk and chatter .
the dj will instead concentrate on the music , offering only insights that add value to what the listeners are hearing .
clearly , motorfm will be radio for hardcore music fans . " there wo n't be anything that 's playing on the hit parade , " station music director thomas müller told die welt newspaper . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry sues european internet pirates the music industry has targeted 459 prolific " uploaders " in austria , denmark , france , germany , italy and the uk , who they accuse of illegally providing their music collections to others on online file-sharing networks .

bavarian premier edmund stoiber threw a hot coal into the debate over right-wing extremism by blaming the government for the resurgence of radicals by allowing unemployment to hit levels not seen since the 1930s . in comments published in the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and former chancellor candidate in the 2002 general elections criticized chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government for not doing enough to get the economy on track and reduce unemployment . by neglecting these key areas , schröder is to blame for the resurgence of the far-right in the economically depressed eastern states , stoiber said , referring to the strength of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony , which garnered nearly 10 percent of the vote in last year ’ s state elections . citing the recent announcement of jobless figures above five million , the opposition politician said it was the first time germany had so many unemployed people since the great depression .
the country is in a situation it has “ not seen since 1932 ” , when mass unemployment helped create the conditions for hitler ’ s nazi party to come to power a year later , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu party leader edmund stoiber “ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates a breeding ground for extremists who exploit people ’ s lack of prospects and threaten democracy in our country , ” the bavarian premier said . fighting off the right and far-right in order to prevent the far-right from gaining even more followers , the government must reduce the unemployment levels , opposition leader angela merkel said saturday in n24 television . the best method to combat extremism from the left and from the right is a “ sensible economic situation , ” the christian democrat union leader said and pointed out that the chancellor and his government had so far been unable to do this . schröder ’ s government and party condemned the comments and deplored the comparison to pre-nazi germany .

the democrats in germany – from all parties – must act together with resolve to show they are committed to opposing right-wing extremism , he said . the sonntag-express warned in its sunday editorial “ it is a dangerous game that the opposition is playing .

bavarian premier edmund stoiber threw a hot coal into the debate over right-wing extremism by blaming the government for the resurgence of radicals by allowing unemployment to hit levels not seen since the 1930s . in comments published in the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and former chancellor candidate in the 2002 general elections criticized chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government for not doing enough to get the economy on track and reduce unemployment . by neglecting these key areas , schröder is to blame for the resurgence of the far-right in the economically depressed eastern states , stoiber said , referring to the strength of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony , which garnered nearly 10 percent of the vote in last year ’ s state elections . citing the recent announcement of jobless figures above five million , the opposition politician said it was the first time germany had so many unemployed people since the great depression .
the country is in a situation it has “ not seen since 1932 ” , when mass unemployment helped create the conditions for hitler ’ s nazi party to come to power a year later , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu party leader edmund stoiber “ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates a breeding ground for extremists who exploit people ’ s lack of prospects and threaten democracy in our country , ” the bavarian premier said . fighting off the right and far-right in order to prevent the far-right from gaining even more followers , the government must reduce the unemployment levels , opposition leader angela merkel said saturday in n24 television . the best method to combat extremism from the left and from the right is a “ sensible economic situation , ” the christian democrat union leader said and pointed out that the chancellor and his government had so far been unable to do this . schröder ’ s government and party condemned the comments and deplored the comparison to pre-nazi germany .
social democrat party leader franz münterfering said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an npd rally in essen in 2000 “ only the voters are to blame , ” he said and added that an inter-party fight over who is to blame for the npd would only serve to make the nazis stronger .
the democrats in germany – from all parties – must act together with resolve to show they are committed to opposing right-wing extremism , he said . the sonntag-express warned in its sunday editorial “ it is a dangerous game that the opposition is playing .
if democrats like stoiber start to blame democrats like schröder for the successes of the npd , extremists will clap their hands in joy . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fights right-wing extremism german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.02.2005 radio to download großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorfm broadcasts independent music across berlin a new berlin radio station is hoping to revolutionize the country 's music industry with a fresh format that drops commercials for legal song downloads . once a major player at a major music label , tim renner at some point decided the industry could n't be saved from within .
frustrated by universal music 's decision to promote easily marketed and packaged international music acts at the expense of local artists , he left his well-paying job at the company 's german division in 2004 . instead of fighting the industry from the inside , he and his partners at the indie label motor are hoping to revolutionize it from the outside .
starting feb .
1 , the new berlin radio station motorfm broadcasts with a new format and business concept including online music downloads . focusing on cutting-edge indie and alternative rock , pop , hip-hop and electronic music , the station eschews traditional radio advertising for part of the revenue from downloads and targeted sponsoring of its programming .
eventually , motorfm aims to have every song it plays available to purchase from its motor.de web site . " radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , radio is the most mobile medium there is .
and it makes sense to use that with the strengths of the internet , " renner told dw-world in a recent interview . the number of songs on offer to start is small , but motorfm aims to continually add to its library .
the station is using a download portal that was partially developed by the creators of the mp3 digital music format that allows artists or music labels to upload their own songs and set their own prices . no copy protection the system , known as potato , could make it difficult to get the songs from better-known artists since it operates without digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- copy protection , which the major labels require to limit music piracy .
however , with the station 's focus on independent artists and new music , that may not be much of an issue to most motorfm listeners who are hoping to escape mainstream radio in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner but renner 's vision is bigger than simply offering online downloads .
he said motorfm 's ultimate goal is to make it possible for listeners to purchase a song heard on the radio by simply sending an sms text message from their mobile phone .
the song would then be automatically sent to the listener 's motorfm account . the station is also hoping to break from the traditional radio formats by cutting out tired morning shows and other pointless talk and chatter .
the dj will instead concentrate on the music , offering only insights that add value to what the listeners are hearing .
clearly , motorfm will be radio for hardcore music fans . " there wo n't be anything that 's playing on the hit parade , " station music director thomas müller told die welt newspaper . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry sues european internet pirates the music industry has targeted 459 prolific " uploaders " in austria , denmark , france , germany , italy and the uk , who they accuse of illegally providing their music collections to others on online file-sharing networks .

the birthplace of german downhill skiing , oberwiesenthal itself is now being reborn as a modern resort . once called the " st. moritz of saxony , " oberwiesenthal , in the erzgebirge region on the czech border , has undergone a number of changes over the years .
the site of the country ’ s first aerial tram , and home to an organized ski club as early as the turn of the century , oberwiesenthal stayed a hot ski destination in the days of the german democratic republic only to fall on harder times after reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberwiesenthal is germany 's highest city oberwiesenthal can be reached either by car or by the fichtelberg train , a narrow-gauge steam engine that leaves from the nearby town of cranzahl .
the scenic , hour-long ride covers a 238-meter increase in altitude , crossing seven bridges and an imposing , 110-meter long viaduct on the way to its destination . all thanks to norway ? the fichtelberg train was created at the end of the 19th century , when the last traces of the area ’ s once generous ore supplies were being mined -lrb- erzgebirge translates to english as ‘ ore mountains . ’ -rrb-
at the same time , skiing was introduced to the area as a leisure sport .
a norwegian engineer taught ski racing to the local youths , and in 1906 , a ski club was founded . by 1911 , the germany-wide ski racing finals were being held in oberwiesenthal .
in 1924 the town built the country ’ s first aerial cable car to the 1,214 meter high fichtelberg mountain .
since 1983 , the ski and homeland museum in oberwiesenthal has provided visitors information on the development of skiing in saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' skeleton ' racing is a variation on sledding and only recently became an olympic sport today oberwiesenthal is the home base for many winter sports .
several professional teams train in the area , and tourists from germany 's eastern states frequent the region when the hills and valleys are covered in thick snow . home of champions during the cold war era , oberwiesenthal was renowned as a training ground for young skiers .
athletes from the erzgebirg have won 30 olympic medals and 57 world championship titles in the area of winter sports .
among the best known are ulrich wehling , three-time olympic winner and world champion in the nordic combination , and jens weißflog , three-time olympic winner and two-time ski jumping champ .
as recently as the 2002 winter olympics , oberwiesenthal athletes took home three medals . for forty years after world war ii , the resorts were booked solid , both in winter -lrb- ski vacations -rrb- and summer -lrb- climbing and hiking -rrb- .
but after the fall of the wall , oberwiesenthal lost its cachet .
many tourists , especially those from the former east , considered it dull and middle-class .
like all vacation areas and regions in the new german states , oberwiesenthal suddenly had to stake out a place for itself in a completely different tourism market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for people looking for skiing without a lot of crowds , oberwiesenthal may be the answer but the last decade has seen feverish - and mostly successful – rejuvenation efforts .
in a push to bring amenities up to western standards , there are fewer hotels and resorts in the region , but most of those that remain were revamped into two , three and four-star properties .
families and those looking for a winter vacation outside the usual of high-priced and over-booked alpine resorts , are discovering the benefits of oberwiesenthal . town of typical toys oberwiesenthal has 3,500 inhabitants , and there are an equal number of guest accommodations .
the ski area is on the small side , with two chair lifts and drag-lifts , ten prepared trails and 100 kilometers of cross country trails .
and while it is no longer the site of the german ski champioinships , important germany-wide competitions in biathlon and snowboarding , as well as a speed skating race and a legendary ski carnival , take place here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden toys and christmas decorations from the erzgebirge are sold throughout the world the erzgebirge region is known to many outside of germany for its typical christmas products .
local artisans carve wooden ornaments , candle-angels , creche figures and nutrcrackers all year round .
when taking a break from all the skiing , skating and sledding , another favorite passtime is to watch the toymakers and wheelwrights at work . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harz mountains : historic , romantic , athletic forest-covered mountains , moors , cliffs , rolling hills , deep gorges - the landscape of the harz is nothing if not varied .
and it is one of germany ’ s most tradition-steeped regions .
warm weather leaves skiers high and dry the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts .
striking gold with christmas the mountains near the eastern german village of seiffen have long been emptied of their tin and silver , but the people there have found a sustainable gold mine instead : christmas .

frustrated by universal music 's decision to promote easily marketed and packaged international music acts at the expense of local artists , he left his well-paying job at the company 's german division in 2004 . instead of fighting the industry from the inside , he and his partners at the indie label motor are hoping to revolutionize it from the outside .

eventually , motorfm aims to have every song it plays available to purchase from its motor.de web site . " radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , radio is the most mobile medium there is .
and it makes sense to use that with the strengths of the internet , " renner told dw-world in a recent interview . the number of songs on offer to start is small , but motorfm aims to continually add to its library .
the station is using a download portal that was partially developed by the creators of the mp3 digital music format that allows artists or music labels to upload their own songs and set their own prices . no copy protection the system , known as potato , could make it difficult to get the songs from better-known artists since it operates without digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- copy protection , which the major labels require to limit music piracy .

he said motorfm 's ultimate goal is to make it possible for listeners to purchase a song heard on the radio by simply sending an sms text message from their mobile phone .
the song would then be automatically sent to the listener 's motorfm account . the station is also hoping to break from the traditional radio formats by cutting out tired morning shows and other pointless talk and chatter .
the dj will instead concentrate on the music , offering only insights that add value to what the listeners are hearing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.02.2005 radio to download großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorfm broadcasts independent music across berlin a new berlin radio station is hoping to revolutionize the country 's music industry with a fresh format that drops commercials for legal song downloads . once a major player at a major music label , tim renner at some point decided the industry could n't be saved from within .
frustrated by universal music 's decision to promote easily marketed and packaged international music acts at the expense of local artists , he left his well-paying job at the company 's german division in 2004 . instead of fighting the industry from the inside , he and his partners at the indie label motor are hoping to revolutionize it from the outside .
starting feb .
1 , the new berlin radio station motorfm broadcasts with a new format and business concept including online music downloads . focusing on cutting-edge indie and alternative rock , pop , hip-hop and electronic music , the station eschews traditional radio advertising for part of the revenue from downloads and targeted sponsoring of its programming .
eventually , motorfm aims to have every song it plays available to purchase from its motor.de web site . " radio stations could be the retailers of tomorrow , radio is the most mobile medium there is .
and it makes sense to use that with the strengths of the internet , " renner told dw-world in a recent interview . the number of songs on offer to start is small , but motorfm aims to continually add to its library .
the station is using a download portal that was partially developed by the creators of the mp3 digital music format that allows artists or music labels to upload their own songs and set their own prices . no copy protection the system , known as potato , could make it difficult to get the songs from better-known artists since it operates without digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- copy protection , which the major labels require to limit music piracy .
however , with the station 's focus on independent artists and new music , that may not be much of an issue to most motorfm listeners who are hoping to escape mainstream radio in the first place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim renner but renner 's vision is bigger than simply offering online downloads .
he said motorfm 's ultimate goal is to make it possible for listeners to purchase a song heard on the radio by simply sending an sms text message from their mobile phone .
the song would then be automatically sent to the listener 's motorfm account . the station is also hoping to break from the traditional radio formats by cutting out tired morning shows and other pointless talk and chatter .
the dj will instead concentrate on the music , offering only insights that add value to what the listeners are hearing .
clearly , motorfm will be radio for hardcore music fans . " there wo n't be anything that 's playing on the hit parade , " station music director thomas müller told die welt newspaper . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de music industry sues european internet pirates the music industry has targeted 459 prolific " uploaders " in austria , denmark , france , germany , italy and the uk , who they accuse of illegally providing their music collections to others on online file-sharing networks .

bavarian premier edmund stoiber threw a hot coal into the debate over right-wing extremism by blaming the government for the resurgence of radicals by allowing unemployment to hit levels not seen since the 1930s . in comments published in the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and former chancellor candidate in the 2002 general elections criticized chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government for not doing enough to get the economy on track and reduce unemployment . by neglecting these key areas , schröder is to blame for the resurgence of the far-right in the economically depressed eastern states , stoiber said , referring to the strength of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony , which garnered nearly 10 percent of the vote in last year ’ s state elections . citing the recent announcement of jobless figures above five million , the opposition politician said it was the first time germany had so many unemployed people since the great depression .
the country is in a situation it has “ not seen since 1932 ” , when mass unemployment helped create the conditions for hitler ’ s nazi party to come to power a year later , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu party leader edmund stoiber “ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates a breeding ground for extremists who exploit people ’ s lack of prospects and threaten democracy in our country , ” the bavarian premier said . fighting off the right and far-right in order to prevent the far-right from gaining even more followers , the government must reduce the unemployment levels , opposition leader angela merkel said saturday in n24 television . the best method to combat extremism from the left and from the right is a “ sensible economic situation , ” the christian democrat union leader said and pointed out that the chancellor and his government had so far been unable to do this . schröder ’ s government and party condemned the comments and deplored the comparison to pre-nazi germany .
social democrat party leader franz münterfering said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an npd rally in essen in 2000 “ only the voters are to blame , ” he said and added that an inter-party fight over who is to blame for the npd would only serve to make the nazis stronger .
the democrats in germany – from all parties – must act together with resolve to show they are committed to opposing right-wing extremism , he said . the sonntag-express warned in its sunday editorial “ it is a dangerous game that the opposition is playing .
if democrats like stoiber start to blame democrats like schröder for the successes of the npd , extremists will clap their hands in joy . ” dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany fights right-wing extremism german president horst köhler has called on all germans to actively oppose anti-semitism , while politicians across the spectrum debate banning the right-wing npd party .

bavarian premier edmund stoiber threw a hot coal into the debate over right-wing extremism by blaming the government for the resurgence of radicals by allowing unemployment to hit levels not seen since the 1930s . in comments published in the sunday newspaper welt am sonntag , the head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and former chancellor candidate in the 2002 general elections criticized chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left government for not doing enough to get the economy on track and reduce unemployment . by neglecting these key areas , schröder is to blame for the resurgence of the far-right in the economically depressed eastern states , stoiber said , referring to the strength of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxony , which garnered nearly 10 percent of the vote in last year ’ s state elections . citing the recent announcement of jobless figures above five million , the opposition politician said it was the first time germany had so many unemployed people since the great depression .
the country is in a situation it has “ not seen since 1932 ” , when mass unemployment helped create the conditions for hitler ’ s nazi party to come to power a year later , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu party leader edmund stoiber “ the failure of schröder ’ s economic policies and the extensive unemployment creates a breeding ground for extremists who exploit people ’ s lack of prospects and threaten democracy in our country , ” the bavarian premier said . fighting off the right and far-right in order to prevent the far-right from gaining even more followers , the government must reduce the unemployment levels , opposition leader angela merkel said saturday in n24 television . the best method to combat extremism from the left and from the right is a “ sensible economic situation , ” the christian democrat union leader said and pointed out that the chancellor and his government had so far been unable to do this . schröder ’ s government and party condemned the comments and deplored the comparison to pre-nazi germany .
social democrat party leader franz münterfering said neither the spd nor the opposition was responsible for the rise of the far-right . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an npd rally in essen in 2000 “ only the voters are to blame , ” he said and added that an inter-party fight over who is to blame for the npd would only serve to make the nazis stronger .
the democrats in germany – from all parties – must act together with resolve to show they are committed to opposing right-wing extremism , he said . the sonntag-express warned in its sunday editorial “ it is a dangerous game that the opposition is playing .

the birthplace of german downhill skiing , oberwiesenthal itself is now being reborn as a modern resort . once called the " st. moritz of saxony , " oberwiesenthal , in the erzgebirge region on the czech border , has undergone a number of changes over the years .
the site of the country ’ s first aerial tram , and home to an organized ski club as early as the turn of the century , oberwiesenthal stayed a hot ski destination in the days of the german democratic republic only to fall on harder times after reunification . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberwiesenthal is germany 's highest city oberwiesenthal can be reached either by car or by the fichtelberg train , a narrow-gauge steam engine that leaves from the nearby town of cranzahl .
the scenic , hour-long ride covers a 238-meter increase in altitude , crossing seven bridges and an imposing , 110-meter long viaduct on the way to its destination . all thanks to norway ? the fichtelberg train was created at the end of the 19th century , when the last traces of the area ’ s once generous ore supplies were being mined -lrb- erzgebirge translates to english as ‘ ore mountains . ’ -rrb-
at the same time , skiing was introduced to the area as a leisure sport .
a norwegian engineer taught ski racing to the local youths , and in 1906 , a ski club was founded . by 1911 , the germany-wide ski racing finals were being held in oberwiesenthal .
in 1924 the town built the country ’ s first aerial cable car to the 1,214 meter high fichtelberg mountain .
since 1983 , the ski and homeland museum in oberwiesenthal has provided visitors information on the development of skiing in saxony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' skeleton ' racing is a variation on sledding and only recently became an olympic sport today oberwiesenthal is the home base for many winter sports .
several professional teams train in the area , and tourists from germany 's eastern states frequent the region when the hills and valleys are covered in thick snow . home of champions during the cold war era , oberwiesenthal was renowned as a training ground for young skiers .
athletes from the erzgebirg have won 30 olympic medals and 57 world championship titles in the area of winter sports .
among the best known are ulrich wehling , three-time olympic winner and world champion in the nordic combination , and jens weißflog , three-time olympic winner and two-time ski jumping champ .
as recently as the 2002 winter olympics , oberwiesenthal athletes took home three medals . for forty years after world war ii , the resorts were booked solid , both in winter -lrb- ski vacations -rrb- and summer -lrb- climbing and hiking -rrb- .
but after the fall of the wall , oberwiesenthal lost its cachet .
many tourists , especially those from the former east , considered it dull and middle-class .
like all vacation areas and regions in the new german states , oberwiesenthal suddenly had to stake out a place for itself in a completely different tourism market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for people looking for skiing without a lot of crowds , oberwiesenthal may be the answer but the last decade has seen feverish - and mostly successful – rejuvenation efforts .
in a push to bring amenities up to western standards , there are fewer hotels and resorts in the region , but most of those that remain were revamped into two , three and four-star properties .
families and those looking for a winter vacation outside the usual of high-priced and over-booked alpine resorts , are discovering the benefits of oberwiesenthal . town of typical toys oberwiesenthal has 3,500 inhabitants , and there are an equal number of guest accommodations .
the ski area is on the small side , with two chair lifts and drag-lifts , ten prepared trails and 100 kilometers of cross country trails .
and while it is no longer the site of the german ski champioinships , important germany-wide competitions in biathlon and snowboarding , as well as a speed skating race and a legendary ski carnival , take place here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wooden toys and christmas decorations from the erzgebirge are sold throughout the world the erzgebirge region is known to many outside of germany for its typical christmas products .
local artisans carve wooden ornaments , candle-angels , creche figures and nutrcrackers all year round .
when taking a break from all the skiing , skating and sledding , another favorite passtime is to watch the toymakers and wheelwrights at work . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harz mountains : historic , romantic , athletic forest-covered mountains , moors , cliffs , rolling hills , deep gorges - the landscape of the harz is nothing if not varied .

warm weather leaves skiers high and dry the german ski industry has hit a bump this year , as record warm temperatures for january melted snow at the country 's many lower-lying resorts .
striking gold with christmas the mountains near the eastern german village of seiffen have long been emptied of their tin and silver , but the people there have found a sustainable gold mine instead : christmas .

the british trust for ornithology -lrb- bto -rrb- is urging people to put up nesting boxes to help the birds this spring .
data collected for the trust 's ringing scheme , showed 2004 was a productive year for blue tits , many of whom will now be looking for their first homes .
but natural nest sites , such as holes in trees and buildings , vanish as woods are tidied and houses are repaired .
nest box week once a bird has found a place to nest it may return for several seasons .
the bto is organising national nest box week - to be celebrated between 14 and 21 february - in a bid to persuade people to put up nest boxes this spring .
according to bto nest record scheme data , blue tits have an average of just over seven chicks per nest , with each chick being fed about 100 times each day .
it is thought that between hatching and fledging the average blue tit family will eat about 10,000 invertebrates .
the bto says that encouraging blue tits to nest in the garden could provide an ecologically friendly form of pest control .

the british trust for ornithology -lrb- bto -rrb- is urging people to put up nesting boxes to help the birds this spring .
data collected for the trust 's ringing scheme , showed 2004 was a productive year for blue tits , many of whom will now be looking for their first homes .
but natural nest sites , such as holes in trees and buildings , vanish as woods are tidied and houses are repaired .
nest box week once a bird has found a place to nest it may return for several seasons .
the bto is organising national nest box week - to be celebrated between 14 and 21 february - in a bid to persuade people to put up nest boxes this spring .
according to bto nest record scheme data , blue tits have an average of just over seven chicks per nest , with each chick being fed about 100 times each day .
it is thought that between hatching and fledging the average blue tit family will eat about 10,000 invertebrates .
the bto says that encouraging blue tits to nest in the garden could provide an ecologically friendly form of pest control .
