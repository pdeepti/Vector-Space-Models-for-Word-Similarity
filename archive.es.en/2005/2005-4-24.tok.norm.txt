program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.04.2005 ring-tone maestros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the repertoire is growing by leaps and bounds ring tones can be heard just about everywhere in our modern world .
while some would like them outlawed , they generate big revenues and even jobs , since someone has to write the bleeping melodies . they pop up everywhere , on the street , in the office , in the cinema , during a performance of the adagio section of your favorite chopin concerto .
to some , ring tones from mobile phones are enough to drive someone to commit murder .
but to others , like the munich-based band supersmart , they 're beautiful music . that 's because the musicians in supersmart compose only for mobile phones ; they 're the first band in germany to do so .
they create ring tones of no more then half a minute in length , which can be downloaded off the internet .
a complete album of the mini melodies can be bought for 1.99 euros -lrb- $ 2.59 -rrb- . " we 're a good combo who has fun with music and we do n't want to run after the labels , " said good cut from supersmart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-mighty record labels came close to spoiling the fun for supersmart , and they criticize the current state of the music industry .
most songs today are consumer products , developed and even co-written by market researchers and trend consultants .
none should be longer than three-and-a-half minutes ; the chorus should arrive within the first 45 seconds , and if it ’ s a ballad , throw some violins in there , please . the four guys from supersmart know this first hand since several of them play in other , better-known bands .
some of their contracts forbid them from participating in side projects , so in their supersmart manifestation they prefer to remain anonymous .
the band exists only in the internet and , of course , on the mobile phone .
they consider their ring-tone compositions a bit of creative freedom outside of the confines of the mainstream music industry . symphony for the cell despite the sometimes grating aspect of them , ring tones can be difficult to compose , as the commercial ring-tone providers know all too well .
hubert weid is with the cologne-based mobile entertainment factory , a company which produces ring tones for the sector 's market leader , jamba . " we generally only work with musicians who have a classical training , " he said . andreas , a music student , is the chief composer in weid 's firm .
his job is to make ring tones out of current chart hits .
it 's not as creative an endeavor as , for example , supersmart 's original work , but it 's probably just as challenging .
the difficulty lies in the fact that mobile phones can not simply play a song like a cd player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because of the sound limitations and the reduced number of sound tracks available on a mobile phone , andreas has to essentially " compose down , " simplifying songs without losing their essence or making them unrecognizable .
it might be compared to writing a piano version of an entire symphony . most of the time , he decides on what part of the song to focus on for the ring tone , usually the chorus .
then the real work starts .
he must listen to every voice - vocal , bass , strings - extremely carefully and enter them into a computer note for note .
after about an hour and a half , the song has generally been combed through ; the ring tone is ready . laptop jamming supersmart works somewhat differently .
the members usually jam together late into the night like other bands , but instead of have guitars slung across their shoulders , they 're sitting on a couch with laptop computers on their laps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've completed a ring tone and put it online , there 's generally more fiddling around with it , but this time by internet users . " we learn from our fans .
there 's a little community out there that is incredibly creative and really helps us out , " said good cut .
" they tell us when , say , their siemens mobile phone will allow us to push the pitch of one part a little higher . " in a few weeks , the band will release a ring-tone album , complete with videos to every track , specially filmed to be displayed on mobile phone screens .
that 's because supersmart is sure that some day , maybe soon , the mobile phone will not only have replaced the record and cd player , but the television as well . kerstin hilt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the age of cellulus interruptus for 22 percent of germans , it seems it does n't matter how hot and heavy the sex is , when the mobile phone rings , they 're answering it - even in the middle of the act .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .

they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .

" during those sad days of the pope 's illness and death , it became wonderfully evident to us that the church is alive .
and the church is young , " he said , answered by a great welling of applause from the massive , flag-waving crowd . " she holds within herself the future of the world and therefore shows each of us the way towards the future , " said the pope . appeal for christian unity in his message , the pope appealed for the unity of christian churches , saying there should be " one flock , one shepherd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.04.2005 ring-tone maestros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the repertoire is growing by leaps and bounds ring tones can be heard just about everywhere in our modern world .
while some would like them outlawed , they generate big revenues and even jobs , since someone has to write the bleeping melodies . they pop up everywhere , on the street , in the office , in the cinema , during a performance of the adagio section of your favorite chopin concerto .
to some , ring tones from mobile phones are enough to drive someone to commit murder .
but to others , like the munich-based band supersmart , they 're beautiful music . that 's because the musicians in supersmart compose only for mobile phones ; they 're the first band in germany to do so .
they create ring tones of no more then half a minute in length , which can be downloaded off the internet .
a complete album of the mini melodies can be bought for 1.99 euros -lrb- $ 2.59 -rrb- . " we 're a good combo who has fun with music and we do n't want to run after the labels , " said good cut from supersmart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-mighty record labels came close to spoiling the fun for supersmart , and they criticize the current state of the music industry .
most songs today are consumer products , developed and even co-written by market researchers and trend consultants .
none should be longer than three-and-a-half minutes ; the chorus should arrive within the first 45 seconds , and if it ’ s a ballad , throw some violins in there , please . the four guys from supersmart know this first hand since several of them play in other , better-known bands .
some of their contracts forbid them from participating in side projects , so in their supersmart manifestation they prefer to remain anonymous .
the band exists only in the internet and , of course , on the mobile phone .
they consider their ring-tone compositions a bit of creative freedom outside of the confines of the mainstream music industry . symphony for the cell despite the sometimes grating aspect of them , ring tones can be difficult to compose , as the commercial ring-tone providers know all too well .
hubert weid is with the cologne-based mobile entertainment factory , a company which produces ring tones for the sector 's market leader , jamba . " we generally only work with musicians who have a classical training , " he said . andreas , a music student , is the chief composer in weid 's firm .
his job is to make ring tones out of current chart hits .
it 's not as creative an endeavor as , for example , supersmart 's original work , but it 's probably just as challenging .
the difficulty lies in the fact that mobile phones can not simply play a song like a cd player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because of the sound limitations and the reduced number of sound tracks available on a mobile phone , andreas has to essentially " compose down , " simplifying songs without losing their essence or making them unrecognizable .
it might be compared to writing a piano version of an entire symphony . most of the time , he decides on what part of the song to focus on for the ring tone , usually the chorus .
then the real work starts .
he must listen to every voice - vocal , bass , strings - extremely carefully and enter them into a computer note for note .
after about an hour and a half , the song has generally been combed through ; the ring tone is ready . laptop jamming supersmart works somewhat differently .
the members usually jam together late into the night like other bands , but instead of have guitars slung across their shoulders , they 're sitting on a couch with laptop computers on their laps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've completed a ring tone and put it online , there 's generally more fiddling around with it , but this time by internet users . " we learn from our fans .
there 's a little community out there that is incredibly creative and really helps us out , " said good cut .
" they tell us when , say , their siemens mobile phone will allow us to push the pitch of one part a little higher . " in a few weeks , the band will release a ring-tone album , complete with videos to every track , specially filmed to be displayed on mobile phone screens .
that 's because supersmart is sure that some day , maybe soon , the mobile phone will not only have replaced the record and cd player , but the television as well . kerstin hilt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the age of cellulus interruptus for 22 percent of germans , it seems it does n't matter how hot and heavy the sex is , when the mobile phone rings , they 're answering it - even in the middle of the act .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .
lately , mannheim police have started to drive away homeless people hanging around the central marketplace . but for one week a year , the marketplace is littered in a very different way : people taking part in the cleaning fair drop their own trash .
tidying up their plastic plates , cutlery and cans will take half an hour , three garbage collectors and two cleaning vans - but still a good investment , officials say .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .
lately , mannheim police have started to drive away homeless people hanging around the central marketplace . but for one week a year , the marketplace is littered in a very different way : people taking part in the cleaning fair drop their own trash .
tidying up their plastic plates , cutlery and cans will take half an hour , three garbage collectors and two cleaning vans - but still a good investment , officials say .

dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .
lately , mannheim police have started to drive away homeless people hanging around the central marketplace . but for one week a year , the marketplace is littered in a very different way : people taking part in the cleaning fair drop their own trash .
tidying up their plastic plates , cutlery and cans will take half an hour , three garbage collectors and two cleaning vans - but still a good investment , officials say .

they consider their ring-tone compositions a bit of creative freedom outside of the confines of the mainstream music industry . symphony for the cell despite the sometimes grating aspect of them , ring tones can be difficult to compose , as the commercial ring-tone providers know all too well .
hubert weid is with the cologne-based mobile entertainment factory , a company which produces ring tones for the sector 's market leader , jamba . " we generally only work with musicians who have a classical training , " he said . andreas , a music student , is the chief composer in weid 's firm .
his job is to make ring tones out of current chart hits .
it 's not as creative an endeavor as , for example , supersmart 's original work , but it 's probably just as challenging .
the difficulty lies in the fact that mobile phones can not simply play a song like a cd player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because of the sound limitations and the reduced number of sound tracks available on a mobile phone , andreas has to essentially " compose down , " simplifying songs without losing their essence or making them unrecognizable .
it might be compared to writing a piano version of an entire symphony . most of the time , he decides on what part of the song to focus on for the ring tone , usually the chorus .
then the real work starts .
he must listen to every voice - vocal , bass , strings - extremely carefully and enter them into a computer note for note .
after about an hour and a half , the song has generally been combed through ; the ring tone is ready . laptop jamming supersmart works somewhat differently .
the members usually jam together late into the night like other bands , but instead of have guitars slung across their shoulders , they 're sitting on a couch with laptop computers on their laps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've completed a ring tone and put it online , there 's generally more fiddling around with it , but this time by internet users . " we learn from our fans .
there 's a little community out there that is incredibly creative and really helps us out , " said good cut .
" they tell us when , say , their siemens mobile phone will allow us to push the pitch of one part a little higher . " in a few weeks , the band will release a ring-tone album , complete with videos to every track , specially filmed to be displayed on mobile phone screens .
that 's because supersmart is sure that some day , maybe soon , the mobile phone will not only have replaced the record and cd player , but the television as well . kerstin hilt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the age of cellulus interruptus for 22 percent of germans , it seems it does n't matter how hot and heavy the sex is , when the mobile phone rings , they 're answering it - even in the middle of the act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2005 mannheim 's own sweeping reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brushing their way to a stronger local economy convinced that litter was driving shoppers and investors away from their city , mannheim inhabitants have taken up the broom and vowed to take back the streets in a bid to kick-start their own economic recovery . for the german retail industry , spring still has not arrived .
for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2005 foreign languages in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third-graders are learning english , and liking it in a drive to better school performance later on , germany is focusing on early childhood education , and in particular , foreign language learning .
but the benefits far outweigh improved scores on report cards . for a long time , early childhood education in germany was seen as a bit of a burden .
the creed among experts was to let children simply be children , and not weigh them down with too much knowledge , too early on in life . but germany 's shockingly poor performance in the international comparative education survey - the pisa study - has prompted experts to think again .
it 's hoped that an emphasis on early childhood learning will help close the gap between germany and other western nations such as canada , denmark and finland , which occupy top spots in the study 's results .
part of the plan involves introducing students to foreign languages starting in the third grade . at an elementary school in bonn , for example , third-graders are taught english with the help of songs and poems .
learning in a way that feels like playing helps the kids to speak their first english sentences at eight years of age . teacher regine siebert speaks slowly and clearly , and is quick to praise and encourage her charges .
during the english lesson , she only uses german if absolutely necessary . " the children react very positively , " she said .
" they 're completely unselfconscious and speak spontaneously .
they learn very quickly , and it 's a lot of fun to teach them . " broadening horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english lessons at an elementary school the children do n't just learn english during the lesson .
at eight or nine years of age , kids tend to view themselves and their surroundings as the axis around which everything else revolves .
but when confronted with a foreign language , it suddenly becomes clear that there 's something else outside their little worlds .
education and child development experts have realized that there are other big advantages associated with early language learning . " children are curious about other things , foreign things , " said education researcher gabriele kniffka of cologne university .
" they like to learn , and our experience in elementary schools shows that children get a lot of joy out of learning another language and getting to grips with a foreign culture .
that can only be a positive thing . " equal footing for immigrant children another benefit of the introducing foreign languages early on has to do with the increasing number of students in german classrooms who come from immigrant families .
in german lessons , these children are often very withdrawn because they lack a background in german .
in english class , however , all the children start out on the same level - and suddenly , there are new faces among the brightest , most active participants . ingrid lommer -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany read dw-world 's education dossier the dumbing down of germany a german politician was roundly criticized recently for commenting that only the " wrong people " were having children in germany .
but he was giving voice to an uncomfortable truth about the country ’ s demographic shift .
-lrb- april 21 , 2005 -rrb- german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .
after schools scored poorly on the second pisa study , a separate report on germany 's kindergartens found that early childhood education ranks low on the priority list .
-lrb- dec.1 , 2004 -rrb- bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .

but the benefits far outweigh improved scores on report cards . for a long time , early childhood education in germany was seen as a bit of a burden .
the creed among experts was to let children simply be children , and not weigh them down with too much knowledge , too early on in life . but germany 's shockingly poor performance in the international comparative education survey - the pisa study - has prompted experts to think again .
it 's hoped that an emphasis on early childhood learning will help close the gap between germany and other western nations such as canada , denmark and finland , which occupy top spots in the study 's results .
part of the plan involves introducing students to foreign languages starting in the third grade . at an elementary school in bonn , for example , third-graders are taught english with the help of songs and poems .
learning in a way that feels like playing helps the kids to speak their first english sentences at eight years of age . teacher regine siebert speaks slowly and clearly , and is quick to praise and encourage her charges .
during the english lesson , she only uses german if absolutely necessary . " the children react very positively , " she said .
" they 're completely unselfconscious and speak spontaneously .
they learn very quickly , and it 's a lot of fun to teach them . " broadening horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english lessons at an elementary school the children do n't just learn english during the lesson .
at eight or nine years of age , kids tend to view themselves and their surroundings as the axis around which everything else revolves .
but when confronted with a foreign language , it suddenly becomes clear that there 's something else outside their little worlds .
education and child development experts have realized that there are other big advantages associated with early language learning . " children are curious about other things , foreign things , " said education researcher gabriele kniffka of cologne university .
" they like to learn , and our experience in elementary schools shows that children get a lot of joy out of learning another language and getting to grips with a foreign culture .
that can only be a positive thing . " equal footing for immigrant children another benefit of the introducing foreign languages early on has to do with the increasing number of students in german classrooms who come from immigrant families .
in german lessons , these children are often very withdrawn because they lack a background in german .
in english class , however , all the children start out on the same level - and suddenly , there are new faces among the brightest , most active participants . ingrid lommer -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de educating germany read dw-world 's education dossier the dumbing down of germany a german politician was roundly criticized recently for commenting that only the " wrong people " were having children in germany .
but he was giving voice to an uncomfortable truth about the country ’ s demographic shift .
-lrb- april 21 , 2005 -rrb- german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .
after schools scored poorly on the second pisa study , a separate report on germany 's kindergartens found that early childhood education ranks low on the priority list .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .

and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .
lately , mannheim police have started to drive away homeless people hanging around the central marketplace . but for one week a year , the marketplace is littered in a very different way : people taking part in the cleaning fair drop their own trash .
tidying up their plastic plates , cutlery and cans will take half an hour , three garbage collectors and two cleaning vans - but still a good investment , officials say .

hubert weid is with the cologne-based mobile entertainment factory , a company which produces ring tones for the sector 's market leader , jamba . " we generally only work with musicians who have a classical training , " he said . andreas , a music student , is the chief composer in weid 's firm .
his job is to make ring tones out of current chart hits .
it 's not as creative an endeavor as , for example , supersmart 's original work , but it 's probably just as challenging .
the difficulty lies in the fact that mobile phones can not simply play a song like a cd player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because of the sound limitations and the reduced number of sound tracks available on a mobile phone , andreas has to essentially " compose down , " simplifying songs without losing their essence or making them unrecognizable .
it might be compared to writing a piano version of an entire symphony . most of the time , he decides on what part of the song to focus on for the ring tone , usually the chorus .
then the real work starts .
he must listen to every voice - vocal , bass , strings - extremely carefully and enter them into a computer note for note .
after about an hour and a half , the song has generally been combed through ; the ring tone is ready . laptop jamming supersmart works somewhat differently .
the members usually jam together late into the night like other bands , but instead of have guitars slung across their shoulders , they 're sitting on a couch with laptop computers on their laps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've completed a ring tone and put it online , there 's generally more fiddling around with it , but this time by internet users . " we learn from our fans .
there 's a little community out there that is incredibly creative and really helps us out , " said good cut .
" they tell us when , say , their siemens mobile phone will allow us to push the pitch of one part a little higher . " in a few weeks , the band will release a ring-tone album , complete with videos to every track , specially filmed to be displayed on mobile phone screens .
that 's because supersmart is sure that some day , maybe soon , the mobile phone will not only have replaced the record and cd player , but the television as well . kerstin hilt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the age of cellulus interruptus for 22 percent of germans , it seems it does n't matter how hot and heavy the sex is , when the mobile phone rings , they 're answering it - even in the middle of the act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2005 mannheim 's own sweeping reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brushing their way to a stronger local economy convinced that litter was driving shoppers and investors away from their city , mannheim inhabitants have taken up the broom and vowed to take back the streets in a bid to kick-start their own economic recovery . for the german retail industry , spring still has not arrived .
for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .
lately , mannheim police have started to drive away homeless people hanging around the central marketplace . but for one week a year , the marketplace is littered in a very different way : people taking part in the cleaning fair drop their own trash .
tidying up their plastic plates , cutlery and cans will take half an hour , three garbage collectors and two cleaning vans - but still a good investment , officials say .

" during those sad days of the pope 's illness and death , it became wonderfully evident to us that the church is alive .

how can i do this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.04.2005 foreign languages in german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : third-graders are learning english , and liking it in a drive to better school performance later on , germany is focusing on early childhood education , and in particular , foreign language learning .
but the benefits far outweigh improved scores on report cards . for a long time , early childhood education in germany was seen as a bit of a burden .
the creed among experts was to let children simply be children , and not weigh them down with too much knowledge , too early on in life . but germany 's shockingly poor performance in the international comparative education survey - the pisa study - has prompted experts to think again .
it 's hoped that an emphasis on early childhood learning will help close the gap between germany and other western nations such as canada , denmark and finland , which occupy top spots in the study 's results .
part of the plan involves introducing students to foreign languages starting in the third grade . at an elementary school in bonn , for example , third-graders are taught english with the help of songs and poems .
learning in a way that feels like playing helps the kids to speak their first english sentences at eight years of age . teacher regine siebert speaks slowly and clearly , and is quick to praise and encourage her charges .
during the english lesson , she only uses german if absolutely necessary . " the children react very positively , " she said .
" they 're completely unselfconscious and speak spontaneously .
they learn very quickly , and it 's a lot of fun to teach them . " broadening horizons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english lessons at an elementary school the children do n't just learn english during the lesson .
at eight or nine years of age , kids tend to view themselves and their surroundings as the axis around which everything else revolves .
but when confronted with a foreign language , it suddenly becomes clear that there 's something else outside their little worlds .

" we are not talking about compensation , this is only about a moral issue , " kocharian told russia 's rossiya television , which is also broadcast in armenia . pressure on turkey ahead of eu talks the row over whether or not to call the killings genocide has embarrassed turkey as it readies for the start of european union accession talks later this year . on friday , french president jacques chirac accompanied kocharian to a paris monument for victims of the massacre , and in germany members of parliament from across the political spectrum appealed to turkey to accept the massacre of armenians as part of its history , saying this would help its eu aspirations . on tuesday , poland joined a list of 15 countries that have officially acknowledged the killings as genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan the decision has drawn protest from ankara , where officials called it " irresponsible , " and said it would hurt relations . however , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- recently proposed the creation of a joint armenian-turkish commission to review the issue , though officials expressed confidence that the study would confirm turkey 's current position . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to turkey : own up to massacre the german parliament has agreed on a resolution that will ask ankara to accept its role in the expulsion and massacre during and after world war i that killed up to 1.5 million armenians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.04.2005 ring-tone maestros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the repertoire is growing by leaps and bounds ring tones can be heard just about everywhere in our modern world .
while some would like them outlawed , they generate big revenues and even jobs , since someone has to write the bleeping melodies . they pop up everywhere , on the street , in the office , in the cinema , during a performance of the adagio section of your favorite chopin concerto .
to some , ring tones from mobile phones are enough to drive someone to commit murder .
but to others , like the munich-based band supersmart , they 're beautiful music . that 's because the musicians in supersmart compose only for mobile phones ; they 're the first band in germany to do so .
they create ring tones of no more then half a minute in length , which can be downloaded off the internet .
a complete album of the mini melodies can be bought for 1.99 euros -lrb- $ 2.59 -rrb- . " we 're a good combo who has fun with music and we do n't want to run after the labels , " said good cut from supersmart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-mighty record labels came close to spoiling the fun for supersmart , and they criticize the current state of the music industry .
most songs today are consumer products , developed and even co-written by market researchers and trend consultants .
none should be longer than three-and-a-half minutes ; the chorus should arrive within the first 45 seconds , and if it ’ s a ballad , throw some violins in there , please . the four guys from supersmart know this first hand since several of them play in other , better-known bands .
some of their contracts forbid them from participating in side projects , so in their supersmart manifestation they prefer to remain anonymous .
the band exists only in the internet and , of course , on the mobile phone .
they consider their ring-tone compositions a bit of creative freedom outside of the confines of the mainstream music industry . symphony for the cell despite the sometimes grating aspect of them , ring tones can be difficult to compose , as the commercial ring-tone providers know all too well .
hubert weid is with the cologne-based mobile entertainment factory , a company which produces ring tones for the sector 's market leader , jamba . " we generally only work with musicians who have a classical training , " he said . andreas , a music student , is the chief composer in weid 's firm .
his job is to make ring tones out of current chart hits .
it 's not as creative an endeavor as , for example , supersmart 's original work , but it 's probably just as challenging .
the difficulty lies in the fact that mobile phones can not simply play a song like a cd player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because of the sound limitations and the reduced number of sound tracks available on a mobile phone , andreas has to essentially " compose down , " simplifying songs without losing their essence or making them unrecognizable .
it might be compared to writing a piano version of an entire symphony . most of the time , he decides on what part of the song to focus on for the ring tone , usually the chorus .
then the real work starts .
he must listen to every voice - vocal , bass , strings - extremely carefully and enter them into a computer note for note .
after about an hour and a half , the song has generally been combed through ; the ring tone is ready . laptop jamming supersmart works somewhat differently .
the members usually jam together late into the night like other bands , but instead of have guitars slung across their shoulders , they 're sitting on a couch with laptop computers on their laps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've completed a ring tone and put it online , there 's generally more fiddling around with it , but this time by internet users . " we learn from our fans .
there 's a little community out there that is incredibly creative and really helps us out , " said good cut .
" they tell us when , say , their siemens mobile phone will allow us to push the pitch of one part a little higher . " in a few weeks , the band will release a ring-tone album , complete with videos to every track , specially filmed to be displayed on mobile phone screens .
that 's because supersmart is sure that some day , maybe soon , the mobile phone will not only have replaced the record and cd player , but the television as well . kerstin hilt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the age of cellulus interruptus for 22 percent of germans , it seems it does n't matter how hot and heavy the sex is , when the mobile phone rings , they 're answering it - even in the middle of the act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2005 mannheim 's own sweeping reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brushing their way to a stronger local economy convinced that litter was driving shoppers and investors away from their city , mannheim inhabitants have taken up the broom and vowed to take back the streets in a bid to kick-start their own economic recovery . for the german retail industry , spring still has not arrived .
for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .
lately , mannheim police have started to drive away homeless people hanging around the central marketplace . but for one week a year , the marketplace is littered in a very different way : people taking part in the cleaning fair drop their own trash .
tidying up their plastic plates , cutlery and cans will take half an hour , three garbage collectors and two cleaning vans - but still a good investment , officials say .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .
lately , mannheim police have started to drive away homeless people hanging around the central marketplace . but for one week a year , the marketplace is littered in a very different way : people taking part in the cleaning fair drop their own trash .
tidying up their plastic plates , cutlery and cans will take half an hour , three garbage collectors and two cleaning vans - but still a good investment , officials say .

here i lay six tulips , the number of deaths in my family at the time of the genocide , " said mikhitar haroutounian , 74 . april 24 marks beginning of massacre on april 24 , 1915 the ottoman turkish authorities arrested some 200 armenian community leaders in the start of what armenia and many other countries contend was an organized genocidal campaign to eliminate ethnic armenians from the ottoman empire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 95-year-old varazdat harutyunyan , who was forced from his family 's home in the eastern city of van and lived for weeks in echmiadzin , remembers an endless procession of burials as thousands died of typhoid , cholera and hunger armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kinsmen perished in orchestrated killings between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire , the predecessor of modern turkey , was falling apart . ankara counters that 300,000 armenians and thousands of turks were killed in " civil strife " during world war i when the armenians rose against their ottoman rulers and sided with invading russian troops . ninety years ago " a crime was committed that had no equals in the history of armenia or all of humanity , it did not even have a name , " kocharian said according to the presidential administration . apology , not compensation sought he called on turkey and the international community to condemn the killings as genocide , adding that the former soviet republic was ready to build " natural " relations with its larger neighbor if it faced up to its history . a mass was to be celebrated later on sunday in yerevan 's saint gregory cathedral , as well as in churches all over armenia , and a minute 's silence was to be observed throughout the country at 7 p.m. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armenian president robert kocharian meanwhile , kocharian -lrb- photo -rrb- made a conciliatory gesture towards ankara , saying his government would not ask for financial compensation for the killings if turkey recognized them as genocidal . " we are not talking about compensation , this is only about a moral issue , " kocharian told russia 's rossiya television , which is also broadcast in armenia . pressure on turkey ahead of eu talks the row over whether or not to call the killings genocide has embarrassed turkey as it readies for the start of european union accession talks later this year . on friday , french president jacques chirac accompanied kocharian to a paris monument for victims of the massacre , and in germany members of parliament from across the political spectrum appealed to turkey to accept the massacre of armenians as part of its history , saying this would help its eu aspirations . on tuesday , poland joined a list of 15 countries that have officially acknowledged the killings as genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan the decision has drawn protest from ankara , where officials called it " irresponsible , " and said it would hurt relations . however , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- recently proposed the creation of a joint armenian-turkish commission to review the issue , though officials expressed confidence that the study would confirm turkey 's current position . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to turkey : own up to massacre the german parliament has agreed on a resolution that will ask ankara to accept its role in the expulsion and massacre during and after world war i that killed up to 1.5 million armenians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2005 mannheim 's own sweeping reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brushing their way to a stronger local economy convinced that litter was driving shoppers and investors away from their city , mannheim inhabitants have taken up the broom and vowed to take back the streets in a bid to kick-start their own economic recovery . for the german retail industry , spring still has not arrived .
for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .
lately , mannheim police have started to drive away homeless people hanging around the central marketplace . but for one week a year , the marketplace is littered in a very different way : people taking part in the cleaning fair drop their own trash .
tidying up their plastic plates , cutlery and cans will take half an hour , three garbage collectors and two cleaning vans - but still a good investment , officials say .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .
" this big shop over there - that used to be one of the truly sought-after locations of the city - has not seen a new tenant for more than nine months now .
if the local government does n't do something about all this garbage , there 'll soon be no one left here . " sweep for the economy but since last year , city officials have taken action - though in a rather unorthodox way .
with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .

with the coming of spring , they call on the mannheim population to clean their own streets - without pay - during one week of cleaning festivities and other celebrations . right in the front line of the clean-up campaign are the mannheim kindergartens and schools . " our pupils throw away their garbage just wherever they are , " said one teacher .
" chewing gum , paper , banana peel - and i hope that they will stop doing so when they realize how much work it is to clean it up again .
i want them to feel more responsible for their city . " to drive home the point , some teachers like mrs. schäfer , a math teacher at one of the inner-city secondary schools , have taken to bringing their classes out into the city to clean up litter-strewn areas - to much protest . willing cleaners growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city council 's one-week cleaning festival is meant to convey the message to the citizens that cleanliness is about economic prosperity and the welfare of the community by securing jobs . the message seems to be getting through .
last year , 14,000 people out of a total of 300,000 mannheim inhabitants volunteered ; this year , numbers have been even higher since the city council holds raffles for the participants which are drawn at a cleaning fair towards the end of the week . " i collected 700 empty cigarette packets this week , " said one retired man , enthusiastically .
" it 's good for keeping in shape , because you always have to bend down . " police involvement concerns human rights groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but persuading citizens to volunteer is not the only measure city government has taken .
for the last few months , the local police have been enforcing so-called litter fines : throwing away a cigarette costs 10 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- ; for a can , you have to pay as much as 25 euros . " every place where you have litter lying around , citizens do n't feel safe , " said mannheim official rolf schmidt , who 's responsible for safety in the city .
" that 's a fact proven by statistics .
and this is a big threat for our local retail industry : for if people are afraid of becoming the victim of a crime , they will never go to this particular area for shopping .
and thus we also installed cameras in our pedestrian zone to monitor public space . " however , the cameras have alarmed civil rights groups .
they fear that the mannheim " war on crud " is part of a larger strategy not only of cleaning inner cities , but also of disciplining their inhabitants .
julia , a mannheim activist , described an incident during a demonstration last year . " we wanted to distribute pamphlets , small fliers , and then police came up to us and forbade us to do so , since our fliers would only contaminate the streets , " she said .
" this violates all rights to free speech .
all this cleanliness talk is just the tip of the iceberg . " cleansing gets a new meaning for some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia said that , in the end , the public space of inner cities would look like all those privately-owned malls : perfect to do an extended shopping tour on a saturday afternoon , but cleansed of everything that does not fit into the picture .
lately , mannheim police have started to drive away homeless people hanging around the central marketplace . but for one week a year , the marketplace is littered in a very different way : people taking part in the cleaning fair drop their own trash .
tidying up their plastic plates , cutlery and cans will take half an hour , three garbage collectors and two cleaning vans - but still a good investment , officials say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.04.2005 mannheim 's own sweeping reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brushing their way to a stronger local economy convinced that litter was driving shoppers and investors away from their city , mannheim inhabitants have taken up the broom and vowed to take back the streets in a bid to kick-start their own economic recovery . for the german retail industry , spring still has not arrived .
for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.04.2005 ring-tone maestros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the repertoire is growing by leaps and bounds ring tones can be heard just about everywhere in our modern world .
while some would like them outlawed , they generate big revenues and even jobs , since someone has to write the bleeping melodies . they pop up everywhere , on the street , in the office , in the cinema , during a performance of the adagio section of your favorite chopin concerto .
to some , ring tones from mobile phones are enough to drive someone to commit murder .
but to others , like the munich-based band supersmart , they 're beautiful music . that 's because the musicians in supersmart compose only for mobile phones ; they 're the first band in germany to do so .
they create ring tones of no more then half a minute in length , which can be downloaded off the internet .
a complete album of the mini melodies can be bought for 1.99 euros -lrb- $ 2.59 -rrb- . " we 're a good combo who has fun with music and we do n't want to run after the labels , " said good cut from supersmart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the all-mighty record labels came close to spoiling the fun for supersmart , and they criticize the current state of the music industry .
most songs today are consumer products , developed and even co-written by market researchers and trend consultants .
none should be longer than three-and-a-half minutes ; the chorus should arrive within the first 45 seconds , and if it ’ s a ballad , throw some violins in there , please . the four guys from supersmart know this first hand since several of them play in other , better-known bands .
some of their contracts forbid them from participating in side projects , so in their supersmart manifestation they prefer to remain anonymous .
the band exists only in the internet and , of course , on the mobile phone .
they consider their ring-tone compositions a bit of creative freedom outside of the confines of the mainstream music industry . symphony for the cell despite the sometimes grating aspect of them , ring tones can be difficult to compose , as the commercial ring-tone providers know all too well .
hubert weid is with the cologne-based mobile entertainment factory , a company which produces ring tones for the sector 's market leader , jamba . " we generally only work with musicians who have a classical training , " he said . andreas , a music student , is the chief composer in weid 's firm .
his job is to make ring tones out of current chart hits .
it 's not as creative an endeavor as , for example , supersmart 's original work , but it 's probably just as challenging .
the difficulty lies in the fact that mobile phones can not simply play a song like a cd player . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because of the sound limitations and the reduced number of sound tracks available on a mobile phone , andreas has to essentially " compose down , " simplifying songs without losing their essence or making them unrecognizable .
it might be compared to writing a piano version of an entire symphony . most of the time , he decides on what part of the song to focus on for the ring tone , usually the chorus .
then the real work starts .
he must listen to every voice - vocal , bass , strings - extremely carefully and enter them into a computer note for note .
after about an hour and a half , the song has generally been combed through ; the ring tone is ready . laptop jamming supersmart works somewhat differently .
the members usually jam together late into the night like other bands , but instead of have guitars slung across their shoulders , they 're sitting on a couch with laptop computers on their laps . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've completed a ring tone and put it online , there 's generally more fiddling around with it , but this time by internet users . " we learn from our fans .
there 's a little community out there that is incredibly creative and really helps us out , " said good cut .
" they tell us when , say , their siemens mobile phone will allow us to push the pitch of one part a little higher . " in a few weeks , the band will release a ring-tone album , complete with videos to every track , specially filmed to be displayed on mobile phone screens .
that 's because supersmart is sure that some day , maybe soon , the mobile phone will not only have replaced the record and cd player , but the television as well . kerstin hilt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the age of cellulus interruptus for 22 percent of germans , it seems it does n't matter how hot and heavy the sex is , when the mobile phone rings , they 're answering it - even in the middle of the act .

for four years in a row , industry representatives say , sales have been declining by an average of 1.5 percent each year , which has had a tough impact on employment .
and shops in inner cities were especially affected last year , when 30,000 people in the retail sector lost their jobs . a recent survey forecast pessimistic futures for inner-city businesses , while figures are best for shopping malls out on the urban periphery . in mannheim , a city of 300,000 inhabitants in germany 's south-west , shop owners say it 's the poor condition of the urban space - the litter and the run-down streets - that makes customers stay away .
now , mannheim city officials have come up with a new idea to prevent inner cities from turning into shabby slums . every morning at 7 a.m. , dario fontanella 's workday starts with the same ritual .
although dressed in a neat suit with a stylish red-dotted tie , he - the boss himself - grabs a broom and sweeps the pavement around his italian ice cream parlor in the local pedestrian zone . " in the 1960s , german streets used to be so tidy and well-kept that you could have eaten off the sidewalk , while in italy , my home , everything was much grubbier , " fontanella said .
" now it 's almost the other way round .
if i did n't do the cleaning every day , our tables out on the sidewalk would soon drown in mud . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dario fontanella has been running his cafe for 37 years .
over the past few years , he has become more and more alarmed as the inner-city shopping district chokes on its own garbage .
dustbins overflow with empty cans , bottles and hamburger wrappings ; the crevices of the historic cobblestone streets are filled with cigarette butts . and since public budgets are strained , there are not enough city garbage collectors to cope with all the dust .
the consequence is that ever more consumers have started fleeing from the inner-city pedestrian zone , according to concerned shopkeepers , a number of whom are also considering moving out . " you just need to take a proper look around and you 'll see how many shop windows are empty , " said one pharmacist on the central market square .

thousands of young people marched through the streets of yerevan on saturday night .
they sang the national anthem as the torchlit procession moved slowly up the hill towards a memorial to the victims .
many said they were going to spend the night at the memorial and then join a procession on sunday .
hundreds of thousands are expected to join the remembrance march .
among them will be many armenians from the united states and europe , members of the country 's huge diaspora which is at least three times as big as armenia 's current population of three million .
turkey 's position many people said they hoped to see a million and a half armenians come out into the streets on sunday - as many as are believed to have died during the two-year period of killings and deportations by ottoman turkey that began in 1915 .
ninety years later , armenia is still haunted by this past .
its borders with turkey are sealed and there are no diplomatic relations between the two countries .
the people of armenia want turkey and the world to recognise what happened in 1915 was genocide .
but ankara says the number of those killed is grossly inflated and that armenians were casualties of wwi and not victims of genocide .

that will be rectified in a forthcoming episode entitled simply dalek , in which the time lord finds that one of the metal killing machines has been collected by an unsuspecting billionaire .
voted the most evil doctor who villains of all time , the daleks and their desire to " exterminate ! " seem an integral part of the sci-fi series .
but their return was almost ruled out completely by a lengthy dispute between the bbc and the estate of late dalek creator terry nation .
after the estate accused the corporation of trying to " ruin the brand of the daleks " by wrestling control of their image , the dispute was resolved last august .
we have taken all the perceived weaknesses of the dalek and made them deadly mike tucker , miniature effects supervisor as episode director joe ahearne explained , the dalek confronted by the doctor and rose -lrb- billie piper -rrb- is a monster for a new generation .
" the daleks of the 1960s and 1970s would not make the grade today , " he says .
" they would be seen as comical rather than frightening .
we could n't have that . "
stairs have not been a problem for daleks since 1988 , when they first levitated towards sylvester mccoy in remembrance of the daleks .
the new dalek can also spin its torso independently of his head , so creeping up from behind is no longer an option .
its trademark " sink plunger " attachment also reveals a terrifying new function .
adam -lrb- played by bruno langley , right -rrb- and rose examine the dalek " we have taken all the perceived weaknesses of the dalek and made them deadly , " says mike tucker , the bbc model unit 's miniature effects supervisor .
while tucker operated the dalek 's head by remote control , nicholas briggs provided its chilling metallic voice and barnaby edwards sat inside its shell .
" you would be amazed at the number of people who wanted to get inside the dalek , " says edwards , who also operated a dalek in 1993 bbc documentary 30 years in the tardis .
" sit on a swivel chair , put a dustbin on your head and you 've got the same effect . "
moving a dalek is like trying to operate a fully-laden shopping trolley from the inside barnaby edwards , dalek operator the new dalek is brought to life by a combination of physical models and computer-generated effects , with most of its movement made by remote control - to edwards ' relief .
" moving a dalek is like trying to operate a fully-laden shopping trolley from the inside , " he says .
edwards spent stints of up to four hours inside the dalek body , watching the rest of the cast through an envelope-shaped gap .
" i was inside the dalek for as many shots as possible , so chris had someone to play off rather than just talking to an empty shell , " he said .
nick briggs created the dalek voice by speaking into an effects box the dalek 's voice , originally created by the defunct bbc radiophonic workshop , is now made by briggs alone as he talks into a box device called a ring modulator .
" roughly a third of the lines in the episode are either spoken by the dalek or rose , " says briggs .
" it never shuts up ! "
usually presented as part of a legion , the dalek appears alone in the episode which enables it to interact more extensively with the other characters .
" a dustbin in itself is not scary , it 's the performance behind it , " adds briggs .
" in rehearsals we found ourselves talking about the dalek 's motivation ! "
former coronation street star bruno langley appears in the episode as adam , who helps the doctor and his companion deal with the revitalised dalek .
" it was great to appear in such an important episode , " he says .
" my character gets on very well with rose , which of course makes the doctor jealous . "
cast and crew would not say when the daleks would next appear the 22-year-old says he can now understand why actor ewan mcgregor found it difficult to act alone on the star wars movie sets , where characters were added by computer afterwards .
" it made it much easier for us to have the dalek physically there in front of us , " langley says .
" but there were a lot of shots which had to be re-done because the dalek got stuck in a doorway . "
the cast and crew remained tight-lipped about how soon the daleks would return to further terrorise the doctor .
tucker would only say ominously : " you will never get rid of the daleks . "
doctor who : dalek is on bbc one on saturday 30 april at 1900 bst .

moving a dalek is like trying to operate a fully-laden shopping trolley from the inside barnaby edwards , dalek operator the new dalek is brought to life by a combination of physical models and computer-generated effects , with most of its movement made by remote control - to edwards ' relief .
" moving a dalek is like trying to operate a fully-laden shopping trolley from the inside , " he says .
edwards spent stints of up to four hours inside the dalek body , watching the rest of the cast through an envelope-shaped gap .
" i was inside the dalek for as many shots as possible , so chris had someone to play off rather than just talking to an empty shell , " he said .
nick briggs created the dalek voice by speaking into an effects box the dalek 's voice , originally created by the defunct bbc radiophonic workshop , is now made by briggs alone as he talks into a box device called a ring modulator .
" roughly a third of the lines in the episode are either spoken by the dalek or rose , " says briggs .
" it never shuts up ! "
usually presented as part of a legion , the dalek appears alone in the episode which enables it to interact more extensively with the other characters .
" a dustbin in itself is not scary , it 's the performance behind it , " adds briggs .
" in rehearsals we found ourselves talking about the dalek 's motivation ! "
former coronation street star bruno langley appears in the episode as adam , who helps the doctor and his companion deal with the revitalised dalek .
" it was great to appear in such an important episode , " he says .
" my character gets on very well with rose , which of course makes the doctor jealous . "
cast and crew would not say when the daleks would next appear the 22-year-old says he can now understand why actor ewan mcgregor found it difficult to act alone on the star wars movie sets , where characters were added by computer afterwards .
" it made it much easier for us to have the dalek physically there in front of us , " langley says .
" but there were a lot of shots which had to be re-done because the dalek got stuck in a doorway . "
the cast and crew remained tight-lipped about how soon the daleks would return to further terrorise the doctor .
tucker would only say ominously : " you will never get rid of the daleks . "
doctor who : dalek is on bbc one on saturday 30 april at 1900 bst .

here is a selection of their comments .
click here to read comments from the south asian region click here to read views from the americas click here to read views from europe click here to read views from the asia-pacific region click here to read views from middle east the following comments reflect the balance of views received : at a time when the world is drifting deeper into the depths of sin and moral decadence , god sent another firm hand to work in his vineyard .
a better choice could not have emerged .
ezimare ezimokhai , benin-city , nigeria where the pope comes from does not matter .
his colour is unimportant .
what counts is how he has led souls to god , brought peace to the world , united nations , and stood as a constant beacon for justice , love , truth and equality .
udechukwu bedemoore , ifitedunu , nigeria thank god the new pope has been elected .
i believe it was god who called him to be successor to pope john paul ii .
welcome our new pope benedict xvi .
aririerisim kingsley , lagos , nigeria times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too christine , oyugis , kenya i am not a catholic but i am saddened by the stand the catholic church has in its dealing with hiv prevention .
i understand why pope john paul ii stressed on abstinence , he assumed the papacy in 1978 when hiv was unheard of and it made sense that permitting condom use would lead to moral decay in the church .
however , times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too .
i am african , born and bred in africa and it is a fact that many african catholics in sub-saharan africa simply do n't use condoms because the pope said no .
christine , oyugis , kenya great !
i thank god that the papacy position has shifted out of italy once again .
though it would have been more interesting seeing cardinal arinze emerging as the new pope .
awazie sab emmanuel , port harcourt nigeria the world made their predictions , but the church prayed and god had made his final choice .
personally i am happy that pope benedict xvi is someone that is determined to maintain the teachings of the church without allowing the influences of the world .
god bless the pope .
christopher agoha , abuja , nigeria at last the church has a successor to pope john paul ii who now rests in the lord after many fruitful years .
holy father pope benedict xvi , i wish you god 's guidance and protection and many more years of success in your papacy .
nyuysuvidzem eugine yuver , limbe , cameroon the world expected the new to come from the developing world , so what impact will this have ?
is it fair that cardinals want european popes ?
i strongly think that the church in parts of the world will not welcome this .
moses limuwa , lilongwe , malawi having another european pope has nothing to do with poverty anywhere in the word michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe praise the lord .
having another european pope has nothing to do with poverty anywhere in the word .
people should understand this is different from a political position .
god bless him and his leadership .
we pray for you pope benedict xvi michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe while so many people would be disappointed with the choice of a known conservative catholic , let us not loose sight of the workings of the holy spirit and appreciate the fact that the lord always has a teaching for his people with the advent of every leadership .
god bless and keep benedict xvi .
uzoma alec , lagos , nigeria i think the princes of the rc church have chosen well - their dean - to try and fill the shoes of the great john paul ii pius , zanzibar , tanzania i am totally disappointed by the speedy selection of the pope .
a 78-year-old pontiff with conservative views wo n't reconcile the lost generation to the church especially at this end time .
the papacy is being highly politicised .
diala , lagos , nigeria i was expecting an african pope not a european pope , but since is the church 's choice i have no doubt about his work as the pope of my days .
okoso prosper kenneth k , ghana benedict xvi is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition paul ilado , nairobi , kenya although i had hoped for an african pope , benedict xvi , is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition .
paul ilado , nairobi , kenya god bless the pontificate of pope benedict xvi .
i hope it will help the catholic church grow , and i sincerely hope it will help the church move into the 21st century .
i hope he can touch just as many hearts as pope john paul ii .
chris , nairobi , kenya i am totally disappointed in the way this thing was hurriedly done .
in fact , i expected a young pontiff probably from africa , to give this poor continent a feeling of belonging .
i knew that it is a spiritual issue , but i am afraid that the world could wake up one day and hear that the new pontiff is seriously ill .
we need young leader , not this old man .
julius njikonye , abidjan , cote d 'ivoire i am happy with the choice of ratzinger as the new pope .
traditional catholicism should be respected and not tampered with .
i think they should only compromise on one thing - contraception .
with the spread of stds and to combat overpopulation , the vatican should review its stance .
carl , johannesburg it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected , as there has been a rapid growth in catholics in africa .
i think the new pope will have a tough time living up to the late pope john paul ii .
nevertheless , i wish to congratulate pope benedict xvi and pray that god will be with him as he carries out his papal duties .
janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is very difficult to fault the selection of pope benedict xvi ; he conducted the funeral of john paul with much candour and grace and it was almost obvious that he was the pope to come .
i pray the world will know greater glory in his reign as pope .
gbenga ibileye , senegal the church needs a lot of discipline and the enforcer is needed at this crucial time .
this defies all suggestions that the pope should come from a particular part of the world that is notorious for wrong-doings .
siegfried gbadago , kumasi , ghana god bless our pope , may he lead your church as st peter did .
sylvester r , kampala , uganda homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana those who though that gay bishops would be ordained and gay marriages approved will be disappointed .
homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa .
bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana the church needed somebody like him to continue what the late pope had began .
the church is in good hands now .
evans , nairobi , kenya christianity is not politics .
the word of the lord is final .
oni oladipupo , lagos , nigeria choosing joseph ratzinger is god 's wish .
when god says yes nobody can say no .
echeruo ifeanyi , imo state , nigeria congratulations pope benedict xvi .
africans , nigerians in particular , are disappointed with this outcome .
however , the ways of man are not the ways of the holy spirit .
martins nnoduo , lagos , nigeria again , blacks have been schemed out .
the catholic church has lost an opportunity to show the world that it is not a racist organisation .
nwachukwu , lagos , nigeria who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa this is the beginning of the end for the church 's attempts to rid itself of eurocentric fundamentalism and embrace the dynamic and progressive world in which its adherents live .
african catholics will continue to die from aids without the church taking a progressive stance on condoms .
and given the off-the-hip remarks , ratzinger has been making very recently , obviously the bulk of the church 's present leadership is not serious about image and the growth of the church .
who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa hardliner ?
he simply is one who seeks to follow the clear words of our lord .
michael adande , port harcourt , nigeria the smooth and peaceful process leading to the emergence of a new pope is a clear message that leadership changes can be devoid of rancour , violence and deadly manoeuvres witnessed in many countries today .
kayode owojori , ibadan , nigeria i am disappointed with this election because it shows the church is not yet to stretch beyond the horizon of john paul ii .
i will be surprised if pope benedict xvi can reach us africans as john paul ii did .
chigbu uchendu , uturu , nigeria wish him the best , if he gets on with global issues , trade injustice , human rights , governance and other issues that matter .
perhaps less on what people should do with their personal lives .
george ochieng , kandaria , kenya thank god the church is back to life alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank god the church is back to life .
i am happy we have a non-italian pope again but would have been happy if he were from latin america because that is where the roman catholic faith will strive on .
well i hope he brings europe back to the church .
alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank you lord , for giving us this simple man who will uphold the basic principles of the catholic church .
arthur , cameroon glory be to god that we now have a new pope .
let him emulate the works of john paul ii and let him work for the peace of mankind and peace on earth .
orji gerald afam , lagos nigeria i do n't know what to say as i ca n't tell if they have made the right choice by choosing joseph ratzinger .
i 'm very surprised that the election was that fast .
anyway , it is my prayer that the new pope will do more than the late pope john paulin helping humanity and listening to the voice of the masses .
i 'm not the a catholic but let me say " welcome pope benedict xvi " .
naa adei dsane , accra ghana may the spirit that led the late jp ii be with him .
obeng amoako , accra , ghana god knows why this man was chosen - there is a task to accomplish john j weah jr , monrovia , liberia god knows why this man was chosen - there is a task to accomplish .
may the lord guide and fill him with the holy spirit to enable pope benedict xvi " tend his flock " .
may the blessed virgin mary be his guidance .
john j weah jr , monrovia , liberia good luck , pope benedict xvi .
the task ahead is pretty impressive , it will a real challenge for him to fill john paul ii 's shoes .
may god bless him .
alain nkurunziza , bujumbura , burundi i 'm not catholic , but i believe that this is a very big mistake .
it did n't take long for them to decide on such an important person .
what a waste of a perfectly good opportunity to bring the catholic church back to life .
i have always held this church in high esteem but it has now slipped down a few notches .
sandra , grahamstown , south africa may the blessing of god rest heavy on the new pope .
rona , johannesburg , south africa thank god we have a father now !
ekari mkhupela , blantyre malawi i am not a catholic however but i think the cardinals have missed the point this time around .
they needed a more dynamic pope for the this century .

we pray for you pope benedict xvi michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe while so many people would be disappointed with the choice of a known conservative catholic , let us not loose sight of the workings of the holy spirit and appreciate the fact that the lord always has a teaching for his people with the advent of every leadership .
god bless and keep benedict xvi .
uzoma alec , lagos , nigeria i think the princes of the rc church have chosen well - their dean - to try and fill the shoes of the great john paul ii pius , zanzibar , tanzania i am totally disappointed by the speedy selection of the pope .
a 78-year-old pontiff with conservative views wo n't reconcile the lost generation to the church especially at this end time .
the papacy is being highly politicised .
diala , lagos , nigeria i was expecting an african pope not a european pope , but since is the church 's choice i have no doubt about his work as the pope of my days .
okoso prosper kenneth k , ghana benedict xvi is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition paul ilado , nairobi , kenya although i had hoped for an african pope , benedict xvi , is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition .
paul ilado , nairobi , kenya god bless the pontificate of pope benedict xvi .
i hope it will help the catholic church grow , and i sincerely hope it will help the church move into the 21st century .
i hope he can touch just as many hearts as pope john paul ii .
chris , nairobi , kenya i am totally disappointed in the way this thing was hurriedly done .
in fact , i expected a young pontiff probably from africa , to give this poor continent a feeling of belonging .
i knew that it is a spiritual issue , but i am afraid that the world could wake up one day and hear that the new pontiff is seriously ill .
we need young leader , not this old man .
julius njikonye , abidjan , cote d 'ivoire i am happy with the choice of ratzinger as the new pope .
traditional catholicism should be respected and not tampered with .
i think they should only compromise on one thing - contraception .
with the spread of stds and to combat overpopulation , the vatican should review its stance .
carl , johannesburg it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected , as there has been a rapid growth in catholics in africa .
i think the new pope will have a tough time living up to the late pope john paul ii .
nevertheless , i wish to congratulate pope benedict xvi and pray that god will be with him as he carries out his papal duties .
janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is very difficult to fault the selection of pope benedict xvi ; he conducted the funeral of john paul with much candour and grace and it was almost obvious that he was the pope to come .
i pray the world will know greater glory in his reign as pope .
gbenga ibileye , senegal the church needs a lot of discipline and the enforcer is needed at this crucial time .
this defies all suggestions that the pope should come from a particular part of the world that is notorious for wrong-doings .
siegfried gbadago , kumasi , ghana god bless our pope , may he lead your church as st peter did .
sylvester r , kampala , uganda homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana those who though that gay bishops would be ordained and gay marriages approved will be disappointed .
homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa .
bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana the church needed somebody like him to continue what the late pope had began .
the church is in good hands now .
evans , nairobi , kenya christianity is not politics .
the word of the lord is final .
oni oladipupo , lagos , nigeria choosing joseph ratzinger is god 's wish .
when god says yes nobody can say no .
echeruo ifeanyi , imo state , nigeria congratulations pope benedict xvi .
africans , nigerians in particular , are disappointed with this outcome .
however , the ways of man are not the ways of the holy spirit .
martins nnoduo , lagos , nigeria again , blacks have been schemed out .
the catholic church has lost an opportunity to show the world that it is not a racist organisation .
nwachukwu , lagos , nigeria who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa this is the beginning of the end for the church 's attempts to rid itself of eurocentric fundamentalism and embrace the dynamic and progressive world in which its adherents live .
african catholics will continue to die from aids without the church taking a progressive stance on condoms .
and given the off-the-hip remarks , ratzinger has been making very recently , obviously the bulk of the church 's present leadership is not serious about image and the growth of the church .
who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa hardliner ?
he simply is one who seeks to follow the clear words of our lord .
michael adande , port harcourt , nigeria the smooth and peaceful process leading to the emergence of a new pope is a clear message that leadership changes can be devoid of rancour , violence and deadly manoeuvres witnessed in many countries today .
kayode owojori , ibadan , nigeria i am disappointed with this election because it shows the church is not yet to stretch beyond the horizon of john paul ii .
i will be surprised if pope benedict xvi can reach us africans as john paul ii did .
chigbu uchendu , uturu , nigeria wish him the best , if he gets on with global issues , trade injustice , human rights , governance and other issues that matter .
perhaps less on what people should do with their personal lives .
george ochieng , kandaria , kenya thank god the church is back to life alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank god the church is back to life .
i am happy we have a non-italian pope again but would have been happy if he were from latin america because that is where the roman catholic faith will strive on .
well i hope he brings europe back to the church .
alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank you lord , for giving us this simple man who will uphold the basic principles of the catholic church .
arthur , cameroon glory be to god that we now have a new pope .
let him emulate the works of john paul ii and let him work for the peace of mankind and peace on earth .
orji gerald afam , lagos nigeria i do n't know what to say as i ca n't tell if they have made the right choice by choosing joseph ratzinger .
i 'm very surprised that the election was that fast .
anyway , it is my prayer that the new pope will do more than the late pope john paulin helping humanity and listening to the voice of the masses .
i 'm not the a catholic but let me say " welcome pope benedict xvi " .
naa adei dsane , accra ghana may the spirit that led the late jp ii be with him .
obeng amoako , accra , ghana god knows why this man was chosen - there is a task to accomplish john j weah jr , monrovia , liberia god knows why this man was chosen - there is a task to accomplish .
may the lord guide and fill him with the holy spirit to enable pope benedict xvi " tend his flock " .
may the blessed virgin mary be his guidance .
john j weah jr , monrovia , liberia good luck , pope benedict xvi .
the task ahead is pretty impressive , it will a real challenge for him to fill john paul ii 's shoes .
may god bless him .
alain nkurunziza , bujumbura , burundi i 'm not catholic , but i believe that this is a very big mistake .
it did n't take long for them to decide on such an important person .
what a waste of a perfectly good opportunity to bring the catholic church back to life .
i have always held this church in high esteem but it has now slipped down a few notches .
sandra , grahamstown , south africa may the blessing of god rest heavy on the new pope .
rona , johannesburg , south africa thank god we have a father now !
ekari mkhupela , blantyre malawi i am not a catholic however but i think the cardinals have missed the point this time around .
they needed a more dynamic pope for the this century .

a better choice could not have emerged .
ezimare ezimokhai , benin-city , nigeria where the pope comes from does not matter .

aririerisim kingsley , lagos , nigeria times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too christine , oyugis , kenya i am not a catholic but i am saddened by the stand the catholic church has in its dealing with hiv prevention .
i understand why pope john paul ii stressed on abstinence , he assumed the papacy in 1978 when hiv was unheard of and it made sense that permitting condom use would lead to moral decay in the church .
however , times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too .
i am african , born and bred in africa and it is a fact that many african catholics in sub-saharan africa simply do n't use condoms because the pope said no .
christine , oyugis , kenya great !
i thank god that the papacy position has shifted out of italy once again .
though it would have been more interesting seeing cardinal arinze emerging as the new pope .
awazie sab emmanuel , port harcourt nigeria the world made their predictions , but the church prayed and god had made his final choice .

god bless the pope .

a better choice could not have emerged .
ezimare ezimokhai , benin-city , nigeria where the pope comes from does not matter .
his colour is unimportant .
what counts is how he has led souls to god , brought peace to the world , united nations , and stood as a constant beacon for justice , love , truth and equality .
udechukwu bedemoore , ifitedunu , nigeria thank god the new pope has been elected .
i believe it was god who called him to be successor to pope john paul ii .
welcome our new pope benedict xvi .
aririerisim kingsley , lagos , nigeria times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too christine , oyugis , kenya i am not a catholic but i am saddened by the stand the catholic church has in its dealing with hiv prevention .
i understand why pope john paul ii stressed on abstinence , he assumed the papacy in 1978 when hiv was unheard of and it made sense that permitting condom use would lead to moral decay in the church .
however , times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too .
i am african , born and bred in africa and it is a fact that many african catholics in sub-saharan africa simply do n't use condoms because the pope said no .
christine , oyugis , kenya great !
i thank god that the papacy position has shifted out of italy once again .
though it would have been more interesting seeing cardinal arinze emerging as the new pope .
awazie sab emmanuel , port harcourt nigeria the world made their predictions , but the church prayed and god had made his final choice .
personally i am happy that pope benedict xvi is someone that is determined to maintain the teachings of the church without allowing the influences of the world .
god bless the pope .
christopher agoha , abuja , nigeria at last the church has a successor to pope john paul ii who now rests in the lord after many fruitful years .
holy father pope benedict xvi , i wish you god 's guidance and protection and many more years of success in your papacy .
nyuysuvidzem eugine yuver , limbe , cameroon the world expected the new to come from the developing world , so what impact will this have ?
is it fair that cardinals want european popes ?
i strongly think that the church in parts of the world will not welcome this .
moses limuwa , lilongwe , malawi having another european pope has nothing to do with poverty anywhere in the word michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe praise the lord .
having another european pope has nothing to do with poverty anywhere in the word .
people should understand this is different from a political position .
god bless him and his leadership .
we pray for you pope benedict xvi michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe while so many people would be disappointed with the choice of a known conservative catholic , let us not loose sight of the workings of the holy spirit and appreciate the fact that the lord always has a teaching for his people with the advent of every leadership .
god bless and keep benedict xvi .
uzoma alec , lagos , nigeria i think the princes of the rc church have chosen well - their dean - to try and fill the shoes of the great john paul ii pius , zanzibar , tanzania i am totally disappointed by the speedy selection of the pope .
a 78-year-old pontiff with conservative views wo n't reconcile the lost generation to the church especially at this end time .
the papacy is being highly politicised .
diala , lagos , nigeria i was expecting an african pope not a european pope , but since is the church 's choice i have no doubt about his work as the pope of my days .
okoso prosper kenneth k , ghana benedict xvi is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition paul ilado , nairobi , kenya although i had hoped for an african pope , benedict xvi , is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition .
paul ilado , nairobi , kenya god bless the pontificate of pope benedict xvi .
i hope it will help the catholic church grow , and i sincerely hope it will help the church move into the 21st century .
i hope he can touch just as many hearts as pope john paul ii .
chris , nairobi , kenya i am totally disappointed in the way this thing was hurriedly done .
in fact , i expected a young pontiff probably from africa , to give this poor continent a feeling of belonging .
i knew that it is a spiritual issue , but i am afraid that the world could wake up one day and hear that the new pontiff is seriously ill .
we need young leader , not this old man .
julius njikonye , abidjan , cote d 'ivoire i am happy with the choice of ratzinger as the new pope .
traditional catholicism should be respected and not tampered with .
i think they should only compromise on one thing - contraception .
with the spread of stds and to combat overpopulation , the vatican should review its stance .
carl , johannesburg it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected , as there has been a rapid growth in catholics in africa .
i think the new pope will have a tough time living up to the late pope john paul ii .
nevertheless , i wish to congratulate pope benedict xvi and pray that god will be with him as he carries out his papal duties .
janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is very difficult to fault the selection of pope benedict xvi ; he conducted the funeral of john paul with much candour and grace and it was almost obvious that he was the pope to come .
i pray the world will know greater glory in his reign as pope .
gbenga ibileye , senegal the church needs a lot of discipline and the enforcer is needed at this crucial time .
this defies all suggestions that the pope should come from a particular part of the world that is notorious for wrong-doings .
siegfried gbadago , kumasi , ghana god bless our pope , may he lead your church as st peter did .
sylvester r , kampala , uganda homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana those who though that gay bishops would be ordained and gay marriages approved will be disappointed .
homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa .
bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana the church needed somebody like him to continue what the late pope had began .
the church is in good hands now .
evans , nairobi , kenya christianity is not politics .
the word of the lord is final .
oni oladipupo , lagos , nigeria choosing joseph ratzinger is god 's wish .
when god says yes nobody can say no .
echeruo ifeanyi , imo state , nigeria congratulations pope benedict xvi .
africans , nigerians in particular , are disappointed with this outcome .
however , the ways of man are not the ways of the holy spirit .
martins nnoduo , lagos , nigeria again , blacks have been schemed out .
the catholic church has lost an opportunity to show the world that it is not a racist organisation .
nwachukwu , lagos , nigeria who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa this is the beginning of the end for the church 's attempts to rid itself of eurocentric fundamentalism and embrace the dynamic and progressive world in which its adherents live .
african catholics will continue to die from aids without the church taking a progressive stance on condoms .
and given the off-the-hip remarks , ratzinger has been making very recently , obviously the bulk of the church 's present leadership is not serious about image and the growth of the church .
who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa hardliner ?
he simply is one who seeks to follow the clear words of our lord .
michael adande , port harcourt , nigeria the smooth and peaceful process leading to the emergence of a new pope is a clear message that leadership changes can be devoid of rancour , violence and deadly manoeuvres witnessed in many countries today .
kayode owojori , ibadan , nigeria i am disappointed with this election because it shows the church is not yet to stretch beyond the horizon of john paul ii .
i will be surprised if pope benedict xvi can reach us africans as john paul ii did .
chigbu uchendu , uturu , nigeria wish him the best , if he gets on with global issues , trade injustice , human rights , governance and other issues that matter .
perhaps less on what people should do with their personal lives .
george ochieng , kandaria , kenya thank god the church is back to life alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank god the church is back to life .
i am happy we have a non-italian pope again but would have been happy if he were from latin america because that is where the roman catholic faith will strive on .
well i hope he brings europe back to the church .
alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank you lord , for giving us this simple man who will uphold the basic principles of the catholic church .
arthur , cameroon glory be to god that we now have a new pope .

christine , oyugis , kenya great !
i thank god that the papacy position has shifted out of italy once again .
though it would have been more interesting seeing cardinal arinze emerging as the new pope .
awazie sab emmanuel , port harcourt nigeria the world made their predictions , but the church prayed and god had made his final choice .
personally i am happy that pope benedict xvi is someone that is determined to maintain the teachings of the church without allowing the influences of the world .
god bless the pope .
christopher agoha , abuja , nigeria at last the church has a successor to pope john paul ii who now rests in the lord after many fruitful years .
holy father pope benedict xvi , i wish you god 's guidance and protection and many more years of success in your papacy .
nyuysuvidzem eugine yuver , limbe , cameroon the world expected the new to come from the developing world , so what impact will this have ?

having another european pope has nothing to do with poverty anywhere in the word .
people should understand this is different from a political position .
god bless him and his leadership .
we pray for you pope benedict xvi michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe while so many people would be disappointed with the choice of a known conservative catholic , let us not loose sight of the workings of the holy spirit and appreciate the fact that the lord always has a teaching for his people with the advent of every leadership .
god bless and keep benedict xvi .
uzoma alec , lagos , nigeria i think the princes of the rc church have chosen well - their dean - to try and fill the shoes of the great john paul ii pius , zanzibar , tanzania i am totally disappointed by the speedy selection of the pope .
a 78-year-old pontiff with conservative views wo n't reconcile the lost generation to the church especially at this end time .
the papacy is being highly politicised .
diala , lagos , nigeria i was expecting an african pope not a european pope , but since is the church 's choice i have no doubt about his work as the pope of my days .
okoso prosper kenneth k , ghana benedict xvi is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition paul ilado , nairobi , kenya although i had hoped for an african pope , benedict xvi , is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition .
paul ilado , nairobi , kenya god bless the pontificate of pope benedict xvi .
i hope it will help the catholic church grow , and i sincerely hope it will help the church move into the 21st century .
i hope he can touch just as many hearts as pope john paul ii .
chris , nairobi , kenya i am totally disappointed in the way this thing was hurriedly done .
in fact , i expected a young pontiff probably from africa , to give this poor continent a feeling of belonging .
i knew that it is a spiritual issue , but i am afraid that the world could wake up one day and hear that the new pontiff is seriously ill .
we need young leader , not this old man .
julius njikonye , abidjan , cote d 'ivoire i am happy with the choice of ratzinger as the new pope .
traditional catholicism should be respected and not tampered with .
i think they should only compromise on one thing - contraception .
with the spread of stds and to combat overpopulation , the vatican should review its stance .
carl , johannesburg it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected , as there has been a rapid growth in catholics in africa .
i think the new pope will have a tough time living up to the late pope john paul ii .
nevertheless , i wish to congratulate pope benedict xvi and pray that god will be with him as he carries out his papal duties .
janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is very difficult to fault the selection of pope benedict xvi ; he conducted the funeral of john paul with much candour and grace and it was almost obvious that he was the pope to come .
i pray the world will know greater glory in his reign as pope .
gbenga ibileye , senegal the church needs a lot of discipline and the enforcer is needed at this crucial time .
this defies all suggestions that the pope should come from a particular part of the world that is notorious for wrong-doings .
siegfried gbadago , kumasi , ghana god bless our pope , may he lead your church as st peter did .

the word of the lord is final .
oni oladipupo , lagos , nigeria choosing joseph ratzinger is god 's wish .
when god says yes nobody can say no .
echeruo ifeanyi , imo state , nigeria congratulations pope benedict xvi .
africans , nigerians in particular , are disappointed with this outcome .
however , the ways of man are not the ways of the holy spirit .
martins nnoduo , lagos , nigeria again , blacks have been schemed out .
the catholic church has lost an opportunity to show the world that it is not a racist organisation .
nwachukwu , lagos , nigeria who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa this is the beginning of the end for the church 's attempts to rid itself of eurocentric fundamentalism and embrace the dynamic and progressive world in which its adherents live .
african catholics will continue to die from aids without the church taking a progressive stance on condoms .
and given the off-the-hip remarks , ratzinger has been making very recently , obviously the bulk of the church 's present leadership is not serious about image and the growth of the church .
who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa hardliner ?
he simply is one who seeks to follow the clear words of our lord .
michael adande , port harcourt , nigeria the smooth and peaceful process leading to the emergence of a new pope is a clear message that leadership changes can be devoid of rancour , violence and deadly manoeuvres witnessed in many countries today .
kayode owojori , ibadan , nigeria i am disappointed with this election because it shows the church is not yet to stretch beyond the horizon of john paul ii .
i will be surprised if pope benedict xvi can reach us africans as john paul ii did .
chigbu uchendu , uturu , nigeria wish him the best , if he gets on with global issues , trade injustice , human rights , governance and other issues that matter .
perhaps less on what people should do with their personal lives .
george ochieng , kandaria , kenya thank god the church is back to life alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank god the church is back to life .
i am happy we have a non-italian pope again but would have been happy if he were from latin america because that is where the roman catholic faith will strive on .
well i hope he brings europe back to the church .
alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank you lord , for giving us this simple man who will uphold the basic principles of the catholic church .
arthur , cameroon glory be to god that we now have a new pope .
let him emulate the works of john paul ii and let him work for the peace of mankind and peace on earth .
orji gerald afam , lagos nigeria i do n't know what to say as i ca n't tell if they have made the right choice by choosing joseph ratzinger .
i 'm very surprised that the election was that fast .
anyway , it is my prayer that the new pope will do more than the late pope john paulin helping humanity and listening to the voice of the masses .
i 'm not the a catholic but let me say " welcome pope benedict xvi " .
naa adei dsane , accra ghana may the spirit that led the late jp ii be with him .
obeng amoako , accra , ghana god knows why this man was chosen - there is a task to accomplish john j weah jr , monrovia , liberia god knows why this man was chosen - there is a task to accomplish .
may the lord guide and fill him with the holy spirit to enable pope benedict xvi " tend his flock " .
may the blessed virgin mary be his guidance .
john j weah jr , monrovia , liberia good luck , pope benedict xvi .
the task ahead is pretty impressive , it will a real challenge for him to fill john paul ii 's shoes .
may god bless him .
alain nkurunziza , bujumbura , burundi i 'm not catholic , but i believe that this is a very big mistake .
it did n't take long for them to decide on such an important person .
what a waste of a perfectly good opportunity to bring the catholic church back to life .
i have always held this church in high esteem but it has now slipped down a few notches .
sandra , grahamstown , south africa may the blessing of god rest heavy on the new pope .
rona , johannesburg , south africa thank god we have a father now !
ekari mkhupela , blantyre malawi i am not a catholic however but i think the cardinals have missed the point this time around .
they needed a more dynamic pope for the this century .

african catholics will continue to die from aids without the church taking a progressive stance on condoms .

a better choice could not have emerged .
ezimare ezimokhai , benin-city , nigeria where the pope comes from does not matter .
his colour is unimportant .
what counts is how he has led souls to god , brought peace to the world , united nations , and stood as a constant beacon for justice , love , truth and equality .
udechukwu bedemoore , ifitedunu , nigeria thank god the new pope has been elected .
i believe it was god who called him to be successor to pope john paul ii .
welcome our new pope benedict xvi .
aririerisim kingsley , lagos , nigeria times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too christine , oyugis , kenya i am not a catholic but i am saddened by the stand the catholic church has in its dealing with hiv prevention .
i understand why pope john paul ii stressed on abstinence , he assumed the papacy in 1978 when hiv was unheard of and it made sense that permitting condom use would lead to moral decay in the church .
however , times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too .
i am african , born and bred in africa and it is a fact that many african catholics in sub-saharan africa simply do n't use condoms because the pope said no .
christine , oyugis , kenya great !
i thank god that the papacy position has shifted out of italy once again .
though it would have been more interesting seeing cardinal arinze emerging as the new pope .
awazie sab emmanuel , port harcourt nigeria the world made their predictions , but the church prayed and god had made his final choice .
personally i am happy that pope benedict xvi is someone that is determined to maintain the teachings of the church without allowing the influences of the world .
god bless the pope .
christopher agoha , abuja , nigeria at last the church has a successor to pope john paul ii who now rests in the lord after many fruitful years .
holy father pope benedict xvi , i wish you god 's guidance and protection and many more years of success in your papacy .
nyuysuvidzem eugine yuver , limbe , cameroon the world expected the new to come from the developing world , so what impact will this have ?
is it fair that cardinals want european popes ?
i strongly think that the church in parts of the world will not welcome this .
moses limuwa , lilongwe , malawi having another european pope has nothing to do with poverty anywhere in the word michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe praise the lord .
having another european pope has nothing to do with poverty anywhere in the word .
people should understand this is different from a political position .
god bless him and his leadership .
we pray for you pope benedict xvi michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe while so many people would be disappointed with the choice of a known conservative catholic , let us not loose sight of the workings of the holy spirit and appreciate the fact that the lord always has a teaching for his people with the advent of every leadership .
god bless and keep benedict xvi .
uzoma alec , lagos , nigeria i think the princes of the rc church have chosen well - their dean - to try and fill the shoes of the great john paul ii pius , zanzibar , tanzania i am totally disappointed by the speedy selection of the pope .
a 78-year-old pontiff with conservative views wo n't reconcile the lost generation to the church especially at this end time .
the papacy is being highly politicised .
diala , lagos , nigeria i was expecting an african pope not a european pope , but since is the church 's choice i have no doubt about his work as the pope of my days .
okoso prosper kenneth k , ghana benedict xvi is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition paul ilado , nairobi , kenya although i had hoped for an african pope , benedict xvi , is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition .
paul ilado , nairobi , kenya god bless the pontificate of pope benedict xvi .
i hope it will help the catholic church grow , and i sincerely hope it will help the church move into the 21st century .
i hope he can touch just as many hearts as pope john paul ii .
chris , nairobi , kenya i am totally disappointed in the way this thing was hurriedly done .
in fact , i expected a young pontiff probably from africa , to give this poor continent a feeling of belonging .
i knew that it is a spiritual issue , but i am afraid that the world could wake up one day and hear that the new pontiff is seriously ill .
we need young leader , not this old man .
julius njikonye , abidjan , cote d 'ivoire i am happy with the choice of ratzinger as the new pope .
traditional catholicism should be respected and not tampered with .
i think they should only compromise on one thing - contraception .
with the spread of stds and to combat overpopulation , the vatican should review its stance .
carl , johannesburg it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected , as there has been a rapid growth in catholics in africa .
i think the new pope will have a tough time living up to the late pope john paul ii .
nevertheless , i wish to congratulate pope benedict xvi and pray that god will be with him as he carries out his papal duties .
janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is very difficult to fault the selection of pope benedict xvi ; he conducted the funeral of john paul with much candour and grace and it was almost obvious that he was the pope to come .
i pray the world will know greater glory in his reign as pope .
gbenga ibileye , senegal the church needs a lot of discipline and the enforcer is needed at this crucial time .
this defies all suggestions that the pope should come from a particular part of the world that is notorious for wrong-doings .
siegfried gbadago , kumasi , ghana god bless our pope , may he lead your church as st peter did .
sylvester r , kampala , uganda homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana those who though that gay bishops would be ordained and gay marriages approved will be disappointed .
homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa .
bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana the church needed somebody like him to continue what the late pope had began .
the church is in good hands now .
evans , nairobi , kenya christianity is not politics .
the word of the lord is final .
oni oladipupo , lagos , nigeria choosing joseph ratzinger is god 's wish .
when god says yes nobody can say no .
echeruo ifeanyi , imo state , nigeria congratulations pope benedict xvi .
africans , nigerians in particular , are disappointed with this outcome .
however , the ways of man are not the ways of the holy spirit .
martins nnoduo , lagos , nigeria again , blacks have been schemed out .
the catholic church has lost an opportunity to show the world that it is not a racist organisation .
nwachukwu , lagos , nigeria who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa this is the beginning of the end for the church 's attempts to rid itself of eurocentric fundamentalism and embrace the dynamic and progressive world in which its adherents live .

a better choice could not have emerged .
ezimare ezimokhai , benin-city , nigeria where the pope comes from does not matter .
his colour is unimportant .
what counts is how he has led souls to god , brought peace to the world , united nations , and stood as a constant beacon for justice , love , truth and equality .
udechukwu bedemoore , ifitedunu , nigeria thank god the new pope has been elected .
i believe it was god who called him to be successor to pope john paul ii .
welcome our new pope benedict xvi .
aririerisim kingsley , lagos , nigeria " times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too " christine , oyugis , kenya i am not a catholic but i am saddened by the stand the catholic church has in its dealing with hiv prevention .
i understand why pope john paul ii stressed on abstinence , he assumed the papacy in 1978 when hiv was unheard of and it made sense that permitting condom use would lead to moral decay in the church .
however , times have changed and it 's time the catholic church changed too .
i am african , born and bred in africa and it is a fact that many african catholics in sub-saharan africa simply do n't use condoms because the pope said no .
christine , oyugis , kenya great !
i thank god that the papacy position has shifted out of italy once again .
though it would have been more interesting seeing cardinal arinze emerging as the new pope .
awazie sab emmanuel , port harcourt nigeria the world made their predictions , but the church prayed and god had made his final choice .
personally i am happy that pope benedict xvi is someone that is determined to maintain the teachings of the church without allowing the influences of the world .
god bless the pope .
christopher agoha , abuja , nigeria at last the church has a successor to pope john paul ii who now rests in the lord after many fruitful years .
holy father pope benedict xvi , i wish you god 's guidance and protection and many more years of success in your papacy .
nyuysuvidzem eugine yuver , limbe , cameroon the world expected the new to come from the developing world , so what impact will this have ?
is it fair that cardinals want european popes ?
i strongly think that the church in parts of the world will not welcome this .
moses limuwa , lilongwe , malawi " having another european pope has nothing to do with poverty anywhere in the word " michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe praise the lord .
having another european pope has nothing to do with poverty anywhere in the word .
people should understand this is different from a political position .
god bless him and his leadership .
we pray for you pope benedict xvi michael jambanja , harare , zimbabwe while so many people would be disappointed with the choice of a known conservative catholic , let us not loose sight of the workings of the holy spirit and appreciate the fact that the lord always has a teaching for his people with the advent of every leadership .
god bless and keep benedict xvi .
uzoma alec , lagos , nigeria i think the princes of the rc church have chosen well - their dean - to try and fill the shoes of the great john paul ii pius , zanzibar , tanzania i am totally disappointed by the speedy selection of the pope .
a 78-year-old pontiff with conservative views wo n't reconcile the lost generation to the church especially at this end time .
the papacy is being highly politicised .
diala , lagos , nigeria i was expecting an african pope not a european pope , but since is the church 's choice i have no doubt about his work as the pope of my days .
okoso prosper kenneth k , ghana " benedict xvi is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition " paul ilado , nairobi , kenya although i had hoped for an african pope , benedict xvi , is a good choice who 'll maintain tradition .
paul ilado , nairobi , kenya god bless the pontificate of pope benedict xvi .
i hope it will help the catholic church grow , and i sincerely hope it will help the church move into the 21st century .
i hope he can touch just as many hearts as pope john paul ii .
chris , nairobi , kenya i am totally disappointed in the way this thing was hurriedly done .
in fact , i expected a young pontiff probably from africa , to give this poor continent a feeling of belonging .
i knew that it is a spiritual issue , but i am afraid that the world could wake up one day and hear that the new pontiff is seriously ill .
we need young leader , not this old man .
julius njikonye , abidjan , cote d 'ivoire i am happy with the choice of ratzinger as the new pope .
traditional catholicism should be respected and not tampered with .
i think they should only compromise on one thing - contraception .
with the spread of stds and to combat overpopulation , the vatican should review its stance .
carl , johannesburg " it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected " janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is a disappointment that an african pope was not elected , as there has been a rapid growth in catholics in africa .
i think the new pope will have a tough time living up to the late pope john paul ii .
nevertheless , i wish to congratulate pope benedict xvi and pray that god will be with him as he carries out his papal duties .
janathan mick , blantyre , malawi it is very difficult to fault the selection of pope benedict xvi ; he conducted the funeral of john paul with much candour and grace and it was almost obvious that he was the pope to come .
i pray the world will know greater glory in his reign as pope .
gbenga ibileye , senegal the church needs a lot of discipline and the enforcer is needed at this crucial time .
this defies all suggestions that the pope should come from a particular part of the world that is notorious for wrong-doings .
siegfried gbadago , kumasi , ghana god bless our pope , may he lead your church as st peter did .
sylvester r , kampala , uganda " homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa " bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana those who though that gay bishops would be ordained and gay marriages approved will be disappointed .
homosexuals will have no place in the church , certainly not in africa .
bright oduro-nimo , accra , ghana the church needed somebody like him to continue what the late pope had began .
the church is in good hands now .
evans , nairobi , kenya christianity is not politics .
the word of the lord is final .
oni oladipupo , lagos , nigeria choosing joseph ratzinger is god 's wish .
when god says yes nobody can say no .
echeruo ifeanyi , imo state , nigeria congratulations pope benedict xvi .
africans , nigerians in particular , are disappointed with this outcome .
however , the ways of man are not the ways of the holy spirit .
martins nnoduo , lagos , nigeria again , blacks have been schemed out .
the catholic church has lost an opportunity to show the world that it is not a racist organisation .
nwachukwu , lagos , nigeria " who outside western europe can relate to this man ? "
phila , durban , south africa this is the beginning of the end for the church 's attempts to rid itself of eurocentric fundamentalism and embrace the dynamic and progressive world in which its adherents live .
african catholics will continue to die from aids without the church taking a progressive stance on condoms .
and given the off-the-hip remarks , ratzinger has been making very recently , obviously the bulk of the church 's present leadership is not serious about image and the growth of the church .
who outside western europe can relate to this man ?
phila , durban , south africa hardliner ?
he simply is one who seeks to follow the clear words of our lord .
michael adande , port harcourt , nigeria the smooth and peaceful process leading to the emergence of a new pope is a clear message that leadership changes can be devoid of rancour , violence and deadly manoeuvres witnessed in many countries today .
kayode owojori , ibadan , nigeria i am disappointed with this election because it shows the church is not yet to stretch beyond the horizon of john paul ii .
i will be surprised if pope benedict xvi can reach us africans as john paul ii did .
chigbu uchendu , uturu , nigeria wish him the best , if he gets on with global issues , trade injustice , human rights , governance and other issues that matter .
perhaps less on what people should do with their personal lives .
george ochieng , kandaria , kenya " thank god the church is back to life " alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank god the church is back to life .
i am happy we have a non-italian pope again but would have been happy if he were from latin america because that is where the roman catholic faith will strive on .
well i hope he brings europe back to the church .
alex , dakar-senegal , cameroon thank you lord , for giving us this simple man who will uphold the basic principles of the catholic church .
arthur , cameroon glory be to god that we now have a new pope .
let him emulate the works of john paul ii and let him work for the peace of mankind and peace on earth .
orji gerald afam , lagos nigeria i do n't know what to say as i ca n't tell if they have made the right choice by choosing joseph ratzinger .
i 'm very surprised that the election was that fast .
anyway , it is my prayer that the new pope will do more than the late pope john paulin helping humanity and listening to the voice of the masses .
i 'm not the a catholic but let me say " welcome pope benedict xvi " .
naa adei dsane , accra ghana may the spirit that led the late jp ii be with him .
obeng amoako , accra , ghana " god knows why this man was chosen - there is a task to accomplish " john j weah jr , monrovia , liberia god knows why this man was chosen - there is a task to accomplish .

may the blessed virgin mary be his guidance .
john j weah jr , monrovia , liberia good luck , pope benedict xvi .
the task ahead is pretty impressive , it will a real challenge for him to fill john paul ii 's shoes .
may god bless him .
alain nkurunziza , bujumbura , burundi i 'm not catholic , but i believe that this is a very big mistake .
it did n't take long for them to decide on such an important person .
what a waste of a perfectly good opportunity to bring the catholic church back to life .
i have always held this church in high esteem but it has now slipped down a few notches .
sandra , grahamstown , south africa may the blessing of god rest heavy on the new pope .
rona , johannesburg , south africa thank god we have a father now !
ekari mkhupela , blantyre malawi i am not a catholic however but i think the cardinals have missed the point this time around .
they needed a more dynamic pope for the this century .
