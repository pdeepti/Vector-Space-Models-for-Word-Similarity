the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .
this year 's crop saw michael , marta and their fellow chosen few present their end of cycle offerings at the recent san sebastian international film festival in northern spain . lear n i n g from us to compete neither reichenberg nor ravani are originally from the cinematic scene - she having studied economics and he medicine . but both rely on a confident attitude as they go all out to attract public , private and broadcast investment to finance their efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood producers are masters of marketing and distribution and both have ideas on how european cinema can learn from the us model on occasion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.11.2005 grooming the next generation of european filmmakers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can today 's european filmmakers make classics like " metropolis " ?
a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .
this year 's crop saw michael , marta and their fellow chosen few present their end of cycle offerings at the recent san sebastian international film festival in northern spain . lear n i n g from us to compete neither reichenberg nor ravani are originally from the cinematic scene - she having studied economics and he medicine . but both rely on a confident attitude as they go all out to attract public , private and broadcast investment to finance their efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood producers are masters of marketing and distribution and both have ideas on how european cinema can learn from the us model on occasion . " french cinema is sometimes very centered on the director and we want to show that producers can also come up with ideas and initiatives , " reichenberg said .
" we 're trying to transpose what works for the americans . " he agreed with ravani that europeans should focus on co-productions to compete with hollywood . " the only goal if you want to be making films in 10 years time is to find ones which are bigger than just for one country , " he said .
" it 's for the europe of tomorrow that we are producing . " dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

the president of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- thinks the tournament is two years too early . german national coach jürgen klinsmann is well-known for the optimism that he exudes in the team .
from his home in california , he brought sunshine to a team that was mired in gloom .
the response early on was positive , and the predictions , at least from klinsmann , were bold - germany will get to the finals on home soil , just like in 1974 . it was the american attitude of " nothing ventured , nothing gained " that had infected klinsmann in southern california .
it worked at the confederations cup .
they played exciting , open soccer before losing to a top-notch brazil in the semifinals but then beating mexico for third-place . since then , the squad , in some positions filled with young blood , built around star midfielder michael ballack have floundered with losses to slovakia and turkey .
the defense , clearly the weak link in the german team , was failing them conspicuously , and the strikers were n't firing on all cylinders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german eagle has shown signs of weakness of late it was reason enough to become doubtful .
the skeptics at home have begun to win the upper hand in the battle of the minds in the team and people around the country .
outgoing german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder launched the latest volley by saying the reshuffling of the team was " dangerous " before the world cup . " for this reason it would certainly be better , if the world cup started two years later , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung . friendly test against france despite the increasing doubts of a triumphant world cup for germany , mayer-vorfelder feels that the " klinsmann system " must be given more time .
the failure to cultivate young talent had been neglected in the past six years , he said , adding that " there was no way to compensate for that in six months . " once the world cup has ended , no matter how it may turn out , contract negotiations will likely be renewed with klinsmann .
mayer-vorfelder believes it would be best if the coach stayed on until 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has carried the team the most recently despite what may be happening off the field , the team - currently in 15th place - ca n't shy away from directly competing with the top countries in the world .
next saturday , it will have its hands full in paris against the world 's number five team , france . team manager oliver bierhoff also belongs to the sanguine staff around jürgen klinsmann , but even he sees the german team being in a state of disbelief about the quick fall since the confed cup in june .
he told the kieler nachrichten newspaper that " turbulence " can be unleashed at any moment . " it 's our biggest goal to stand firm in france and to play a good friendly .
but how it will turn out , nobody knows , " he told the daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry -lrb- r -rrb- should n't play in martinique says his coach from arsenal , arsene wenger one advantage that the german squad may have heading to paris is the uproar amongst many coaches of french international players against the l 'equipe tricolor 's strenuous program before the germany match .
just three days before , they are playing a charity match on martinique against costa rica .
the proceeds are to go towards martinique families who lost loved ones in a plane crash this summer . french teams , but also arsenal coach arsene wenger for whom striker thierry henry plays , have loudly criticized the french soccer federation for this decision . maybe , just maybe , jet lag will play into jürgen klinsmann 's hands . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann brings california sunshine to germany coach jürgen klinsmann has been at the helm of the german national team for five months .

but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .

but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .

but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .

the president of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- thinks the tournament is two years too early . german national coach jürgen klinsmann is well-known for the optimism that he exudes in the team .
from his home in california , he brought sunshine to a team that was mired in gloom .
the response early on was positive , and the predictions , at least from klinsmann , were bold - germany will get to the finals on home soil , just like in 1974 . it was the american attitude of " nothing ventured , nothing gained " that had infected klinsmann in southern california .
it worked at the confederations cup .
they played exciting , open soccer before losing to a top-notch brazil in the semifinals but then beating mexico for third-place . since then , the squad , in some positions filled with young blood , built around star midfielder michael ballack have floundered with losses to slovakia and turkey .
the defense , clearly the weak link in the german team , was failing them conspicuously , and the strikers were n't firing on all cylinders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german eagle has shown signs of weakness of late it was reason enough to become doubtful .
the skeptics at home have begun to win the upper hand in the battle of the minds in the team and people around the country .
outgoing german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder launched the latest volley by saying the reshuffling of the team was " dangerous " before the world cup . " for this reason it would certainly be better , if the world cup started two years later , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung . friendly test against france despite the increasing doubts of a triumphant world cup for germany , mayer-vorfelder feels that the " klinsmann system " must be given more time .
the failure to cultivate young talent had been neglected in the past six years , he said , adding that " there was no way to compensate for that in six months . " once the world cup has ended , no matter how it may turn out , contract negotiations will likely be renewed with klinsmann .
mayer-vorfelder believes it would be best if the coach stayed on until 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has carried the team the most recently despite what may be happening off the field , the team - currently in 15th place - ca n't shy away from directly competing with the top countries in the world .
next saturday , it will have its hands full in paris against the world 's number five team , france . team manager oliver bierhoff also belongs to the sanguine staff around jürgen klinsmann , but even he sees the german team being in a state of disbelief about the quick fall since the confed cup in june .
he told the kieler nachrichten newspaper that " turbulence " can be unleashed at any moment . " it 's our biggest goal to stand firm in france and to play a good friendly .
but how it will turn out , nobody knows , " he told the daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry -lrb- r -rrb- should n't play in martinique says his coach from arsenal , arsene wenger one advantage that the german squad may have heading to paris is the uproar amongst many coaches of french international players against the l 'equipe tricolor 's strenuous program before the germany match .
just three days before , they are playing a charity match on martinique against costa rica .
the proceeds are to go towards martinique families who lost loved ones in a plane crash this summer . french teams , but also arsenal coach arsene wenger for whom striker thierry henry plays , have loudly criticized the french soccer federation for this decision . maybe , just maybe , jet lag will play into jürgen klinsmann 's hands . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann brings california sunshine to germany coach jürgen klinsmann has been at the helm of the german national team for five months .
after the asian tour , it 's time to take a look at just what the former international striker has accomplished since august .

23 , 2004 -rrb- germany face world cup with optimism after crashing out of euro 2004 , germany were just glad to have qualified for the 2006 world cup as hosts but now there is a genuine belief that they can lift the trophy .
-lrb- july 7 , 2005 -rrb- rankings " a joke " as germany slip to 20th jürgen klinsmann has branded the fifa world ranking system " a bad joke " after germany slipped to 20th place .
the lack of competitive games for the world cup hosts means that germany have not won a point since euro 2004 .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.11.2005 grooming the next generation of european filmmakers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can today 's european filmmakers make classics like " metropolis " ?
a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

the president of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- thinks the tournament is two years too early . german national coach jürgen klinsmann is well-known for the optimism that he exudes in the team .
from his home in california , he brought sunshine to a team that was mired in gloom .
the response early on was positive , and the predictions , at least from klinsmann , were bold - germany will get to the finals on home soil , just like in 1974 . it was the american attitude of " nothing ventured , nothing gained " that had infected klinsmann in southern california .
it worked at the confederations cup .
they played exciting , open soccer before losing to a top-notch brazil in the semifinals but then beating mexico for third-place . since then , the squad , in some positions filled with young blood , built around star midfielder michael ballack have floundered with losses to slovakia and turkey .
the defense , clearly the weak link in the german team , was failing them conspicuously , and the strikers were n't firing on all cylinders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german eagle has shown signs of weakness of late it was reason enough to become doubtful .
the skeptics at home have begun to win the upper hand in the battle of the minds in the team and people around the country .
outgoing german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder launched the latest volley by saying the reshuffling of the team was " dangerous " before the world cup . " for this reason it would certainly be better , if the world cup started two years later , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung . friendly test against france despite the increasing doubts of a triumphant world cup for germany , mayer-vorfelder feels that the " klinsmann system " must be given more time .
the failure to cultivate young talent had been neglected in the past six years , he said , adding that " there was no way to compensate for that in six months . " once the world cup has ended , no matter how it may turn out , contract negotiations will likely be renewed with klinsmann .

" co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .
this year 's crop saw michael , marta and their fellow chosen few present their end of cycle offerings at the recent san sebastian international film festival in northern spain . lear n i n g from us to compete neither reichenberg nor ravani are originally from the cinematic scene - she having studied economics and he medicine . but both rely on a confident attitude as they go all out to attract public , private and broadcast investment to finance their efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood producers are masters of marketing and distribution and both have ideas on how european cinema can learn from the us model on occasion . " french cinema is sometimes very centered on the director and we want to show that producers can also come up with ideas and initiatives , " reichenberg said .
" we 're trying to transpose what works for the americans . " he agreed with ravani that europeans should focus on co-productions to compete with hollywood . " the only goal if you want to be making films in 10 years time is to find ones which are bigger than just for one country , " he said .
" it 's for the europe of tomorrow that we are producing .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

the president of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- thinks the tournament is two years too early . german national coach jürgen klinsmann is well-known for the optimism that he exudes in the team .
from his home in california , he brought sunshine to a team that was mired in gloom .
the response early on was positive , and the predictions , at least from klinsmann , were bold - germany will get to the finals on home soil , just like in 1974 . it was the american attitude of " nothing ventured , nothing gained " that had infected klinsmann in southern california .
it worked at the confederations cup .
they played exciting , open soccer before losing to a top-notch brazil in the semifinals but then beating mexico for third-place . since then , the squad , in some positions filled with young blood , built around star midfielder michael ballack have floundered with losses to slovakia and turkey .
the defense , clearly the weak link in the german team , was failing them conspicuously , and the strikers were n't firing on all cylinders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german eagle has shown signs of weakness of late it was reason enough to become doubtful .
the skeptics at home have begun to win the upper hand in the battle of the minds in the team and people around the country .
outgoing german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president gerhard mayer-vorfelder launched the latest volley by saying the reshuffling of the team was " dangerous " before the world cup . " for this reason it would certainly be better , if the world cup started two years later , " he told the daily stuttgarter zeitung . friendly test against france despite the increasing doubts of a triumphant world cup for germany , mayer-vorfelder feels that the " klinsmann system " must be given more time .
the failure to cultivate young talent had been neglected in the past six years , he said , adding that " there was no way to compensate for that in six months . " once the world cup has ended , no matter how it may turn out , contract negotiations will likely be renewed with klinsmann .
mayer-vorfelder believes it would be best if the coach stayed on until 2008 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has carried the team the most recently despite what may be happening off the field , the team - currently in 15th place - ca n't shy away from directly competing with the top countries in the world .
next saturday , it will have its hands full in paris against the world 's number five team , france . team manager oliver bierhoff also belongs to the sanguine staff around jürgen klinsmann , but even he sees the german team being in a state of disbelief about the quick fall since the confed cup in june .
he told the kieler nachrichten newspaper that " turbulence " can be unleashed at any moment . " it 's our biggest goal to stand firm in france and to play a good friendly .
but how it will turn out , nobody knows , " he told the daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry -lrb- r -rrb- should n't play in martinique says his coach from arsenal , arsene wenger one advantage that the german squad may have heading to paris is the uproar amongst many coaches of french international players against the l 'equipe tricolor 's strenuous program before the germany match .
just three days before , they are playing a charity match on martinique against costa rica .
the proceeds are to go towards martinique families who lost loved ones in a plane crash this summer . french teams , but also arsenal coach arsene wenger for whom striker thierry henry plays , have loudly criticized the french soccer federation for this decision . maybe , just maybe , jet lag will play into jürgen klinsmann 's hands . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann brings california sunshine to germany coach jürgen klinsmann has been at the helm of the german national team for five months .

in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

but these efforts have not even stopped the spread of the virus , let alone rolled it back . " this virus is very treacherous , " says margaret chan , the who 's point person on the h5n1 threat .
" while we can not predict when or if the h5n1 virus might spark a pandemic , we can not ignore the warning signs . " little by little , helped by infected migrating birds , the virus this year has crept out of its origins in southeast asia , heading northwards into china and into siberia , and has now touched poultry in the southeastern corner of europe .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .
this year 's crop saw michael , marta and their fellow chosen few present their end of cycle offerings at the recent san sebastian international film festival in northern spain . lear n i n g from us to compete neither reichenberg nor ravani are originally from the cinematic scene - she having studied economics and he medicine . but both rely on a confident attitude as they go all out to attract public , private and broadcast investment to finance their efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood producers are masters of marketing and distribution and both have ideas on how european cinema can learn from the us model on occasion . " french cinema is sometimes very centered on the director and we want to show that producers can also come up with ideas and initiatives , " reichenberg said .
" we 're trying to transpose what works for the americans . " he agreed with ravani that europeans should focus on co-productions to compete with hollywood . " the only goal if you want to be making films in 10 years time is to find ones which are bigger than just for one country , " he said .
" it 's for the europe of tomorrow that we are producing .

the president of the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- thinks the tournament is two years too early . german national coach jürgen klinsmann is well-known for the optimism that he exudes in the team .
from his home in california , he brought sunshine to a team that was mired in gloom .

but these efforts have not even stopped the spread of the virus , let alone rolled it back . " this virus is very treacherous , " says margaret chan , the who 's point person on the h5n1 threat .
" while we can not predict when or if the h5n1 virus might spark a pandemic , we can not ignore the warning signs . " little by little , helped by infected migrating birds , the virus this year has crept out of its origins in southeast asia , heading northwards into china and into siberia , and has now touched poultry in the southeastern corner of europe .
africa , which hosts millions of migrating birds during the northern hemisphere winter , may now be exposed . as the geographical spread widens , so does the risk that infected birds will pass on their virus to humans - and that the avian virus will mutate by mingling with the conventional flu virus . strengthening international coordination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan says improved compensation for farmers is necessary the three-day geneva conference will gather more than 400 animal and human health experts , senior policymakers , economists and industry representatives . their task is to make an up-to-date assessment of the problem , pool knowledge about national measures and strengthen international coordination against what is a global threat . priority number one is poultry , where the virus holes up . " there is still a window of opportunity for substantially reducing the risk of a human pandemic evolving from h5n1 by controlling the virus at its source , in animals , " says joseph domenech , the fao 's chief veterinary officer . the list of needs is long .
it includes better systems to monitor and report infections ; more veterinarians to diagnose outbreaks ; a swift response to contain outbreaks and cull suspected birds ; vaccination of flocks against h5n1 ; greater resolve among countries to declare outbreaks and share virus samples ; and compensating farmers whose birds are culled , to encourage honest reporting . the oie - the paramount agency for veterinary health in food trade - says an onus lies with wealthy countries to help developing nations , especially those in asia where h5n1 is now endemic . " if the international community does not help them in this way , there is every likelihood of global crises associated with emerging and re-emerging national diseases frequently occurring , " the oie warns . the fao and oie have called for 150 million dollars in contributions for this , but so far only 30 million has been forthcoming , sources at those agencies say . preparing for a pandemic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decontaminating a car in croatia : bird flu is on europe 's doorstep also pressing at the geneva conference will be how to improve preparations for a human pandemic .
the who appealed months ago for countries to draw up " action plans " for use if the feared mutated virus ever emerges . its recommendations include stockpiles of face masks , earmarking hospital beds that could be used in an emergency , protecting key personnel and deciding in advance on how to administer precious reserves of the anti-flu drug tamiflu . so far , only around 40 countries have heeded the who 's advice , and many of their plans " remain embryonic at best , " the british medical weekly the lancet observed in a commentary on saturday . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de preparing for the pandemic more and more governments are preparing for the possibility of a worldwide bird flu pandemic .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.11.2005 on tenth night , french violence worsens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters battled arsonists throughout the night arsonists torched 1,300 cars and police arrested 300 people across france overnight saturday , as the urban violence which has rocked the country for 10 nights reached a new peak . police deployed helicopters and stepped up their arrests of youths responsible for the street violence , as troubles flared for the 10th consecutive night in suburbs around paris and spread to other french cities . copycat arson attacks hit the outskirts of toulouse , bordeaux , montpellier and pau in the south , rennes and nantes in the west , lille in the north and mulhouse and colmar in the east . the disorder also spilled into central paris itself , where a petrol bomb set alight four cars near a major square , place de la republique , while half a dozen vehicles went up in smoke in the northwest 17th arrondissement , or district . despite calls for calm saturday , 1,295 cars were torched overnight compared with 897 the previous night , while arrests totalled 312 , up from 253 . seven police helicopters fitted with powerful lights and cameras flew over paris and some of the other cities in an effort to pursue and identify the youths , who have taken to setting fires then racing away , often on scooters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene of desolation in a paris suburb riot squads also broke down doors in a public housing estate in the western paris suburb of les mureaux to arrest youths who had thrown objects , such as supermarket carts , on them and on a nearby busy road . some 2,300 more police than normal were on the streets while additional firefighters were sent to the paris region . most night bus services north and east of the capital were suspended overnight saturday as a precautionary measure against ambushes which have seen at least two buses set fire to and destroyed . organized gangs interior minister nicolas sarkozy , who visited a police command headquarters at evry in southern paris overnight , has said that the gangs responsible for the violence have become increasingly organized .
they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .
could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .

his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .

but these efforts have not even stopped the spread of the virus , let alone rolled it back . " this virus is very treacherous , " says margaret chan , the who 's point person on the h5n1 threat .
" while we can not predict when or if the h5n1 virus might spark a pandemic , we can not ignore the warning signs . " little by little , helped by infected migrating birds , the virus this year has crept out of its origins in southeast asia , heading northwards into china and into siberia , and has now touched poultry in the southeastern corner of europe .
africa , which hosts millions of migrating birds during the northern hemisphere winter , may now be exposed . as the geographical spread widens , so does the risk that infected birds will pass on their virus to humans - and that the avian virus will mutate by mingling with the conventional flu virus . strengthening international coordination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan says improved compensation for farmers is necessary the three-day geneva conference will gather more than 400 animal and human health experts , senior policymakers , economists and industry representatives . their task is to make an up-to-date assessment of the problem , pool knowledge about national measures and strengthen international coordination against what is a global threat . priority number one is poultry , where the virus holes up . " there is still a window of opportunity for substantially reducing the risk of a human pandemic evolving from h5n1 by controlling the virus at its source , in animals , " says joseph domenech , the fao 's chief veterinary officer . the list of needs is long .
it includes better systems to monitor and report infections ; more veterinarians to diagnose outbreaks ; a swift response to contain outbreaks and cull suspected birds ; vaccination of flocks against h5n1 ; greater resolve among countries to declare outbreaks and share virus samples ; and compensating farmers whose birds are culled , to encourage honest reporting . the oie - the paramount agency for veterinary health in food trade - says an onus lies with wealthy countries to help developing nations , especially those in asia where h5n1 is now endemic . " if the international community does not help them in this way , there is every likelihood of global crises associated with emerging and re-emerging national diseases frequently occurring , " the oie warns . the fao and oie have called for 150 million dollars in contributions for this , but so far only 30 million has been forthcoming , sources at those agencies say . preparing for a pandemic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decontaminating a car in croatia : bird flu is on europe 's doorstep also pressing at the geneva conference will be how to improve preparations for a human pandemic .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .
this year 's crop saw michael , marta and their fellow chosen few present their end of cycle offerings at the recent san sebastian international film festival in northern spain . lear n i n g from us to compete neither reichenberg nor ravani are originally from the cinematic scene - she having studied economics and he medicine . but both rely on a confident attitude as they go all out to attract public , private and broadcast investment to finance their efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood producers are masters of marketing and distribution and both have ideas on how european cinema can learn from the us model on occasion . " french cinema is sometimes very centered on the director and we want to show that producers can also come up with ideas and initiatives , " reichenberg said .
" we 're trying to transpose what works for the americans . " he agreed with ravani that europeans should focus on co-productions to compete with hollywood . " the only goal if you want to be making films in 10 years time is to find ones which are bigger than just for one country , " he said .
" it 's for the europe of tomorrow that we are producing .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .
this year 's crop saw michael , marta and their fellow chosen few present their end of cycle offerings at the recent san sebastian international film festival in northern spain . lear n i n g from us to compete neither reichenberg nor ravani are originally from the cinematic scene - she having studied economics and he medicine . but both rely on a confident attitude as they go all out to attract public , private and broadcast investment to finance their efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood producers are masters of marketing and distribution and both have ideas on how european cinema can learn from the us model on occasion . " french cinema is sometimes very centered on the director and we want to show that producers can also come up with ideas and initiatives , " reichenberg said .
" we 're trying to transpose what works for the americans . " he agreed with ravani that europeans should focus on co-productions to compete with hollywood . " the only goal if you want to be making films in 10 years time is to find ones which are bigger than just for one country , " he said .
" it 's for the europe of tomorrow that we are producing .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .

then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .
this year 's crop saw michael , marta and their fellow chosen few present their end of cycle offerings at the recent san sebastian international film festival in northern spain . lear n i n g from us to compete neither reichenberg nor ravani are originally from the cinematic scene - she having studied economics and he medicine . but both rely on a confident attitude as they go all out to attract public , private and broadcast investment to finance their efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood producers are masters of marketing and distribution and both have ideas on how european cinema can learn from the us model on occasion . " french cinema is sometimes very centered on the director and we want to show that producers can also come up with ideas and initiatives , " reichenberg said .
" we 're trying to transpose what works for the americans . " he agreed with ravani that europeans should focus on co-productions to compete with hollywood . " the only goal if you want to be making films in 10 years time is to find ones which are bigger than just for one country , " he said .
" it 's for the europe of tomorrow that we are producing .

but these efforts have not even stopped the spread of the virus , let alone rolled it back . " this virus is very treacherous , " says margaret chan , the who 's point person on the h5n1 threat .
" while we can not predict when or if the h5n1 virus might spark a pandemic , we can not ignore the warning signs . " little by little , helped by infected migrating birds , the virus this year has crept out of its origins in southeast asia , heading northwards into china and into siberia , and has now touched poultry in the southeastern corner of europe .
africa , which hosts millions of migrating birds during the northern hemisphere winter , may now be exposed . as the geographical spread widens , so does the risk that infected birds will pass on their virus to humans - and that the avian virus will mutate by mingling with the conventional flu virus . strengthening international coordination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general kofi annan says improved compensation for farmers is necessary the three-day geneva conference will gather more than 400 animal and human health experts , senior policymakers , economists and industry representatives . their task is to make an up-to-date assessment of the problem , pool knowledge about national measures and strengthen international coordination against what is a global threat . priority number one is poultry , where the virus holes up . " there is still a window of opportunity for substantially reducing the risk of a human pandemic evolving from h5n1 by controlling the virus at its source , in animals , " says joseph domenech , the fao 's chief veterinary officer . the list of needs is long .
it includes better systems to monitor and report infections ; more veterinarians to diagnose outbreaks ; a swift response to contain outbreaks and cull suspected birds ; vaccination of flocks against h5n1 ; greater resolve among countries to declare outbreaks and share virus samples ; and compensating farmers whose birds are culled , to encourage honest reporting . the oie - the paramount agency for veterinary health in food trade - says an onus lies with wealthy countries to help developing nations , especially those in asia where h5n1 is now endemic . " if the international community does not help them in this way , there is every likelihood of global crises associated with emerging and re-emerging national diseases frequently occurring , " the oie warns . the fao and oie have called for 150 million dollars in contributions for this , but so far only 30 million has been forthcoming , sources at those agencies say . preparing for a pandemic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decontaminating a car in croatia : bird flu is on europe 's doorstep also pressing at the geneva conference will be how to improve preparations for a human pandemic .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .
this year 's crop saw michael , marta and their fellow chosen few present their end of cycle offerings at the recent san sebastian international film festival in northern spain . lear n i n g from us to compete neither reichenberg nor ravani are originally from the cinematic scene - she having studied economics and he medicine . but both rely on a confident attitude as they go all out to attract public , private and broadcast investment to finance their efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood producers are masters of marketing and distribution and both have ideas on how european cinema can learn from the us model on occasion . " french cinema is sometimes very centered on the director and we want to show that producers can also come up with ideas and initiatives , " reichenberg said .
" we 're trying to transpose what works for the americans . " he agreed with ravani that europeans should focus on co-productions to compete with hollywood . " the only goal if you want to be making films in 10 years time is to find ones which are bigger than just for one country , " he said .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .
this year 's crop saw michael , marta and their fellow chosen few present their end of cycle offerings at the recent san sebastian international film festival in northern spain . lear n i n g from us to compete neither reichenberg nor ravani are originally from the cinematic scene - she having studied economics and he medicine . but both rely on a confident attitude as they go all out to attract public , private and broadcast investment to finance their efforts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood producers are masters of marketing and distribution and both have ideas on how european cinema can learn from the us model on occasion . " french cinema is sometimes very centered on the director and we want to show that producers can also come up with ideas and initiatives , " reichenberg said .
" we 're trying to transpose what works for the americans . " he agreed with ravani that europeans should focus on co-productions to compete with hollywood . " the only goal if you want to be making films in 10 years time is to find ones which are bigger than just for one country , " he said .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

they have been seen using mobile telephones to relay police movements and internet blogs to urge unrest elsewhere . teenagers arrested in nearby courcouronnes - where police found a stockpile of crowbars , petrol bombs and iron bars - were sheepish when approached by the minister , who has come under fire for his handling of the crisis . " you 're not very happy that your dad is coming to get you , are you ? "
sarkozy asked one boy who shook his head but said his father knew he had been out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy just before the riots erupted , sarkozy had described delinquents in the suburbs " rabble " and vowed to clean up crime in the neighborhoods " with a power-hose " - comments that have angered people living in those areas . around 800 people have been arrested since the riots began , some of them minors .
in all , more than 2,700 automobiles have gone up in flames . the violence was sparked on october 27 when two teenagers , one of african and the other of arab origin , were electrocuted while hiding in an electrical sub-station after fleeing a police identity check . so far no one has been killed in the ensuing unrest , although at least two people have been badly burnt by molotov cocktails : a fireman , and a handicapped woman unable to get off an ambushed bus . a 61-year-old was also in a coma after being hit by an assailant in a public housing estate . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .

a european filmmaking masterclass is steadily producing a new generation of producers who , it is hoped , will in years to come go head-to-head with the mighty hollywood machine . the european filmmaking industry knows it has its work cut out to keep pace with the us market , with european films struggling to reach last year 's top 20 box office hits , efforts such as " bridget jones : the edge of reason " and " the chorus " being notable exceptions . christophe barratier 's " the chorus " was a relatively rare example with its french-swiss-german background of a successful quasi pan-european production and the european industry is bent on fostering greater professionalism and also greater cooperation across european states , in the us mould . " co-production is the future of european cinema , " says marta ravani , a 27-year-old italian from the masterclass workshop , a public program which trains up 18 budding european filmmakers each year . " co-production not just between two but at least three countries , " added michael reichenberg , 31 , an austrian classmate who shares ravani 's skills in german , french , english and italian . germa n -fre n ch co-operatio n the young producers are benefiting from the workshop to pursue a vocation to which both came relatively late as they pursue a year 's training funded by french cinema production unit la femis and germany 's filmakademie of baden-württemberg under the aegis of the eu 's media program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teaching young directors to hone their craft the workshop has been operating for nearly four years and seeks to produce an elite of european producers able to work as a network and plug into their contacts in their respective countries over the years ahead . six germans , six french and six other candidates from across the eu are selected for the program .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .

the seventh person connected to the discovery of a prehistoric man found in the alps has died , adding to the legend of a curse behind the ancient warrior . that a 63-year-old man should die of natural causes would normally raise few eyebrows .
but when that man was a scientist connected to the discovery of a 5,300-year-old frozen corpse known as oetzi the iceman - and the seventh such person to die within a year - talk about a curse is inevitable . us-born molecular archaeologist tom loy was found dead in his brisbane home two weeks ago as he was finalizing a book about oetzi , according to the australian newspaper . the director of the university of queensland 's archaeological sciences laboratories had suffered from a blood-related condition for about 12 years , members of his family told the paper .
the condition was diagnosed shortly after he became involved with the iceman . loy " did n't believe in the curse , " a colleague told the australian .
" it was just superstition .
people die . " stone age warrior oetzi was discovered high in the italian alps near the austrian border in 1991 , and reports and pictures of the perfectly preserved stone age warrior sparked worldwide interest .
but so did the murmurings about a curse , built around the theory that the iceman was angry at being disturbed after 53 centuries . the rumor of the curse began a year ago when the german tourist who discovered the mummy , helmut simon , 67 , fell to his death during a freak blizzard while hiking near the same spot where he saw oetzi through the ice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a curse such as those thought to surround the tombs of ancient egypt ?
within an hour of simon 's funeral , the head of the mountain rescue team that was assigned to find him , dieter warnecke , 45 , died of a heart attack .
then in april , archaeologist konrad spindler , 55 , who first inspected the prehistoric corpse , died of complications from multiple sclerosis .
the head of the forensic team examining oetzi , rainer henn , 64 , died in a car crash on the way to give a lecture about the iceman .
the mountaineer who led henn to the iceman 's body , kurt fritz , 52 , died in an avalanche , the only one of his party to be hit .
and the man who filmed oetzi 's removal from his icy mountain grave , celebrated austrian journalist rainer hoelzl , 47 , died of a brain tumor .
he did n't die alone loy was renowned for discovering human blood on the iceman 's clothing and weapons .
his work - the subject of a national geographic documentary in 2002 - debunked the theory that oetzi , age 30-45 , died alone in the mountains after a hunting accident .
by revealing four different types of human blood on oetzi 's clothing , he surmised that the stone age man was hunting with a companion when the pair got into a territorial skirmish .
fatally wounded , oetzi appears to have leaned against his companion for support .
these days , oetzi rests in a refrigerated room at the south tyrol archaeological museum in bolzano , which attracts around 300,000 visitors a year and brings in $ 5 million -lrb- 4 million euros -rrb- in tourism . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world 's oldest art uncovered in germany archeologists working on a dig in the southern german province of swabia have unearthed what they claim to be the oldest statue in the history of art .

but a senior development figure in the republic of ireland , which has had the appeal rights for more than 40 years , is urging scotland not to follow suit .
the white paper does not include a third party appeal option this month 's edition of bbc radio scotland 's the investigation series with ken macdonald examines the scottish executive 's proposals for reforming the planning system .
it is expected that the bill will be introduced to holyrood before christmas .
there is widespread criticism of the existing planning system based on council local structure plans which are often 10 years out of date .
applications are assessed against these , frequently out of date , structure plans .
the business community sees the present system as cumbersome and too often prone to delays and challenges which push up costs .
community and environmental groups feel the odds are stacked against them .
their first opportunity to get involved in the planning process is once the application has been lodged and they feel this is too late to influence the outcome .
a lack of voting and financial powers to make any changes for ourselves mean we bear a disproportionate burden of the waste for the whole of scotland anne coleman greengairs campaigner one community which feels it has suffered the worst aspects of the planning system for decades is greengairs in lanarkshire .
whereas scotland has many breathtaking sights , greengairs is a place where often you dare not take a breath , such is the stench from all of the landfill sites .
community campaigner anne coleman said : " a lack of voting and financial powers to make any changes for ourselves mean we bear a disproportionate burden of the waste for the whole of scotland . "
the executive 's reform proposals place an emphasis on developing scotland 's economy , by creating a national planning framework .
councils ' local plans must be in line with this framework and kept up to date .
it is intended that this will lead to quicker decisions on planning applications .
another key aspect of the reforms is the encouragement of developers to consult with communities much earlier in the planning process , even before an application has been submitted .
councils will also be encouraged to involve communities more closely in planning .
overwhelming result community representatives went to holyrood recently to tell msps that being consulted by developers is all well and good , but what they really want is a right of appeal in the planning system .
it is a feature of a number of other countries such as australia , new zealand and ireland , and is known as third party right of appeal -lrb- tpra -rrb- .
the person submitting the planning application is the first party and the council is the second .
despite the overwhelming result in favour of tpra in the executive 's consultation exercise , the planning white paper does not include any right for communities , or other objectors , to appeal planning decisions .
however , the snp and greens will attempt to reintroduce a limited form of tpra into the reform bill when it goes before holyrood soon .
no tpra is good news for the business community .
iain macmillan of cbi scotland said it would be very damaging to our economy .
not everyone in dublin is happy with the irish system he said : " it 's not going to happen south of the border and there is a serious risk that companies look at the prospects for expansion and development and decide they 've had enough of scotland .
" places like leeds , bradford or birmingham are offering us good incentives to go there , let 's just go and do it . "
but groups with a lot of experience of the planning system are dismayed .
duncan maclaren , of friends of the earth scotland , said : " the great benefit of tpra is that it 's a dynamic thing .
when you give communities the chance to appeal at the end of the planning process , if things have gone badly wrong , then you create an incentive which works on both the developer and the council throughout the whole process to make sure things go right . "
ireland has had tpra for more than 40 years and is frequently referred to by campaigners in scotland who are seeking similar appeal rights .
ian lumley works for the irish equivalent of the national trust .
he said : " in ireland it 's regarded as a matter of equity .
the landowner or developer has an automatic right of appeal as they do in scotland .
so in order to introduce balance , the third party also has an appeal right . "
ireland has huge infrastructure deficits such as lack of landfill sites to handle demolition waste from redevelopment projects martin whelan irish construction industry and in his experience most of the third party appeals do come from people who have a direct interest in the proposed development .
it is also a cheaper and more effective way of resolving planning disputes without having to go to court .
tpra campaigners point to ireland again when business people here say such appeal rights would damage scotland 's economy .
look at ireland 's booming growth rate , they say .
tpra does n't appear to be holding ireland back .
but a senior figure in the redevelopment of the dublin area believes tpra is strangling the very basis on which the " celtic tiger " emerged .
martin whelan , of the construction industry federation , warns that if scotland goes down the road of introducing tpra , based on the irish experience , it will cause more difficulties than benefits .
he said : " ireland has huge infrastructure deficits such as lack of landfill sites to handle demolition waste from redevelopment projects .
" tpra has been used on every occasion to scupper attempts to introduce incineration or recycling facilities to address these problems .
" as a result ireland 's economy has to bear extra costs to export our waste which affects our competitiveness . "

the white paper does not include a third party appeal option this month 's edition of bbc radio scotland 's the investigation series with ken macdonald examines the scottish executive 's proposals for reforming the planning system .
it is expected that the bill will be introduced to holyrood before christmas .
there is widespread criticism of the existing planning system based on council local structure plans which are often 10 years out of date .
applications are assessed against these , frequently out of date , structure plans .
the business community sees the present system as cumbersome and too often prone to delays and challenges which push up costs .
community and environmental groups feel the odds are stacked against them .
their first opportunity to get involved in the planning process is once the application has been lodged and they feel this is too late to influence the outcome .
a lack of voting and financial powers to make any changes for ourselves mean we bear a disproportionate burden of the waste for the whole of scotland anne coleman greengairs campaigner one community which feels it has suffered the worst aspects of the planning system for decades is greengairs in lanarkshire .
whereas scotland has many breathtaking sights , greengairs is a place where often you dare not take a breath , such is the stench from all of the landfill sites .
community campaigner anne coleman said : " a lack of voting and financial powers to make any changes for ourselves mean we bear a disproportionate burden of the waste for the whole of scotland . "
the executive 's reform proposals place an emphasis on developing scotland 's economy , by creating a national planning framework .
councils ' local plans must be in line with this framework and kept up to date .
it is intended that this will lead to quicker decisions on planning applications .
another key aspect of the reforms is the encouragement of developers to consult with communities much earlier in the planning process , even before an application has been submitted .
councils will also be encouraged to involve communities more closely in planning .
overwhelming result community representatives went to holyrood recently to tell msps that being consulted by developers is all well and good , but what they really want is a right of appeal in the planning system .
it is a feature of a number of other countries such as australia , new zealand and ireland , and is known as third party right of appeal -lrb- tpra -rrb- .
the person submitting the planning application is the first party and the council is the second .
despite the overwhelming result in favour of tpra in the executive 's consultation exercise , the planning white paper does not include any right for communities , or other objectors , to appeal planning decisions .
however , the snp and greens will attempt to reintroduce a limited form of tpra into the reform bill when it goes before holyrood soon .
no tpra is good news for the business community .
iain macmillan of cbi scotland said it would be very damaging to our economy .
not everyone in dublin is happy with the irish system he said : " it 's not going to happen south of the border and there is a serious risk that companies look at the prospects for expansion and development and decide they 've had enough of scotland .
" places like leeds , bradford or birmingham are offering us good incentives to go there , let 's just go and do it . "
but groups with a lot of experience of the planning system are dismayed .
duncan maclaren , of friends of the earth scotland , said : " the great benefit of tpra is that it 's a dynamic thing .
when you give communities the chance to appeal at the end of the planning process , if things have gone badly wrong , then you create an incentive which works on both the developer and the council throughout the whole process to make sure things go right . "
ireland has had tpra for more than 40 years and is frequently referred to by campaigners in scotland who are seeking similar appeal rights .
ian lumley works for the irish equivalent of the national trust .
he said : " in ireland it 's regarded as a matter of equity .
the landowner or developer has an automatic right of appeal as they do in scotland .
so in order to introduce balance , the third party also has an appeal right . "
ireland has huge infrastructure deficits such as lack of landfill sites to handle demolition waste from redevelopment projects martin whelan irish construction industry and in his experience most of the third party appeals do come from people who have a direct interest in the proposed development .
it is also a cheaper and more effective way of resolving planning disputes without having to go to court .
tpra campaigners point to ireland again when business people here say such appeal rights would damage scotland 's economy .
look at ireland 's booming growth rate , they say .
tpra does n't appear to be holding ireland back .
but a senior figure in the redevelopment of the dublin area believes tpra is strangling the very basis on which the " celtic tiger " emerged .
martin whelan , of the construction industry federation , warns that if scotland goes down the road of introducing tpra , based on the irish experience , it will cause more difficulties than benefits .
he said : " ireland has huge infrastructure deficits such as lack of landfill sites to handle demolition waste from redevelopment projects .
" tpra has been used on every occasion to scupper attempts to introduce incineration or recycling facilities to address these problems .
" as a result ireland 's economy has to bear extra costs to export our waste which affects our competitiveness . "

but a senior development figure in the republic of ireland , which has had the appeal rights for more than 40 years , is urging scotland not to follow suit .
the white paper does not include a third party appeal option this month 's edition of bbc radio scotland 's the investigation series with ken macdonald examines the scottish executive 's proposals for reforming the planning system .
it is expected that the bill will be introduced to holyrood before christmas .
there is widespread criticism of the existing planning system based on council local structure plans which are often 10 years out of date .
applications are assessed against these , frequently out of date , structure plans .
the business community sees the present system as cumbersome and too often prone to delays and challenges which push up costs .
community and environmental groups feel the odds are stacked against them .

community campaigner anne coleman said : " a lack of voting and financial powers to make any changes for ourselves mean we bear a disproportionate burden of the waste for the whole of scotland . "
the executive 's reform proposals place an emphasis on developing scotland 's economy , by creating a national planning framework .
councils ' local plans must be in line with this framework and kept up to date .
it is intended that this will lead to quicker decisions on planning applications .
another key aspect of the reforms is the encouragement of developers to consult with communities much earlier in the planning process , even before an application has been submitted .
councils will also be encouraged to involve communities more closely in planning .
overwhelming result community representatives went to holyrood recently to tell msps that being consulted by developers is all well and good , but what they really want is a right of appeal in the planning system .
it is a feature of a number of other countries such as australia , new zealand and ireland , and is known as third party right of appeal -lrb- tpra -rrb- .
the person submitting the planning application is the first party and the council is the second .
despite the overwhelming result in favour of tpra in the executive 's consultation exercise , the planning white paper does not include any right for communities , or other objectors , to appeal planning decisions .
however , the snp and greens will attempt to reintroduce a limited form of tpra into the reform bill when it goes before holyrood soon .
no tpra is good news for the business community .
iain macmillan of cbi scotland said it would be very damaging to our economy .
not everyone in dublin is happy with the irish system he said : " it 's not going to happen south of the border and there is a serious risk that companies look at the prospects for expansion and development and decide they 've had enough of scotland .
" places like leeds , bradford or birmingham are offering us good incentives to go there , let 's just go and do it . "
but groups with a lot of experience of the planning system are dismayed .
duncan maclaren , of friends of the earth scotland , said : " the great benefit of tpra is that it 's a dynamic thing .
when you give communities the chance to appeal at the end of the planning process , if things have gone badly wrong , then you create an incentive which works on both the developer and the council throughout the whole process to make sure things go right . "
ireland has had tpra for more than 40 years and is frequently referred to by campaigners in scotland who are seeking similar appeal rights .
ian lumley works for the irish equivalent of the national trust .
he said : " in ireland it 's regarded as a matter of equity .
the landowner or developer has an automatic right of appeal as they do in scotland .
so in order to introduce balance , the third party also has an appeal right . "
ireland has huge infrastructure deficits such as lack of landfill sites to handle demolition waste from redevelopment projects martin whelan irish construction industry and in his experience most of the third party appeals do come from people who have a direct interest in the proposed development .
it is also a cheaper and more effective way of resolving planning disputes without having to go to court .

open source programmers from around the world met in amsterdam the dutch are pretty open about the sort of stuff that many of us prefer to keep to ourselves - what goes on beneath the sheets , for example .
perhaps that is why amsterdam was chosen for a recent international get together of the open source movement .
the movement believes strongly that rather than being a trade secret , the source code of the software should be open for anyone to play with .
the result is software like the linux operating system , created through collaboration that can involve thousands of programmers .
" early on , when software was developed by computer scientists , just people working with computers , people passed around software because that was how you got computers to do things , " explained tim o 'reilly , the founder and ceo of computer information and publishing company o 'reilly media .
" what we take as the shape of the software industry today , where software is shrink-wrapped and sold , is really a 20-year anomaly that started in the 1980s .
" now we have companies like microsoft as the avatars of that movement .
but by the mid-80s there were already people saying ' we do n't like this ' . "
and what they did not like was the idea of closing off information , especially information that others could build on .
rich pickings the open source movement does not object to making money .
in fact , many of these programmers can afford to be choosy about how they earn .
we now have a world that has distribution costs of zero .
we have just built a world-wide copying machine called the internet karl fogel , collabnet the source code may be free , but there is gold in software support , training and publishing .
damian conway , who trains programmers through his business thoughtstream , said : " i think the most successful of those is definitely licensing support ; providing the software and then saying : ' if you want to buy a support contract , here 's what it will cost you on an ongoing basis ' .
" that way people are getting something that they can work with free if they want to , but when they get into trouble they have backup and you make some money out of it . "
with businesses keen on open source software and the support it offers , geek chic is smartening up .
and the software , as well , is now designed by , but not necessarily for , programmers .
open source might be more user friendly , but can it really go toe-to-toe with the giants in the market place ?
supporters of open source say it brings innovations to the market open source has been criticised for devoting so much energy to coming up with open source alternatives to what is already commercially available .
voluntary collaboration , or so the argument goes , is good for worthy imitation , but it takes money , and lots of it , to truly innovate .
but ibm 's chet kapoor believes only some of that is true .
" if you look at the open source , open community aspects of open source , they are definitely bringing innovations to the market , solving problems that are not being solved by standardised software , " he said .
" these are programmers building great technology to help their peers to build software to solve customer problems . "
business asset one very recent open source innovation is flock , a browser that integrates next-generation web technologies such as rss , blogs , bookmarks and photo sharing .
in fact the fortunes of open source are closely tied to the internet , as well as the fact that copyright and intellectual property are looking difficult to guarantee .
open source , then , might be a model to flock around .
karl fogel , from software distributor collabnet , said : " we now have a world that has distribution costs of zero .
we have just built a world-wide copying machine called the internet .
" people who learn to use that copying machine for what it is are suddenly discovering that they can have a great deal of success in traditional business economic terms .
" freedom is a business asset , under certain circumstances . "
if open source really can make money for free , then it might make sense after all to harness the wisdom of the group .

open source programmers from around the world met in amsterdam the dutch are pretty open about the sort of stuff that many of us prefer to keep to ourselves - what goes on beneath the sheets , for example .
perhaps that is why amsterdam was chosen for a recent international get together of the open source movement .
the movement believes strongly that rather than being a trade secret , the source code of the software should be open for anyone to play with .
the result is software like the linux operating system , created through collaboration that can involve thousands of programmers .
" early on , when software was developed by computer scientists , just people working with computers , people passed around software because that was how you got computers to do things , " explained tim o 'reilly , the founder and ceo of computer information and publishing company o 'reilly media .
" what we take as the shape of the software industry today , where software is shrink-wrapped and sold , is really a 20-year anomaly that started in the 1980s .
" now we have companies like microsoft as the avatars of that movement .

damian conway , who trains programmers through his business thoughtstream , said : " i think the most successful of those is definitely licensing support ; providing the software and then saying : ' if you want to buy a support contract , here 's what it will cost you on an ongoing basis ' .
" that way people are getting something that they can work with free if they want to , but when they get into trouble they have backup and you make some money out of it . "
with businesses keen on open source software and the support it offers , geek chic is smartening up .
and the software , as well , is now designed by , but not necessarily for , programmers .
open source might be more user friendly , but can it really go toe-to-toe with the giants in the market place ?
supporters of open source say it brings innovations to the market open source has been criticised for devoting so much energy to coming up with open source alternatives to what is already commercially available .
voluntary collaboration , or so the argument goes , is good for worthy imitation , but it takes money , and lots of it , to truly innovate .
but ibm 's chet kapoor believes only some of that is true .
" if you look at the open source , open community aspects of open source , they are definitely bringing innovations to the market , solving problems that are not being solved by standardised software , " he said .
" these are programmers building great technology to help their peers to build software to solve customer problems . "

open source programmers from around the world met in amsterdam the dutch are pretty open about the sort of stuff that many of us prefer to keep to ourselves - what goes on beneath the sheets , for example .
perhaps that is why amsterdam was chosen for a recent international get together of the open source movement .
the movement believes strongly that rather than being a trade secret , the source code of the software should be open for anyone to play with .
the result is software like the linux operating system , created through collaboration that can involve thousands of programmers .
" early on , when software was developed by computer scientists , just people working with computers , people passed around software because that was how you got computers to do things , " explained tim o 'reilly , the founder and ceo of computer information and publishing company o 'reilly media .
" what we take as the shape of the software industry today , where software is shrink-wrapped and sold , is really a 20-year anomaly that started in the 1980s .
" now we have companies like microsoft as the avatars of that movement .
but by the mid-80s there were already people saying ' we do n't like this ' . "
and what they did not like was the idea of closing off information , especially information that others could build on .
rich pickings the open source movement does not object to making money .
in fact , many of these programmers can afford to be choosy about how they earn .

we have just built a world-wide copying machine called the internet karl fogel , collabnet the source code may be free , but there is gold in software support , training and publishing .
damian conway , who trains programmers through his business thoughtstream , said : " i think the most successful of those is definitely licensing support ; providing the software and then saying : ' if you want to buy a support contract , here 's what it will cost you on an ongoing basis ' .
" that way people are getting something that they can work with free if they want to , but when they get into trouble they have backup and you make some money out of it . "
with businesses keen on open source software and the support it offers , geek chic is smartening up .
and the software , as well , is now designed by , but not necessarily for , programmers .
open source might be more user friendly , but can it really go toe-to-toe with the giants in the market place ?
supporters of open source say it brings innovations to the market open source has been criticised for devoting so much energy to coming up with open source alternatives to what is already commercially available .

oxfordshire county council set up the trading standards team to go out to homes as quickly as possible to stop workmen demanding undeserved cash .
the team attends while workmen are still at residents ' properties to stop them intimidating or bullying them .
the council estimates it has saved locals more than £ 30,000 this summer .
the team has responded to complaints of workmen carrying out roofing , building , driveway or garden work and then increasing the quoted cost .
ray jelf , the council 's cabinet member for community safety , said : " the success in saving £ 30,000 for oxfordshire residents is merely the tip of the iceberg .
" often these incidents go unreported but the rogue trader team will continue to provide help when needed . "
