it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

" eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

italy , denmark up security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish police are out to calm a nervous public following the london bombings , italy and denmark were named as possible targets on a web site popular with islamic militants .
both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .
their presence on the city 's transport system is designed to deter potential bombers and calm public fears . security services all over denmark are working overtime to thwart those who would punish the country 's alliance with us president george w. bush , as well as what many immigrants regard as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's hostile right-wing government . further south , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has presented a 19-point anti-terror plan to the italian senate .
the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets . " we continue to warn the governments of denmark and italy and all crusader governments that they will receive the same punishment if they do not withdraw their troops from iraq and afghanistan , " read the statement , published on a web site popular with islamic militants , by a group calling itself the " secret organization of al qaeda in europe .

it is the same group that claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings earlier this month on london 's transport network . italians fear imminent attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers patrol at the entrance of the central railway station in milan , italy , wednesday july 13 , 2005 .
" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .
i do n't think the danger is that big , but we ca n't guarantee that somewhere in the city , there is n't a crazy person or group who are convinced they 're doing the right thing . " denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry . " i am certain that al qaeda is operating in denmark , " yuksekkaya , who has conducted a study of every mosque in greater copenhagen , said .
" and i 'm convinced that their friends and relatives know what 's going on , but they 're turning a blind eye . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque in london .
such sentiments offend moderate danish muslims such as zahid butt , who runs a web site for pakistanis in denmark .

he completed it in 1982 . just two years later , he became responsible for the coordination and development of utility vehicles abroad , a charge which led him to different managerial positions in brazil , argentina and the united states . daring to be different even in those early years , he won praise for being bold enough to change the traditional way of doing things within the company , notably for having development and production experts work together in a bid to cut development costs . it was a coup and one of the reasons for his appointment in 1995 to the management board from where he watched outgoing ceo jürgen schrempp merge mercedes benz with us automobile manufacturer chrysler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen schrempp news of the fusion was met with great excitement on both sides , but the euphoria was soon replaced with the realization that managing the two companies under one roof was going to be a tricky business . in essence , the two companies were too similar to really complement one another , and there was concern back at home that the merger would damage mercedes benz 's dominant market share .

at the time , a marketing expert called james holden was brought in to save the day . but the mess he inherited was too big to untangle . so the baton was passed to dieter zetsche , who waved it ruthlessly , slashing 26,000 jobs and closing six factories .

italy , denmark up security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish police are out to calm a nervous public following the london bombings , italy and denmark were named as possible targets on a web site popular with islamic militants .
both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .

the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets . " we continue to warn the governments of denmark and italy and all crusader governments that they will receive the same punishment if they do not withdraw their troops from iraq and afghanistan , " read the statement , published on a web site popular with islamic militants , by a group calling itself the " secret organization of al qaeda in europe .

" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .
i do n't think the danger is that big , but we ca n't guarantee that somewhere in the city , there is n't a crazy person or group who are convinced they 're doing the right thing . " denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry . " i am certain that al qaeda is operating in denmark , " yuksekkaya , who has conducted a study of every mosque in greater copenhagen , said .
" and i 'm convinced that their friends and relatives know what 's going on , but they 're turning a blind eye . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque in london .
such sentiments offend moderate danish muslims such as zahid butt , who runs a web site for pakistanis in denmark .
he regards yuksekkaya as a scare mongerer . " i ca n't recognize that picture at all , " butt said .
" if there is a problem within the muslim community , then most of the community will react , because the problem would mean that they and their families are also at risk .

italy , denmark up security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish police are out to calm a nervous public following the london bombings , italy and denmark were named as possible targets on a web site popular with islamic militants .
both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .
their presence on the city 's transport system is designed to deter potential bombers and calm public fears . security services all over denmark are working overtime to thwart those who would punish the country 's alliance with us president george w. bush , as well as what many immigrants regard as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's hostile right-wing government . further south , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has presented a 19-point anti-terror plan to the italian senate .
the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets . " we continue to warn the governments of denmark and italy and all crusader governments that they will receive the same punishment if they do not withdraw their troops from iraq and afghanistan , " read the statement , published on a web site popular with islamic militants , by a group calling itself the " secret organization of al qaeda in europe . "
it is the same group that claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings earlier this month on london 's transport network . italians fear imminent attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers patrol at the entrance of the central railway station in milan , italy , wednesday july 13 , 2005 .
" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .

the stock market greeted the announcement . jürgen schrempp 's exit does not exactly come as a surprise .
the daimlerchrysler ceo has faced intense criticism from analysts and shareholders for his ambitious strategy of international development . " the supervisory board and jürgen schrempp agree that the end of 2005 would be the perfect time for a change in leadership , " the daimlerchrysler supervisory board said thursday in a tersely-worded statement leaving out the usual words of thanks for the outgoing boss . hours later in another surprise development , the web site germany 's manager-magazin reported that mercedes boss eckhard cordes had asked the daimlerchrysler supervisory board to dissolve his contract .
the board had requested time to mull the issue , the magazine wrote , quoting " informed sources . " cordes apparently cited the lack of complete support from the supervisory board for his difficult job of restructuring mercedes as one reason for his wish to step down . schrempp " ruined a good brand " under schrempp 's leadership , daimler acquired chrysler only to see the company enter a serious downward spiral . daimlerchrysler 's operating profit dropped , its asian expansion scheme faltered with the addition of troubled japanese manufacturer mitsubishi motors , and traditional cash cow mercedes struggled with the strong euro , spending to fix quality problems and hefty losses at its smart minicar brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the news of schrempp 's departure , the company 's stock had its biggest gain in three years , with the price of shares rising 8 percent in early trading on the frankfurt stock exchange . analysts on thursday said schrempp 's resignation was overdue . " schrempp took several wrong strategic decisions in the past , " analyst jürgen pieper told reuters .
" schrempp has disastrously failed in his plans to create a global car company , " said a stockbroker .
" he ruined a good brand with his acquisitions of mitsubishi and even chrysler . " voluntary departure a company spokesman said that schrempp was leaving the world 's fifth-largest carmaker of his own will and was not forced out . " he has left voluntarily after a dialogue with the supervisory board , " the spokesman said , adding that although schrempp 's contract runs until 2008 , he will only draw his salary until the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche schrempp , 60 , will be replaced by dieter zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped return the us-based chrysler division to profitability , the company said in a statement .
analyst jürgen pieper said zetsche 's appointment " will blow some fresh wind into daimlerchrysler . " apart from bringing in some much-needed dynamism , zetsche 's arrival is also expected to be a stabilizing factor . erich klemm , head of the workers ' council at daimlerchrysler indicated thursday that zetsche would honor the agreements hammered out between the management and the workers ' council and avoid layoffs linked to the company 's performance . zetsche will be replaced by thomas lasorda as chrysler 's leader , with the changes taking effect at the start of 2006 . the news of schrempp 's resignation came as the company reported improved second-quarter earnings and a slight rise in sales . schrempp 's history with daimlerchrysler stretches back over 44 years , during which he held a variety of management positions , including the leadership of daimler-benz operations in south africa , the united states and germany as well as 17 years as chairman of daimler-benz aerospace and daimlerchrysler . schrempp began his career with the company in 1961 as an apprentice mechanic and joined the company 's stuttgart headquarters in 1967 . dw staff -lrb- dc , sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo gets a bruising as expected , daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp got a verbal beating at the annual shareholder 's meeting on wednesday .

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct . "
the president is " a man with whom you can speak very openly , " schäuble said . " i am pleased to have been received by such high-ranking people , " he said .
" this shows that the us government is interested in good relations with germany . " reviving relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush met angela merkel on a recent visit to mainz .
in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .
german foreign policy has to find a way back to a traditional balance between good relations with the us and france . " under schröder 's leadership , relations with the us soured when germany and france sided together in opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . summing up his discussion with the president , schäuble said he 'd made it clear that a future conservative government would n't do everything differently from the spd-green coalition , nor could the us expect that germany would always share its opinion .
what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than full membership .
aside from the state of us-german relations , other topics on the table included iran 's nuclear program .
schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .
merkel has already said she does not intend to deploy german soldiers there if she is elected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

the stock market greeted the announcement . jürgen schrempp 's exit does not exactly come as a surprise .
the daimlerchrysler ceo has faced intense criticism from analysts and shareholders for his ambitious strategy of international development . " the supervisory board and jürgen schrempp agree that the end of 2005 would be the perfect time for a change in leadership , " the daimlerchrysler supervisory board said thursday in a tersely-worded statement leaving out the usual words of thanks for the outgoing boss . hours later in another surprise development , the web site germany 's manager-magazin reported that mercedes boss eckhard cordes had asked the daimlerchrysler supervisory board to dissolve his contract .
the board had requested time to mull the issue , the magazine wrote , quoting " informed sources . " cordes apparently cited the lack of complete support from the supervisory board for his difficult job of restructuring mercedes as one reason for his wish to step down . schrempp " ruined a good brand " under schrempp 's leadership , daimler acquired chrysler only to see the company enter a serious downward spiral . daimlerchrysler 's operating profit dropped , its asian expansion scheme faltered with the addition of troubled japanese manufacturer mitsubishi motors , and traditional cash cow mercedes struggled with the strong euro , spending to fix quality problems and hefty losses at its smart minicar brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the news of schrempp 's departure , the company 's stock had its biggest gain in three years , with the price of shares rising 8 percent in early trading on the frankfurt stock exchange . analysts on thursday said schrempp 's resignation was overdue . " schrempp took several wrong strategic decisions in the past , " analyst jürgen pieper told reuters .
" schrempp has disastrously failed in his plans to create a global car company , " said a stockbroker .
" he ruined a good brand with his acquisitions of mitsubishi and even chrysler . " voluntary departure a company spokesman said that schrempp was leaving the world 's fifth-largest carmaker of his own will and was not forced out . " he has left voluntarily after a dialogue with the supervisory board , " the spokesman said , adding that although schrempp 's contract runs until 2008 , he will only draw his salary until the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche schrempp , 60 , will be replaced by dieter zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped return the us-based chrysler division to profitability , the company said in a statement .
analyst jürgen pieper said zetsche 's appointment " will blow some fresh wind into daimlerchrysler . " apart from bringing in some much-needed dynamism , zetsche 's arrival is also expected to be a stabilizing factor . erich klemm , head of the workers ' council at daimlerchrysler indicated thursday that zetsche would honor the agreements hammered out between the management and the workers ' council and avoid layoffs linked to the company 's performance . zetsche will be replaced by thomas lasorda as chrysler 's leader , with the changes taking effect at the start of 2006 . the news of schrempp 's resignation came as the company reported improved second-quarter earnings and a slight rise in sales . schrempp 's history with daimlerchrysler stretches back over 44 years , during which he held a variety of management positions , including the leadership of daimler-benz operations in south africa , the united states and germany as well as 17 years as chairman of daimler-benz aerospace and daimlerchrysler . schrempp began his career with the company in 1961 as an apprentice mechanic and joined the company 's stuttgart headquarters in 1967 . dw staff -lrb- dc , sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo gets a bruising as expected , daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp got a verbal beating at the annual shareholder 's meeting on wednesday .

the stock market greeted the announcement . jürgen schrempp 's exit does not exactly come as a surprise .
the daimlerchrysler ceo has faced intense criticism from analysts and shareholders for his ambitious strategy of international development . " the supervisory board and jürgen schrempp agree that the end of 2005 would be the perfect time for a change in leadership , " the daimlerchrysler supervisory board said thursday in a tersely-worded statement leaving out the usual words of thanks for the outgoing boss . hours later in another surprise development , the web site germany 's manager-magazin reported that mercedes boss eckhard cordes had asked the daimlerchrysler supervisory board to dissolve his contract .
the board had requested time to mull the issue , the magazine wrote , quoting " informed sources . " cordes apparently cited the lack of complete support from the supervisory board for his difficult job of restructuring mercedes as one reason for his wish to step down . schrempp " ruined a good brand " under schrempp 's leadership , daimler acquired chrysler only to see the company enter a serious downward spiral . daimlerchrysler 's operating profit dropped , its asian expansion scheme faltered with the addition of troubled japanese manufacturer mitsubishi motors , and traditional cash cow mercedes struggled with the strong euro , spending to fix quality problems and hefty losses at its smart minicar brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the news of schrempp 's departure , the company 's stock had its biggest gain in three years , with the price of shares rising 8 percent in early trading on the frankfurt stock exchange . analysts on thursday said schrempp 's resignation was overdue . " schrempp took several wrong strategic decisions in the past , " analyst jürgen pieper told reuters .
" schrempp has disastrously failed in his plans to create a global car company , " said a stockbroker .
" he ruined a good brand with his acquisitions of mitsubishi and even chrysler . " voluntary departure a company spokesman said that schrempp was leaving the world 's fifth-largest carmaker of his own will and was not forced out . " he has left voluntarily after a dialogue with the supervisory board , " the spokesman said , adding that although schrempp 's contract runs until 2008 , he will only draw his salary until the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche schrempp , 60 , will be replaced by dieter zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped return the us-based chrysler division to profitability , the company said in a statement .
analyst jürgen pieper said zetsche 's appointment " will blow some fresh wind into daimlerchrysler . " apart from bringing in some much-needed dynamism , zetsche 's arrival is also expected to be a stabilizing factor . erich klemm , head of the workers ' council at daimlerchrysler indicated thursday that zetsche would honor the agreements hammered out between the management and the workers ' council and avoid layoffs linked to the company 's performance . zetsche will be replaced by thomas lasorda as chrysler 's leader , with the changes taking effect at the start of 2006 . the news of schrempp 's resignation came as the company reported improved second-quarter earnings and a slight rise in sales . schrempp 's history with daimlerchrysler stretches back over 44 years , during which he held a variety of management positions , including the leadership of daimler-benz operations in south africa , the united states and germany as well as 17 years as chairman of daimler-benz aerospace and daimlerchrysler . schrempp began his career with the company in 1961 as an apprentice mechanic and joined the company 's stuttgart headquarters in 1967 . dw staff -lrb- dc , sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo gets a bruising as expected , daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp got a verbal beating at the annual shareholder 's meeting on wednesday .

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct . "
the president is " a man with whom you can speak very openly , " schäuble said . " i am pleased to have been received by such high-ranking people , " he said .
" this shows that the us government is interested in good relations with germany . " reviving relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush met angela merkel on a recent visit to mainz .
in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .
german foreign policy has to find a way back to a traditional balance between good relations with the us and france . " under schröder 's leadership , relations with the us soured when germany and france sided together in opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . summing up his discussion with the president , schäuble said he 'd made it clear that a future conservative government would n't do everything differently from the spd-green coalition , nor could the us expect that germany would always share its opinion .
what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than full membership .
aside from the state of us-german relations , other topics on the table included iran 's nuclear program .
schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .
merkel has already said she does not intend to deploy german soldiers there if she is elected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct . "
the president is " a man with whom you can speak very openly , " schäuble said . " i am pleased to have been received by such high-ranking people , " he said .
" this shows that the us government is interested in good relations with germany . " reviving relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush met angela merkel on a recent visit to mainz .
in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .
german foreign policy has to find a way back to a traditional balance between good relations with the us and france . " under schröder 's leadership , relations with the us soured when germany and france sided together in opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . summing up his discussion with the president , schäuble said he 'd made it clear that a future conservative government would n't do everything differently from the spd-green coalition , nor could the us expect that germany would always share its opinion .
what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than full membership .
aside from the state of us-german relations , other topics on the table included iran 's nuclear program .
schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .
merkel has already said she does not intend to deploy german soldiers there if she is elected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.07.2005 the high cost of security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms invest increasingly in smart security like this iris scanner terrorism could pose a serious threat to world business , according to german trade group bga .
it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .

what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than full membership .
aside from the state of us-german relations , other topics on the table included iran 's nuclear program .
schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .
merkel has already said she does not intend to deploy german soldiers there if she is elected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .

but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct . "
the president is " a man with whom you can speak very openly , " schäuble said . " i am pleased to have been received by such high-ranking people , " he said .
" this shows that the us government is interested in good relations with germany . " reviving relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush met angela merkel on a recent visit to mainz .
in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.07.2005 the high cost of security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms invest increasingly in smart security like this iris scanner terrorism could pose a serious threat to world business , according to german trade group bga .
it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.07.2005 the new face of daimlerchrysler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche , the new man at the daimlerchrylser helm stock markets reacted positively thursday to the news that jürgen schrempp is standing down after a decade in the top spot , and there are high hopes for his successor , dieter zetsche as well . zetsche and daimler embarked on their long-standing relationship back in the mid-1970s , when the turkish-born graduate joined the company after completing his studies in electro-technology at the university of karlsruhe . he began his long career in the research and development department , while simultaneously working on his doctorate in engineering at the technical university in the german town of padeborn .
he completed it in 1982 . just two years later , he became responsible for the coordination and development of utility vehicles abroad , a charge which led him to different managerial positions in brazil , argentina and the united states . daring to be different even in those early years , he won praise for being bold enough to change the traditional way of doing things within the company , notably for having development and production experts work together in a bid to cut development costs . it was a coup and one of the reasons for his appointment in 1995 to the management board from where he watched outgoing ceo jürgen schrempp merge mercedes benz with us automobile manufacturer chrysler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen schrempp news of the fusion was met with great excitement on both sides , but the euphoria was soon replaced with the realization that managing the two companies under one roof was going to be a tricky business . in essence , the two companies were too similar to really complement one another , and there was concern back at home that the merger would damage mercedes benz 's dominant market share .
with that in mind , schrempp did n't set about immediately transferring what was widely seen as its superior technology into the engines of chrysler vehicles . chrysler savior instead , in november 2000 , he transferred dieter zetsche , then 47-years-old and head of the company 's commercial vehicle business , to shake up daimler 's new partner which was sinking in a sea of its own red ink . part of the problem was that many of chrysler 's top executives had jumped ship right after the merger . some had grown rich on stock awards which were part of the fusion deal , while others could n't get used to taking orders from the headquarters in stuttgart .
at the time , a marketing expert called james holden was brought in to save the day . but the mess he inherited was too big to untangle . so the baton was passed to dieter zetsche , who waved it ruthlessly , slashing 26,000 jobs and closing six factories .
unsurprisingly , he quickly became the enemy new boy on the block . but the chrysler workers did n't dislike him for long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.07.2005 all four london bombing suspects arrested großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police carried out a number of raids across london on friday in extraordinary scenes in both london and rome , police investigating the attempted bombings in london on july 21 arrested all four suspected would-be suicide bombers who failed to repeat the atrocities of july 7 . london has sadly become accustomed to scenes of high drama in recent weeks and the events in a west london suburb and in other areas across the capital on friday added yet more chapters to a story of tragedy and suspense that has horrified and gripped the nation and the rest of the world . at around 11:00 utc , armed police surrounded two houses in dalgarno gardens , a run-down estate of public housing apartments in the white city area , before firing tear-gas canisters and apparently throwing stun grenades into the houses where two of the four suspected july 21 bombers were suspected of being holed up . the raid took place a few hundred meters from where a fifth bomb was found abandoned in bushes two days after the failed attacks . as startled residents ran for safety , some not even given enough time to get dressed , police surrounding the properties shouted instructions to the men - thought at the time to be eritrean-born hackney bus bomber muktar mohammed said , also known as muktar said ibrahim - and another unnamed suspect . police arrest suspect " mohammed " " mohammed , come out with -lrb- only -rrb- your underwear on and your hands up . "
a police officer at the scene was heard to shout to which came the reply : " why should i come out like that ? "
the police officer then shouted : " we need to check you have n't got explosives on you . " after an agonizing wait and repeated calls for the men to come out , the police made their move .
two short but loud explosions rang out across the suburban streets as stun grenades were fired into the houses .
a flurry of activity followed as armed officers stormed the buildings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some moments later , two officers in full forensic suits led a third man , also in full overalls , from the rear of the house to an unmarked car .
the suspect and officers then sped away to london 's high security paddington green police station .
another followed shortly after carrying the second suspect . three july 21 bombers caught in england if their identities and connections are confirmed , the two men will join somali-born yasin hassan omar in custody as three of the failed suicide bombers responsible for attempted attacks on july 21 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasin hassan omar omar , accused of trying to bomb an underground train at warrant street tube station , was arrested in a similar raid in birmingham , central england , on wednesday where he was disabled by a tazer stun gun before being driven to the capital for questioning . fourth suspect arrested in rome the fourth suspected bomber was later said to be in custody in rome , making it a very successful day for the investigation into the attempted july 21 bombings and the far deadlier july 7 attacks .
" the arrest took place a short while ago in rome of the somali , osman hussain , a naturalized british citizen , the fourth attacker in london on july 21 , " italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement .
" the anti-terrorism operation is still ongoing , and has been conducted in the context of close international collaboration . "
he gave no details about the arrest . the ansa news agency said hussain was seized by a special police anti-terrorist cell , the digos , from an apartment in the tor pignattara area on the periphery of the italian capital at about 14:30 uct .
he was then taken to rome police headquarters , the agency said . the four would-be london bombers mounted their abortive attacks exactly two weeks after four suspected islamist militants killed themselves and 52 other people in blasts on three underground trains and a bus in london . raids across city , arrests at liverpool street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as the raid in dalgarno gardens , police sealed off streets around notting hill , another part of west london , and mounted another raid , residents said .
and at liverpool street station , just on the eastern edge of the city center , armed police made yet more arrests , a spokesman for british transport police said .
a witness told afp he saw two women wearing islamic scarves pinned down by officers after they ran away when stopped for a routine check . police operations continue apace across the uk .
nine men were arrested by police in tooting , south london , on thursday , bringing the total number of people held under anti-terrorist laws over the london attacks to 20 . in other developments , haroon rashid aswad , a briton linked in media reports to an attempt to set up a militant training camp in the united states as well as being suspected of involvement in the july 7 london bombings , was arrested in zambia , according to interpol reports . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heart of europe vulnerable to terrorism brussels , the capital of europe , would be vulnerable to a terror attack on its public transport system and would be ill-prepared to deal with an incident on the scale of the london bombings , officials said on tuesday .

both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .
their presence on the city 's transport system is designed to deter potential bombers and calm public fears . security services all over denmark are working overtime to thwart those who would punish the country 's alliance with us president george w. bush , as well as what many immigrants regard as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's hostile right-wing government . further south , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has presented a 19-point anti-terror plan to the italian senate .
the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets . " we continue to warn the governments of denmark and italy and all crusader governments that they will receive the same punishment if they do not withdraw their troops from iraq and afghanistan , " read the statement , published on a web site popular with islamic militants , by a group calling itself the " secret organization of al qaeda in europe .

one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .
i do n't think the danger is that big , but we ca n't guarantee that somewhere in the city , there is n't a crazy person or group who are convinced they 're doing the right thing . " denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry . " i am certain that al qaeda is operating in denmark , " yuksekkaya , who has conducted a study of every mosque in greater copenhagen , said .
" and i 'm convinced that their friends and relatives know what 's going on , but they 're turning a blind eye . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque in london .
such sentiments offend moderate danish muslims such as zahid butt , who runs a web site for pakistanis in denmark .
he regards yuksekkaya as a scare mongerer . " i ca n't recognize that picture at all , " butt said .
" if there is a problem within the muslim community , then most of the community will react , because the problem would mean that they and their families are also at risk .
it there is a threat in denmark , then i too am threatened .

" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .
i do n't think the danger is that big , but we ca n't guarantee that somewhere in the city , there is n't a crazy person or group who are convinced they 're doing the right thing . " denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry . " i am certain that al qaeda is operating in denmark , " yuksekkaya , who has conducted a study of every mosque in greater copenhagen , said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.07.2005 the new face of daimlerchrysler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche , the new man at the daimlerchrylser helm stock markets reacted positively thursday to the news that jürgen schrempp is standing down after a decade in the top spot , and there are high hopes for his successor , dieter zetsche as well . zetsche and daimler embarked on their long-standing relationship back in the mid-1970s , when the turkish-born graduate joined the company after completing his studies in electro-technology at the university of karlsruhe . he began his long career in the research and development department , while simultaneously working on his doctorate in engineering at the technical university in the german town of padeborn .
he completed it in 1982 . just two years later , he became responsible for the coordination and development of utility vehicles abroad , a charge which led him to different managerial positions in brazil , argentina and the united states . daring to be different even in those early years , he won praise for being bold enough to change the traditional way of doing things within the company , notably for having development and production experts work together in a bid to cut development costs . it was a coup and one of the reasons for his appointment in 1995 to the management board from where he watched outgoing ceo jürgen schrempp merge mercedes benz with us automobile manufacturer chrysler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen schrempp news of the fusion was met with great excitement on both sides , but the euphoria was soon replaced with the realization that managing the two companies under one roof was going to be a tricky business . in essence , the two companies were too similar to really complement one another , and there was concern back at home that the merger would damage mercedes benz 's dominant market share .
with that in mind , schrempp did n't set about immediately transferring what was widely seen as its superior technology into the engines of chrysler vehicles . chrysler savior instead , in november 2000 , he transferred dieter zetsche , then 47-years-old and head of the company 's commercial vehicle business , to shake up daimler 's new partner which was sinking in a sea of its own red ink . part of the problem was that many of chrysler 's top executives had jumped ship right after the merger . some had grown rich on stock awards which were part of the fusion deal , while others could n't get used to taking orders from the headquarters in stuttgart .
at the time , a marketing expert called james holden was brought in to save the day . but the mess he inherited was too big to untangle . so the baton was passed to dieter zetsche , who waved it ruthlessly , slashing 26,000 jobs and closing six factories .
unsurprisingly , he quickly became the enemy new boy on the block . but the chrysler workers did n't dislike him for long .

with that in mind , schrempp did n't set about immediately transferring what was widely seen as its superior technology into the engines of chrysler vehicles . chrysler savior instead , in november 2000 , he transferred dieter zetsche , then 47-years-old and head of the company 's commercial vehicle business , to shake up daimler 's new partner which was sinking in a sea of its own red ink . part of the problem was that many of chrysler 's top executives had jumped ship right after the merger . some had grown rich on stock awards which were part of the fusion deal , while others could n't get used to taking orders from the headquarters in stuttgart .
at the time , a marketing expert called james holden was brought in to save the day . but the mess he inherited was too big to untangle . so the baton was passed to dieter zetsche , who waved it ruthlessly , slashing 26,000 jobs and closing six factories .
unsurprisingly , he quickly became the enemy new boy on the block . but the chrysler workers did n't dislike him for long .
wooed by what is often described as his caring attitude and easy manner , they took to him and his ways . yet beneath his smiling moustache , there is no doubt that zetsche can play tough and that he is not afraid to do so . successful turnaround in his five years as head of chrysler , he has proved his worth , and pulled the company up out of the doldrums .
in the second quarter of this year , the us company posted an operating profit gain of 4 percent to 544 million euros -lrb- $ 657 million -rrb- , which was above analysts ' estimates of 412 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failing smart is one of the reasons behind daimlerchryler 's problems now , zetsche has to work his magic back home where mercedes has been struggling to keep afloat against the strong euro and compensate for losses incurred through its smart mini-car brand .
he takes over as the new ceo of daimlerchrysler on january 1 , 2006 . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo gets a bruising as expected , daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp got a verbal beating at the annual shareholder 's meeting on wednesday .

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct .

in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .
german foreign policy has to find a way back to a traditional balance between good relations with the us and france . " under schröder 's leadership , relations with the us soured when germany and france sided together in opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . summing up his discussion with the president , schäuble said he 'd made it clear that a future conservative government would n't do everything differently from the spd-green coalition , nor could the us expect that germany would always share its opinion .
what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than full membership .
aside from the state of us-german relations , other topics on the table included iran 's nuclear program .
schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .

the stock market greeted the announcement . jürgen schrempp 's exit does not exactly come as a surprise .
the daimlerchrysler ceo has faced intense criticism from analysts and shareholders for his ambitious strategy of international development . " the supervisory board and jürgen schrempp agree that the end of 2005 would be the perfect time for a change in leadership , " the daimlerchrysler supervisory board said thursday in a tersely-worded statement leaving out the usual words of thanks for the outgoing boss . hours later in another surprise development , the web site germany 's manager-magazin reported that mercedes boss eckhard cordes had asked the daimlerchrysler supervisory board to dissolve his contract .
the board had requested time to mull the issue , the magazine wrote , quoting " informed sources . " cordes apparently cited the lack of complete support from the supervisory board for his difficult job of restructuring mercedes as one reason for his wish to step down . schrempp " ruined a good brand " under schrempp 's leadership , daimler acquired chrysler only to see the company enter a serious downward spiral . daimlerchrysler 's operating profit dropped , its asian expansion scheme faltered with the addition of troubled japanese manufacturer mitsubishi motors , and traditional cash cow mercedes struggled with the strong euro , spending to fix quality problems and hefty losses at its smart minicar brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the news of schrempp 's departure , the company 's stock had its biggest gain in three years , with the price of shares rising 8 percent in early trading on the frankfurt stock exchange . analysts on thursday said schrempp 's resignation was overdue . " schrempp took several wrong strategic decisions in the past , " analyst jürgen pieper told reuters .
" schrempp has disastrously failed in his plans to create a global car company , " said a stockbroker .
" he ruined a good brand with his acquisitions of mitsubishi and even chrysler . " voluntary departure a company spokesman said that schrempp was leaving the world 's fifth-largest carmaker of his own will and was not forced out . " he has left voluntarily after a dialogue with the supervisory board , " the spokesman said , adding that although schrempp 's contract runs until 2008 , he will only draw his salary until the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche schrempp , 60 , will be replaced by dieter zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped return the us-based chrysler division to profitability , the company said in a statement .
analyst jürgen pieper said zetsche 's appointment " will blow some fresh wind into daimlerchrysler . " apart from bringing in some much-needed dynamism , zetsche 's arrival is also expected to be a stabilizing factor . erich klemm , head of the workers ' council at daimlerchrysler indicated thursday that zetsche would honor the agreements hammered out between the management and the workers ' council and avoid layoffs linked to the company 's performance . zetsche will be replaced by thomas lasorda as chrysler 's leader , with the changes taking effect at the start of 2006 . the news of schrempp 's resignation came as the company reported improved second-quarter earnings and a slight rise in sales . schrempp 's history with daimlerchrysler stretches back over 44 years , during which he held a variety of management positions , including the leadership of daimler-benz operations in south africa , the united states and germany as well as 17 years as chairman of daimler-benz aerospace and daimlerchrysler . schrempp began his career with the company in 1961 as an apprentice mechanic and joined the company 's stuttgart headquarters in 1967 . dw staff -lrb- dc , sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo gets a bruising as expected , daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp got a verbal beating at the annual shareholder 's meeting on wednesday .

the stock market greeted the announcement . jürgen schrempp 's exit does not exactly come as a surprise .
the daimlerchrysler ceo has faced intense criticism from analysts and shareholders for his ambitious strategy of international development . " the supervisory board and jürgen schrempp agree that the end of 2005 would be the perfect time for a change in leadership , " the daimlerchrysler supervisory board said thursday in a tersely-worded statement leaving out the usual words of thanks for the outgoing boss . hours later in another surprise development , the web site germany 's manager-magazin reported that mercedes boss eckhard cordes had asked the daimlerchrysler supervisory board to dissolve his contract .
the board had requested time to mull the issue , the magazine wrote , quoting " informed sources . " cordes apparently cited the lack of complete support from the supervisory board for his difficult job of restructuring mercedes as one reason for his wish to step down . schrempp " ruined a good brand " under schrempp 's leadership , daimler acquired chrysler only to see the company enter a serious downward spiral . daimlerchrysler 's operating profit dropped , its asian expansion scheme faltered with the addition of troubled japanese manufacturer mitsubishi motors , and traditional cash cow mercedes struggled with the strong euro , spending to fix quality problems and hefty losses at its smart minicar brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the news of schrempp 's departure , the company 's stock had its biggest gain in three years , with the price of shares rising 8 percent in early trading on the frankfurt stock exchange . analysts on thursday said schrempp 's resignation was overdue . " schrempp took several wrong strategic decisions in the past , " analyst jürgen pieper told reuters .
" schrempp has disastrously failed in his plans to create a global car company , " said a stockbroker .
" he ruined a good brand with his acquisitions of mitsubishi and even chrysler . " voluntary departure a company spokesman said that schrempp was leaving the world 's fifth-largest carmaker of his own will and was not forced out . " he has left voluntarily after a dialogue with the supervisory board , " the spokesman said , adding that although schrempp 's contract runs until 2008 , he will only draw his salary until the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche schrempp , 60 , will be replaced by dieter zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped return the us-based chrysler division to profitability , the company said in a statement .
analyst jürgen pieper said zetsche 's appointment " will blow some fresh wind into daimlerchrysler . " apart from bringing in some much-needed dynamism , zetsche 's arrival is also expected to be a stabilizing factor . erich klemm , head of the workers ' council at daimlerchrysler indicated thursday that zetsche would honor the agreements hammered out between the management and the workers ' council and avoid layoffs linked to the company 's performance . zetsche will be replaced by thomas lasorda as chrysler 's leader , with the changes taking effect at the start of 2006 . the news of schrempp 's resignation came as the company reported improved second-quarter earnings and a slight rise in sales . schrempp 's history with daimlerchrysler stretches back over 44 years , during which he held a variety of management positions , including the leadership of daimler-benz operations in south africa , the united states and germany as well as 17 years as chairman of daimler-benz aerospace and daimlerchrysler . schrempp began his career with the company in 1961 as an apprentice mechanic and joined the company 's stuttgart headquarters in 1967 . dw staff -lrb- dc , sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo gets a bruising as expected , daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp got a verbal beating at the annual shareholder 's meeting on wednesday .

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .

" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

he completed it in 1982 . just two years later , he became responsible for the coordination and development of utility vehicles abroad , a charge which led him to different managerial positions in brazil , argentina and the united states . daring to be different even in those early years , he won praise for being bold enough to change the traditional way of doing things within the company , notably for having development and production experts work together in a bid to cut development costs . it was a coup and one of the reasons for his appointment in 1995 to the management board from where he watched outgoing ceo jürgen schrempp merge mercedes benz with us automobile manufacturer chrysler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen schrempp news of the fusion was met with great excitement on both sides , but the euphoria was soon replaced with the realization that managing the two companies under one roof was going to be a tricky business . in essence , the two companies were too similar to really complement one another , and there was concern back at home that the merger would damage mercedes benz 's dominant market share .
with that in mind , schrempp did n't set about immediately transferring what was widely seen as its superior technology into the engines of chrysler vehicles . chrysler savior instead , in november 2000 , he transferred dieter zetsche , then 47-years-old and head of the company 's commercial vehicle business , to shake up daimler 's new partner which was sinking in a sea of its own red ink . part of the problem was that many of chrysler 's top executives had jumped ship right after the merger . some had grown rich on stock awards which were part of the fusion deal , while others could n't get used to taking orders from the headquarters in stuttgart .
at the time , a marketing expert called james holden was brought in to save the day . but the mess he inherited was too big to untangle . so the baton was passed to dieter zetsche , who waved it ruthlessly , slashing 26,000 jobs and closing six factories .
unsurprisingly , he quickly became the enemy new boy on the block . but the chrysler workers did n't dislike him for long .
wooed by what is often described as his caring attitude and easy manner , they took to him and his ways . yet beneath his smiling moustache , there is no doubt that zetsche can play tough and that he is not afraid to do so . successful turnaround in his five years as head of chrysler , he has proved his worth , and pulled the company up out of the doldrums .
in the second quarter of this year , the us company posted an operating profit gain of 4 percent to 544 million euros -lrb- $ 657 million -rrb- , which was above analysts ' estimates of 412 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failing smart is one of the reasons behind daimlerchryler 's problems now , zetsche has to work his magic back home where mercedes has been struggling to keep afloat against the strong euro and compensate for losses incurred through its smart mini-car brand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.07.2005 the high cost of security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms invest increasingly in smart security like this iris scanner terrorism could pose a serious threat to world business , according to german trade group bga .
it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .
merkel has already said she does not intend to deploy german soldiers there if she is elected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

the stock market greeted the announcement . jürgen schrempp 's exit does not exactly come as a surprise .
the daimlerchrysler ceo has faced intense criticism from analysts and shareholders for his ambitious strategy of international development . " the supervisory board and jürgen schrempp agree that the end of 2005 would be the perfect time for a change in leadership , " the daimlerchrysler supervisory board said thursday in a tersely-worded statement leaving out the usual words of thanks for the outgoing boss . hours later in another surprise development , the web site germany 's manager-magazin reported that mercedes boss eckhard cordes had asked the daimlerchrysler supervisory board to dissolve his contract .
the board had requested time to mull the issue , the magazine wrote , quoting " informed sources . " cordes apparently cited the lack of complete support from the supervisory board for his difficult job of restructuring mercedes as one reason for his wish to step down . schrempp " ruined a good brand " under schrempp 's leadership , daimler acquired chrysler only to see the company enter a serious downward spiral . daimlerchrysler 's operating profit dropped , its asian expansion scheme faltered with the addition of troubled japanese manufacturer mitsubishi motors , and traditional cash cow mercedes struggled with the strong euro , spending to fix quality problems and hefty losses at its smart minicar brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the news of schrempp 's departure , the company 's stock had its biggest gain in three years , with the price of shares rising 8 percent in early trading on the frankfurt stock exchange . analysts on thursday said schrempp 's resignation was overdue . " schrempp took several wrong strategic decisions in the past , " analyst jürgen pieper told reuters .
" schrempp has disastrously failed in his plans to create a global car company , " said a stockbroker .
" he ruined a good brand with his acquisitions of mitsubishi and even chrysler . " voluntary departure a company spokesman said that schrempp was leaving the world 's fifth-largest carmaker of his own will and was not forced out . " he has left voluntarily after a dialogue with the supervisory board , " the spokesman said , adding that although schrempp 's contract runs until 2008 , he will only draw his salary until the end of the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche schrempp , 60 , will be replaced by dieter zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , who helped return the us-based chrysler division to profitability , the company said in a statement .
analyst jürgen pieper said zetsche 's appointment " will blow some fresh wind into daimlerchrysler . " apart from bringing in some much-needed dynamism , zetsche 's arrival is also expected to be a stabilizing factor . erich klemm , head of the workers ' council at daimlerchrysler indicated thursday that zetsche would honor the agreements hammered out between the management and the workers ' council and avoid layoffs linked to the company 's performance . zetsche will be replaced by thomas lasorda as chrysler 's leader , with the changes taking effect at the start of 2006 . the news of schrempp 's resignation came as the company reported improved second-quarter earnings and a slight rise in sales . schrempp 's history with daimlerchrysler stretches back over 44 years , during which he held a variety of management positions , including the leadership of daimler-benz operations in south africa , the united states and germany as well as 17 years as chairman of daimler-benz aerospace and daimlerchrysler . schrempp began his career with the company in 1961 as an apprentice mechanic and joined the company 's stuttgart headquarters in 1967 . dw staff -lrb- dc , sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo gets a bruising as expected , daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp got a verbal beating at the annual shareholder 's meeting on wednesday .

the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets . " we continue to warn the governments of denmark and italy and all crusader governments that they will receive the same punishment if they do not withdraw their troops from iraq and afghanistan , " read the statement , published on a web site popular with islamic militants , by a group calling itself the " secret organization of al qaeda in europe .

" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .
i do n't think the danger is that big , but we ca n't guarantee that somewhere in the city , there is n't a crazy person or group who are convinced they 're doing the right thing . " denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry .

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

italy , denmark up security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish police are out to calm a nervous public following the london bombings , italy and denmark were named as possible targets on a web site popular with islamic militants .
both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .
their presence on the city 's transport system is designed to deter potential bombers and calm public fears . security services all over denmark are working overtime to thwart those who would punish the country 's alliance with us president george w. bush , as well as what many immigrants regard as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's hostile right-wing government . further south , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has presented a 19-point anti-terror plan to the italian senate .
the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets . " we continue to warn the governments of denmark and italy and all crusader governments that they will receive the same punishment if they do not withdraw their troops from iraq and afghanistan , " read the statement , published on a web site popular with islamic militants , by a group calling itself the " secret organization of al qaeda in europe . "
it is the same group that claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings earlier this month on london 's transport network . italians fear imminent attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers patrol at the entrance of the central railway station in milan , italy , wednesday july 13 , 2005 .
" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .
i do n't think the danger is that big , but we ca n't guarantee that somewhere in the city , there is n't a crazy person or group who are convinced they 're doing the right thing . " denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry . " i am certain that al qaeda is operating in denmark , " yuksekkaya , who has conducted a study of every mosque in greater copenhagen , said .
" and i 'm convinced that their friends and relatives know what 's going on , but they 're turning a blind eye . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque in london .
such sentiments offend moderate danish muslims such as zahid butt , who runs a web site for pakistanis in denmark .
he regards yuksekkaya as a scare mongerer . " i ca n't recognize that picture at all , " butt said .
" if there is a problem within the muslim community , then most of the community will react , because the problem would mean that they and their families are also at risk .
it there is a threat in denmark , then i too am threatened .

italy , denmark up security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish police are out to calm a nervous public following the london bombings , italy and denmark were named as possible targets on a web site popular with islamic militants .
both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .
their presence on the city 's transport system is designed to deter potential bombers and calm public fears . security services all over denmark are working overtime to thwart those who would punish the country 's alliance with us president george w. bush , as well as what many immigrants regard as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's hostile right-wing government . further south , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has presented a 19-point anti-terror plan to the italian senate .
the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets . " we continue to warn the governments of denmark and italy and all crusader governments that they will receive the same punishment if they do not withdraw their troops from iraq and afghanistan , " read the statement , published on a web site popular with islamic militants , by a group calling itself the " secret organization of al qaeda in europe . "
it is the same group that claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings earlier this month on london 's transport network . italians fear imminent attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers patrol at the entrance of the central railway station in milan , italy , wednesday july 13 , 2005 .
" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .
i do n't think the danger is that big , but we ca n't guarantee that somewhere in the city , there is n't a crazy person or group who are convinced they 're doing the right thing . " denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry . " i am certain that al qaeda is operating in denmark , " yuksekkaya , who has conducted a study of every mosque in greater copenhagen , said .
" and i 'm convinced that their friends and relatives know what 's going on , but they 're turning a blind eye . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque in london .
such sentiments offend moderate danish muslims such as zahid butt , who runs a web site for pakistanis in denmark .
he regards yuksekkaya as a scare mongerer . " i ca n't recognize that picture at all , " butt said .
" if there is a problem within the muslim community , then most of the community will react , because the problem would mean that they and their families are also at risk .
it there is a threat in denmark , then i too am threatened .

"
a police officer at the scene was heard to shout to which came the reply : " why should i come out like that ? "
the police officer then shouted : " we need to check you have n't got explosives on you . " after an agonizing wait and repeated calls for the men to come out , the police made their move .
two short but loud explosions rang out across the suburban streets as stun grenades were fired into the houses .

" the anti-terrorism operation is still ongoing , and has been conducted in the context of close international collaboration . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.07.2005 the high cost of security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms invest increasingly in smart security like this iris scanner terrorism could pose a serious threat to world business , according to german trade group bga .
it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

"
a police officer at the scene was heard to shout to which came the reply : " why should i come out like that ? "
the police officer then shouted : " we need to check you have n't got explosives on you . " after an agonizing wait and repeated calls for the men to come out , the police made their move .
two short but loud explosions rang out across the suburban streets as stun grenades were fired into the houses .
a flurry of activity followed as armed officers stormed the buildings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some moments later , two officers in full forensic suits led a third man , also in full overalls , from the rear of the house to an unmarked car .
the suspect and officers then sped away to london 's high security paddington green police station .
another followed shortly after carrying the second suspect . three july 21 bombers caught in england if their identities and connections are confirmed , the two men will join somali-born yasin hassan omar in custody as three of the failed suicide bombers responsible for attempted attacks on july 21 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasin hassan omar omar , accused of trying to bomb an underground train at warrant street tube station , was arrested in a similar raid in birmingham , central england , on wednesday where he was disabled by a tazer stun gun before being driven to the capital for questioning . fourth suspect arrested in rome the fourth suspected bomber was later said to be in custody in rome , making it a very successful day for the investigation into the attempted july 21 bombings and the far deadlier july 7 attacks .
" the arrest took place a short while ago in rome of the somali , osman hussain , a naturalized british citizen , the fourth attacker in london on july 21 , " italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement .
" the anti-terrorism operation is still ongoing , and has been conducted in the context of close international collaboration . "
he gave no details about the arrest . the ansa news agency said hussain was seized by a special police anti-terrorist cell , the digos , from an apartment in the tor pignattara area on the periphery of the italian capital at about 14:30 uct .
he was then taken to rome police headquarters , the agency said . the four would-be london bombers mounted their abortive attacks exactly two weeks after four suspected islamist militants killed themselves and 52 other people in blasts on three underground trains and a bus in london . raids across city , arrests at liverpool street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as the raid in dalgarno gardens , police sealed off streets around notting hill , another part of west london , and mounted another raid , residents said .
and at liverpool street station , just on the eastern edge of the city center , armed police made yet more arrests , a spokesman for british transport police said .
a witness told afp he saw two women wearing islamic scarves pinned down by officers after they ran away when stopped for a routine check . police operations continue apace across the uk .
nine men were arrested by police in tooting , south london , on thursday , bringing the total number of people held under anti-terrorist laws over the london attacks to 20 . in other developments , haroon rashid aswad , a briton linked in media reports to an attempt to set up a militant training camp in the united states as well as being suspected of involvement in the july 7 london bombings , was arrested in zambia , according to interpol reports . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heart of europe vulnerable to terrorism brussels , the capital of europe , would be vulnerable to a terror attack on its public transport system and would be ill-prepared to deal with an incident on the scale of the london bombings , officials said on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.07.2005 the high cost of security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms invest increasingly in smart security like this iris scanner terrorism could pose a serious threat to world business , according to german trade group bga .
it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct . "
the president is " a man with whom you can speak very openly , " schäuble said . " i am pleased to have been received by such high-ranking people , " he said .
" this shows that the us government is interested in good relations with germany . " reviving relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush met angela merkel on a recent visit to mainz .
in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .
german foreign policy has to find a way back to a traditional balance between good relations with the us and france . " under schröder 's leadership , relations with the us soured when germany and france sided together in opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . summing up his discussion with the president , schäuble said he 'd made it clear that a future conservative government would n't do everything differently from the spd-green coalition , nor could the us expect that germany would always share its opinion .
what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.07.2005 the new face of daimlerchrysler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche , the new man at the daimlerchrylser helm stock markets reacted positively thursday to the news that jürgen schrempp is standing down after a decade in the top spot , and there are high hopes for his successor , dieter zetsche as well . zetsche and daimler embarked on their long-standing relationship back in the mid-1970s , when the turkish-born graduate joined the company after completing his studies in electro-technology at the university of karlsruhe . he began his long career in the research and development department , while simultaneously working on his doctorate in engineering at the technical university in the german town of padeborn .
he completed it in 1982 . just two years later , he became responsible for the coordination and development of utility vehicles abroad , a charge which led him to different managerial positions in brazil , argentina and the united states . daring to be different even in those early years , he won praise for being bold enough to change the traditional way of doing things within the company , notably for having development and production experts work together in a bid to cut development costs . it was a coup and one of the reasons for his appointment in 1995 to the management board from where he watched outgoing ceo jürgen schrempp merge mercedes benz with us automobile manufacturer chrysler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen schrempp news of the fusion was met with great excitement on both sides , but the euphoria was soon replaced with the realization that managing the two companies under one roof was going to be a tricky business . in essence , the two companies were too similar to really complement one another , and there was concern back at home that the merger would damage mercedes benz 's dominant market share .
with that in mind , schrempp did n't set about immediately transferring what was widely seen as its superior technology into the engines of chrysler vehicles . chrysler savior instead , in november 2000 , he transferred dieter zetsche , then 47-years-old and head of the company 's commercial vehicle business , to shake up daimler 's new partner which was sinking in a sea of its own red ink . part of the problem was that many of chrysler 's top executives had jumped ship right after the merger . some had grown rich on stock awards which were part of the fusion deal , while others could n't get used to taking orders from the headquarters in stuttgart .
at the time , a marketing expert called james holden was brought in to save the day . but the mess he inherited was too big to untangle . so the baton was passed to dieter zetsche , who waved it ruthlessly , slashing 26,000 jobs and closing six factories .
unsurprisingly , he quickly became the enemy new boy on the block . but the chrysler workers did n't dislike him for long .
wooed by what is often described as his caring attitude and easy manner , they took to him and his ways . yet beneath his smiling moustache , there is no doubt that zetsche can play tough and that he is not afraid to do so . successful turnaround in his five years as head of chrysler , he has proved his worth , and pulled the company up out of the doldrums .
in the second quarter of this year , the us company posted an operating profit gain of 4 percent to 544 million euros -lrb- $ 657 million -rrb- , which was above analysts ' estimates of 412 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failing smart is one of the reasons behind daimlerchryler 's problems now , zetsche has to work his magic back home where mercedes has been struggling to keep afloat against the strong euro and compensate for losses incurred through its smart mini-car brand .

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct . "
the president is " a man with whom you can speak very openly , " schäuble said . " i am pleased to have been received by such high-ranking people , " he said .
" this shows that the us government is interested in good relations with germany . " reviving relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush met angela merkel on a recent visit to mainz .
in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .
german foreign policy has to find a way back to a traditional balance between good relations with the us and france . " under schröder 's leadership , relations with the us soured when germany and france sided together in opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . summing up his discussion with the president , schäuble said he 'd made it clear that a future conservative government would n't do everything differently from the spd-green coalition , nor could the us expect that germany would always share its opinion .
what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than full membership .
aside from the state of us-german relations , other topics on the table included iran 's nuclear program .
schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .
merkel has already said she does not intend to deploy german soldiers there if she is elected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

italy , denmark up security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish police are out to calm a nervous public following the london bombings , italy and denmark were named as possible targets on a web site popular with islamic militants .
both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .
their presence on the city 's transport system is designed to deter potential bombers and calm public fears . security services all over denmark are working overtime to thwart those who would punish the country 's alliance with us president george w. bush , as well as what many immigrants regard as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's hostile right-wing government . further south , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has presented a 19-point anti-terror plan to the italian senate .
the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets .

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.07.2005 the high cost of security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms invest increasingly in smart security like this iris scanner terrorism could pose a serious threat to world business , according to german trade group bga .
it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct . "
the president is " a man with whom you can speak very openly , " schäuble said . " i am pleased to have been received by such high-ranking people , " he said .
" this shows that the us government is interested in good relations with germany . " reviving relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush met angela merkel on a recent visit to mainz .
in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .
german foreign policy has to find a way back to a traditional balance between good relations with the us and france . " under schröder 's leadership , relations with the us soured when germany and france sided together in opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . summing up his discussion with the president , schäuble said he 'd made it clear that a future conservative government would n't do everything differently from the spd-green coalition , nor could the us expect that germany would always share its opinion .
what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than full membership .
aside from the state of us-german relations , other topics on the table included iran 's nuclear program .
schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .
merkel has already said she does not intend to deploy german soldiers there if she is elected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?
wolfgang gerhardt , frontrunner for foreign minister under angela merkel , meets jack straw in london wednesday .
he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy .
-lrb- july 27 , 2005 -rrb- the world according to merkel what kind of germany will the world get if angel merkel becomes chancellor ?
most likely more of the same , say analysts .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- schröder to play the iraq card again ?
although the us-led iraq war no longer plays a prominent role in german political debate , there are indications that chancellor gerhard schröder may recycle the issue that brought him victory in 2002 .

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .
" those figures have been completely exceeded , " said bga spokesman andre schwarz . rising costs for germany as the world 's leading exporter , germany has a special interest in the costs of safeguarding its products when they are shipped abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the busy port of bremerhaven in northern germany for germany 's export-driven economy , the increasing cost of investing in anti-terrorism measures means an additional hike of 10 percent or some 10 million euros yearly .
" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct . "
the president is " a man with whom you can speak very openly , " schäuble said . " i am pleased to have been received by such high-ranking people , " he said .
" this shows that the us government is interested in good relations with germany . " reviving relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush met angela merkel on a recent visit to mainz .
in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .
german foreign policy has to find a way back to a traditional balance between good relations with the us and france . " under schröder 's leadership , relations with the us soured when germany and france sided together in opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . summing up his discussion with the president , schäuble said he 'd made it clear that a future conservative government would n't do everything differently from the spd-green coalition , nor could the us expect that germany would always share its opinion .
what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than full membership .
aside from the state of us-german relations , other topics on the table included iran 's nuclear program .
schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .
merkel has already said she does not intend to deploy german soldiers there if she is elected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

italy , denmark up security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish police are out to calm a nervous public following the london bombings , italy and denmark were named as possible targets on a web site popular with islamic militants .
both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .
their presence on the city 's transport system is designed to deter potential bombers and calm public fears . security services all over denmark are working overtime to thwart those who would punish the country 's alliance with us president george w. bush , as well as what many immigrants regard as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's hostile right-wing government . further south , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has presented a 19-point anti-terror plan to the italian senate .
the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets . " we continue to warn the governments of denmark and italy and all crusader governments that they will receive the same punishment if they do not withdraw their troops from iraq and afghanistan , " read the statement , published on a web site popular with islamic militants , by a group calling itself the " secret organization of al qaeda in europe .

" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .
i do n't think the danger is that big , but we ca n't guarantee that somewhere in the city , there is n't a crazy person or group who are convinced they 're doing the right thing . " denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry . " i am certain that al qaeda is operating in denmark , " yuksekkaya , who has conducted a study of every mosque in greater copenhagen , said .

such sentiments offend moderate danish muslims such as zahid butt , who runs a web site for pakistanis in denmark .

" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .

" denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry .

both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .
their presence on the city 's transport system is designed to deter potential bombers and calm public fears . security services all over denmark are working overtime to thwart those who would punish the country 's alliance with us president george w. bush , as well as what many immigrants regard as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's hostile right-wing government . further south , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has presented a 19-point anti-terror plan to the italian senate .
the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets .

jelena hoffmann , a parliamentarian and member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , filed the challenge to the country 's highest court .
another challenge will be submitted on monday by the green party parliamentarian werner schulz , his lawyer wolf-rüdiger schenke said .
the two are objecting to the reasons put forward by schröder to force a confidence vote which led to elections being called one year ahead of schedule .
schröder said he wanted early elections because he needed a new mandate to continue implementing a series of controversial reforms to the economy and the labor market , and claimed he had lost the support of his ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
hoffmann disputes this and accuses the chancellor of a dishonest approach .
most experts expect the constitutional court to reject the challenges and side with president horst köhler who ruled this month that the election could go-ahead because it was the best thing for germany and its struggling economy . www-links election 2005 read dw-world 's coverage of germany 's upcoming election more briefs 29.07.2005 -pipe- germany 's left remains east 's darling 29.07.2005 -pipe- heidi klum looking for a " supermodel " 28.07.2005 -pipe- germany to pay princess caroline damages 28.07.2005 -pipe- soccer chief : time to restrict foreigners 28.07.2005 -pipe- court rejects serbs ' bombing appeal 27.07.2005 -pipe- standing ovations for german tenor 27.07.2005 -pipe- ballack named german player of year 26.07.2005 -pipe- german state to honor dead aussie cyclist radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

jelena hoffmann , a parliamentarian and member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , filed the challenge to the country 's highest court .
another challenge will be submitted on monday by the green party parliamentarian werner schulz , his lawyer wolf-rüdiger schenke said .
the two are objecting to the reasons put forward by schröder to force a confidence vote which led to elections being called one year ahead of schedule .
schröder said he wanted early elections because he needed a new mandate to continue implementing a series of controversial reforms to the economy and the labor market , and claimed he had lost the support of his ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
hoffmann disputes this and accuses the chancellor of a dishonest approach .
most experts expect the constitutional court to reject the challenges and side with president horst köhler who ruled this month that the election could go-ahead because it was the best thing for germany and its struggling economy . www-links election 2005 read dw-world 's coverage of germany 's upcoming election more briefs 29.07.2005 -pipe- germany 's left remains east 's darling 29.07.2005 -pipe- heidi klum looking for a " supermodel " 28.07.2005 -pipe- germany to pay princess caroline damages 28.07.2005 -pipe- soccer chief : time to restrict foreigners 28.07.2005 -pipe- court rejects serbs ' bombing appeal 27.07.2005 -pipe- standing ovations for german tenor 27.07.2005 -pipe- ballack named german player of year 26.07.2005 -pipe- german state to honor dead aussie cyclist radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.07.2005 the new face of daimlerchrysler großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche , the new man at the daimlerchrylser helm stock markets reacted positively thursday to the news that jürgen schrempp is standing down after a decade in the top spot , and there are high hopes for his successor , dieter zetsche as well . zetsche and daimler embarked on their long-standing relationship back in the mid-1970s , when the turkish-born graduate joined the company after completing his studies in electro-technology at the university of karlsruhe . he began his long career in the research and development department , while simultaneously working on his doctorate in engineering at the technical university in the german town of padeborn .
he completed it in 1982 . just two years later , he became responsible for the coordination and development of utility vehicles abroad , a charge which led him to different managerial positions in brazil , argentina and the united states . daring to be different even in those early years , he won praise for being bold enough to change the traditional way of doing things within the company , notably for having development and production experts work together in a bid to cut development costs . it was a coup and one of the reasons for his appointment in 1995 to the management board from where he watched outgoing ceo jürgen schrempp merge mercedes benz with us automobile manufacturer chrysler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen schrempp news of the fusion was met with great excitement on both sides , but the euphoria was soon replaced with the realization that managing the two companies under one roof was going to be a tricky business . in essence , the two companies were too similar to really complement one another , and there was concern back at home that the merger would damage mercedes benz 's dominant market share .
with that in mind , schrempp did n't set about immediately transferring what was widely seen as its superior technology into the engines of chrysler vehicles . chrysler savior instead , in november 2000 , he transferred dieter zetsche , then 47-years-old and head of the company 's commercial vehicle business , to shake up daimler 's new partner which was sinking in a sea of its own red ink . part of the problem was that many of chrysler 's top executives had jumped ship right after the merger . some had grown rich on stock awards which were part of the fusion deal , while others could n't get used to taking orders from the headquarters in stuttgart .
at the time , a marketing expert called james holden was brought in to save the day . but the mess he inherited was too big to untangle . so the baton was passed to dieter zetsche , who waved it ruthlessly , slashing 26,000 jobs and closing six factories .
unsurprisingly , he quickly became the enemy new boy on the block . but the chrysler workers did n't dislike him for long .
wooed by what is often described as his caring attitude and easy manner , they took to him and his ways . yet beneath his smiling moustache , there is no doubt that zetsche can play tough and that he is not afraid to do so . successful turnaround in his five years as head of chrysler , he has proved his worth , and pulled the company up out of the doldrums .
in the second quarter of this year , the us company posted an operating profit gain of 4 percent to 544 million euros -lrb- $ 657 million -rrb- , which was above analysts ' estimates of 412 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failing smart is one of the reasons behind daimlerchryler 's problems now , zetsche has to work his magic back home where mercedes has been struggling to keep afloat against the strong euro and compensate for losses incurred through its smart mini-car brand .

italy , denmark up security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish police are out to calm a nervous public following the london bombings , italy and denmark were named as possible targets on a web site popular with islamic militants .
both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . on every platform of every station in copenhagen 's ultra modern metro system , police officers scrutinize passengers .
their presence on the city 's transport system is designed to deter potential bombers and calm public fears . security services all over denmark are working overtime to thwart those who would punish the country 's alliance with us president george w. bush , as well as what many immigrants regard as danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's hostile right-wing government . further south , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has presented a 19-point anti-terror plan to the italian senate .
the plan foresees the speedier deportation of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism , closer surveillance of telephone and internet traffic , wider powers for the police when carrying out raids , and compulsory submission of hair and saliva samples for dna testing . clearly , neither country wants to leave anything to chance following the release of a document in the aftermath of the london bombings that specifically named the two us allies as potential terrorist targets . " we continue to warn the governments of denmark and italy and all crusader governments that they will receive the same punishment if they do not withdraw their troops from iraq and afghanistan , " read the statement , published on a web site popular with islamic militants , by a group calling itself the " secret organization of al qaeda in europe . "
it is the same group that claimed responsibility for the deadly bombings earlier this month on london 's transport network . italians fear imminent attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers patrol at the entrance of the central railway station in milan , italy , wednesday july 13 , 2005 .
" the -lrb- italian -rrb- government is trying to strengthen the intelligence , to control some specific muslim communities , to control the kind of teaching that is produced by some muslim schools , and to be more attentive to signals that might come from other secret services in europe and elsewhere , " said italian terrorism analyst gianfranco pasquino . most people in italy fear that the country is at risk from an imminent terrorist attack .
one survey completed this week said 85 percent of people thought an attack was likely in the coming weeks or months .
people are modifying their habits , their movements and their holiday plans .
but pasquino says most italians are realistic about the level of protection they can expect from their government . " there those who believe the government is doing what it can , but many italians believe the government is n't particularly well equipped .
there are those who believe in a resigned way that there is not very much you can do about terrorism , " pasquino said . danish muslims concerned denmark 's police commander , per larsen , says that while the threat of terror is present , he is concerned with keeping public hysteria at minimum . " we have to look at what 's happened in other countries and be very aware that the risk is always there .
on the other hand , we still think denmark is a very peaceful country , " larsen said .
" it 's important not to make the whole situation too hysterical .
i do n't think the danger is that big , but we ca n't guarantee that somewhere in the city , there is n't a crazy person or group who are convinced they 're doing the right thing . " denmark has been immune from international terrorism for the past 20 years , but according to immigration consultant mehmet yuksekkaya , the country does have reason to worry . " i am certain that al qaeda is operating in denmark , " yuksekkaya , who has conducted a study of every mosque in greater copenhagen , said .
" and i 'm convinced that their friends and relatives know what 's going on , but they 're turning a blind eye . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims perform their traditional friday prayers in regent 's park mosque in london .
such sentiments offend moderate danish muslims such as zahid butt , who runs a web site for pakistanis in denmark .
he regards yuksekkaya as a scare mongerer . " i ca n't recognize that picture at all , " butt said .
" if there is a problem within the muslim community , then most of the community will react , because the problem would mean that they and their families are also at risk .

" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other .

" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

"
a police officer at the scene was heard to shout to which came the reply : " why should i come out like that ? "
the police officer then shouted : " we need to check you have n't got explosives on you . " after an agonizing wait and repeated calls for the men to come out , the police made their move .
two short but loud explosions rang out across the suburban streets as stun grenades were fired into the houses .
a flurry of activity followed as armed officers stormed the buildings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some moments later , two officers in full forensic suits led a third man , also in full overalls , from the rear of the house to an unmarked car .
the suspect and officers then sped away to london 's high security paddington green police station .
another followed shortly after carrying the second suspect . three july 21 bombers caught in england if their identities and connections are confirmed , the two men will join somali-born yasin hassan omar in custody as three of the failed suicide bombers responsible for attempted attacks on july 21 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasin hassan omar omar , accused of trying to bomb an underground train at warrant street tube station , was arrested in a similar raid in birmingham , central england , on wednesday where he was disabled by a tazer stun gun before being driven to the capital for questioning . fourth suspect arrested in rome the fourth suspected bomber was later said to be in custody in rome , making it a very successful day for the investigation into the attempted july 21 bombings and the far deadlier july 7 attacks .
" the arrest took place a short while ago in rome of the somali , osman hussain , a naturalized british citizen , the fourth attacker in london on july 21 , " italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement .
" the anti-terrorism operation is still ongoing , and has been conducted in the context of close international collaboration . "
he gave no details about the arrest . the ansa news agency said hussain was seized by a special police anti-terrorist cell , the digos , from an apartment in the tor pignattara area on the periphery of the italian capital at about 14:30 uct .
he was then taken to rome police headquarters , the agency said . the four would-be london bombers mounted their abortive attacks exactly two weeks after four suspected islamist militants killed themselves and 52 other people in blasts on three underground trains and a bus in london . raids across city , arrests at liverpool street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as the raid in dalgarno gardens , police sealed off streets around notting hill , another part of west london , and mounted another raid , residents said .
and at liverpool street station , just on the eastern edge of the city center , armed police made yet more arrests , a spokesman for british transport police said .
a witness told afp he saw two women wearing islamic scarves pinned down by officers after they ran away when stopped for a routine check . police operations continue apace across the uk .
nine men were arrested by police in tooting , south london , on thursday , bringing the total number of people held under anti-terrorist laws over the london attacks to 20 . in other developments , haroon rashid aswad , a briton linked in media reports to an attempt to set up a militant training camp in the united states as well as being suspected of involvement in the july 7 london bombings , was arrested in zambia , according to interpol reports . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heart of europe vulnerable to terrorism brussels , the capital of europe , would be vulnerable to a terror attack on its public transport system and would be ill-prepared to deal with an incident on the scale of the london bombings , officials said on tuesday .
-lrb- july 27 , 2005 -rrb- the next targets ?
italy , denmark up security following the london bombings , italy and denmark were named as possible targets on a web site popular with islamic militants .
both countries are now stepping up measures to protect against a similar attack . -lrb- july 29 , 2005 -rrb- more coordinated blasts shake london four bombs on london 's subways and a bus wounded at least one person thursday afternoon and sparked panic in london again as the city mourned the dozens that died after four bombs exploded two weeks ago .

while there is no specific threat , italy has swung into action to prevent a possible atrocity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.07.2005 all four london bombing suspects arrested großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed police carried out a number of raids across london on friday in extraordinary scenes in both london and rome , police investigating the attempted bombings in london on july 21 arrested all four suspected would-be suicide bombers who failed to repeat the atrocities of july 7 . london has sadly become accustomed to scenes of high drama in recent weeks and the events in a west london suburb and in other areas across the capital on friday added yet more chapters to a story of tragedy and suspense that has horrified and gripped the nation and the rest of the world . at around 11:00 utc , armed police surrounded two houses in dalgarno gardens , a run-down estate of public housing apartments in the white city area , before firing tear-gas canisters and apparently throwing stun grenades into the houses where two of the four suspected july 21 bombers were suspected of being holed up . the raid took place a few hundred meters from where a fifth bomb was found abandoned in bushes two days after the failed attacks . as startled residents ran for safety , some not even given enough time to get dressed , police surrounding the properties shouted instructions to the men - thought at the time to be eritrean-born hackney bus bomber muktar mohammed said , also known as muktar said ibrahim - and another unnamed suspect . police arrest suspect " mohammed " " mohammed , come out with -lrb- only -rrb- your underwear on and your hands up . "
a police officer at the scene was heard to shout to which came the reply : " why should i come out like that ? "
the police officer then shouted : " we need to check you have n't got explosives on you . " after an agonizing wait and repeated calls for the men to come out , the police made their move .
two short but loud explosions rang out across the suburban streets as stun grenades were fired into the houses .
a flurry of activity followed as armed officers stormed the buildings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some moments later , two officers in full forensic suits led a third man , also in full overalls , from the rear of the house to an unmarked car .
the suspect and officers then sped away to london 's high security paddington green police station .
another followed shortly after carrying the second suspect . three july 21 bombers caught in england if their identities and connections are confirmed , the two men will join somali-born yasin hassan omar in custody as three of the failed suicide bombers responsible for attempted attacks on july 21 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yasin hassan omar omar , accused of trying to bomb an underground train at warrant street tube station , was arrested in a similar raid in birmingham , central england , on wednesday where he was disabled by a tazer stun gun before being driven to the capital for questioning . fourth suspect arrested in rome the fourth suspected bomber was later said to be in custody in rome , making it a very successful day for the investigation into the attempted july 21 bombings and the far deadlier july 7 attacks .
" the arrest took place a short while ago in rome of the somali , osman hussain , a naturalized british citizen , the fourth attacker in london on july 21 , " italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu said in a statement .
" the anti-terrorism operation is still ongoing , and has been conducted in the context of close international collaboration . "
he gave no details about the arrest . the ansa news agency said hussain was seized by a special police anti-terrorist cell , the digos , from an apartment in the tor pignattara area on the periphery of the italian capital at about 14:30 uct .
he was then taken to rome police headquarters , the agency said . the four would-be london bombers mounted their abortive attacks exactly two weeks after four suspected islamist militants killed themselves and 52 other people in blasts on three underground trains and a bus in london . raids across city , arrests at liverpool street bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as the raid in dalgarno gardens , police sealed off streets around notting hill , another part of west london , and mounted another raid , residents said .
and at liverpool street station , just on the eastern edge of the city center , armed police made yet more arrests , a spokesman for british transport police said .
a witness told afp he saw two women wearing islamic scarves pinned down by officers after they ran away when stopped for a routine check . police operations continue apace across the uk .
nine men were arrested by police in tooting , south london , on thursday , bringing the total number of people held under anti-terrorist laws over the london attacks to 20 . in other developments , haroon rashid aswad , a briton linked in media reports to an attempt to set up a militant training camp in the united states as well as being suspected of involvement in the july 7 london bombings , was arrested in zambia , according to interpol reports . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heart of europe vulnerable to terrorism brussels , the capital of europe , would be vulnerable to a terror attack on its public transport system and would be ill-prepared to deal with an incident on the scale of the london bombings , officials said on tuesday .

it wants international security standards and better cooperation to prevent germany 's export locomotive from stalling . world business has long had to grapple with the damaging consequences of terrorism by investing in expensive security measures , personnel and technology .
following this month 's bombings of underground trains and a bus in london , those costs could shoot up even further , according to the german federation for foreign trade -lrb- bga -rrb- . in berlin on on thursday , the group published a report in which they estimate that worldwide foreign trade spends about 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- yearly on anti-terrorism measures - a figure it expects will double over the next few years .
" we have to reckon with the fact that terrorism will increase , " bga president anton börner said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burning twin towers shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the us , the oecd predicted that additional security measures would cost a maximum of 3 percent of the total value of all internationally traded wares - around 14 billion euros .

" the increasing costs affect all , " börner said , adding that small and medium-sized firms are especially hard-hit as they have to pay for the installation of computer systems to handle customs formalities . the bga pointed out that the rising cost of preventing terrorism is especially reflected in increased security fees at german airports , which doubled between the years 2000 and 2004 and amounted to 310 million euros in 2004 . at the same time börner underlined that terrorism would n't inflict lasting damage on the world economy .
" i do n't believe that the terrorists will manage to put a brake - even fleetingly - on the world economy 's dynamism , " börner said . the price of security the bga 's report on terrorism 's detrimental impact on world business highlights the dilemma that foreign trade and industry often find themselves in when it comes to terrorism prevention .
on the one hand , export-led businesses are eager to implement security measures since they see securing transport routes for the movement of goods as having the highest priority .
but on the other hand , exaggerated and highly-expensive preventive measures often cost companies loads of time and money in dealing with the ensuing bureaucracy . " security has its price , " said börner .
" but it should n't lead to unreasonable financial and administrative burdens … it is always a question of finding the right balance between security demands on one side and the legitimate interests of trade on the other . " eu anti-terror rules under fire the bga criticized in particular " exaggerated and costly security measures which add no extra security to the flow of international trade " and pointed to the less-than-perfect security cooperation between european member states in their fight against terror . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group also warned that the differing degrees and speeds with which eu member states implement security plans agreed on by the bloc could distort competition .
" to this date , a balance between security needs and economic reality is hardly recognizable in the so-called anti-terror directives of the eu , " said börner . at the same time , the report emphasized that the solution could n't lie in go-it-alone security initiatives by individual governments , but rather in international security standards , adding that the german economy needed sensible and practical regulations which could prove as a point of orientation . a silver lining börner said , however , that german companies were often the first to implement security measures , causing them to suffer - in contrast to their less eager foreign competitors - each time new measures were introduced . but , by the same logic , there was also a bright spot in the bga 's bleak report : " german firms are very strong when it comes to security technology .

analyst jürgen pieper said zetsche 's appointment " will blow some fresh wind into daimlerchrysler .

but , in a sign that washington is interested in improving us-german relations should the conservatives sweep september 's election as many predict , schäuble got the red carpet treatment - an unscheduled 45-minute meeting with president george w. bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice . speaking at a press conference in hamburg on his return , schäuble described the atmosphere at the meeting as " very direct . "
the president is " a man with whom you can speak very openly , " schäuble said . " i am pleased to have been received by such high-ranking people , " he said .
" this shows that the us government is interested in good relations with germany . " reviving relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush met angela merkel on a recent visit to mainz .
in a jab at chancellor schröder 's government , schäuble said that a future cdu government would not sacrifice good transatlantic relations to improve those with other european countries . " it is not a question of building a counterweight to america .
german foreign policy has to find a way back to a traditional balance between good relations with the us and france . " under schröder 's leadership , relations with the us soured when germany and france sided together in opposition to the us-led invasion of iraq . summing up his discussion with the president , schäuble said he 'd made it clear that a future conservative government would n't do everything differently from the spd-green coalition , nor could the us expect that germany would always share its opinion .
what he could promise , he said , was that the conservatives would reintroduce a " climate of trust " between washington and berlin . white house officials were reluctant to qualify the unscheduled meeting as the beginning of a new us-german alliance . " we are moving forward since our difficulties of the past and will continue to do so regardless of who wins the german elections , " a spokesman said . iran , turkey on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than full membership .
aside from the state of us-german relations , other topics on the table included iran 's nuclear program .
schäuble said the president assured the europeans of continued support from the us in their negotiations with tehran . there was a difference of opinion on turkey 's prospective membership in the eu , however , as schäuble made clear that merkel 's party remains opposed to full membership , preferring instead to pursue a " privileged partnership " - something that is " not quite the position of washington . "
the us has said it would like to see turkey become a member of the eu . fortunately for schäuble , the issue of iraq did not arise .
merkel has already said she does not intend to deploy german soldiers there if she is elected . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

he completed it in 1982 . just two years later , he became responsible for the coordination and development of utility vehicles abroad , a charge which led him to different managerial positions in brazil , argentina and the united states . daring to be different even in those early years , he won praise for being bold enough to change the traditional way of doing things within the company , notably for having development and production experts work together in a bid to cut development costs . it was a coup and one of the reasons for his appointment in 1995 to the management board from where he watched outgoing ceo jürgen schrempp merge mercedes benz with us automobile manufacturer chrysler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen schrempp news of the fusion was met with great excitement on both sides , but the euphoria was soon replaced with the realization that managing the two companies under one roof was going to be a tricky business . in essence , the two companies were too similar to really complement one another , and there was concern back at home that the merger would damage mercedes benz 's dominant market share .
with that in mind , schrempp did n't set about immediately transferring what was widely seen as its superior technology into the engines of chrysler vehicles . chrysler savior instead , in november 2000 , he transferred dieter zetsche , then 47-years-old and head of the company 's commercial vehicle business , to shake up daimler 's new partner which was sinking in a sea of its own red ink . part of the problem was that many of chrysler 's top executives had jumped ship right after the merger . some had grown rich on stock awards which were part of the fusion deal , while others could n't get used to taking orders from the headquarters in stuttgart .
at the time , a marketing expert called james holden was brought in to save the day . but the mess he inherited was too big to untangle . so the baton was passed to dieter zetsche , who waved it ruthlessly , slashing 26,000 jobs and closing six factories .
unsurprisingly , he quickly became the enemy new boy on the block . but the chrysler workers did n't dislike him for long .
wooed by what is often described as his caring attitude and easy manner , they took to him and his ways . yet beneath his smiling moustache , there is no doubt that zetsche can play tough and that he is not afraid to do so . successful turnaround in his five years as head of chrysler , he has proved his worth , and pulled the company up out of the doldrums .
in the second quarter of this year , the us company posted an operating profit gain of 4 percent to 544 million euros -lrb- $ 657 million -rrb- , which was above analysts ' estimates of 412 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failing smart is one of the reasons behind daimlerchryler 's problems now , zetsche has to work his magic back home where mercedes has been struggling to keep afloat against the strong euro and compensate for losses incurred through its smart mini-car brand .
he takes over as the new ceo of daimlerchrysler on january 1 , 2006 . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler ceo gets a bruising as expected , daimlerchrysler ceo jürgen schrempp got a verbal beating at the annual shareholder 's meeting on wednesday .

in the past year the town has seen the biggest jump in property values in the uk .
prices have climbed by 44 % , from an average of less than £ 70,000 to just over £ 100,000 .
a former new town , irvine has seen its fair share of economic problems , but , like its new town roundabouts , it seems to be coming round again .
but just what makes it so hot ?
i went out onto the town 's streets to ask some of the locals what it was like to live in irvine , but no-one seemed keen to tell me .
perhaps they were rushing home to calculate just how much their bricks and mortar had increased in value ? "
it 's a fantastic part of the country " brian macdonald north ayrshire council perhaps they were rushing off to the scottish maritime museum , or the massive magnum leisure centre ?
or perhaps they wanted to keep historic gems , such as the restored cobbled streets of the glasgow vennel , a secret ?
in any case , value for money is clearly a factor in irvine 's turnaround .
this has been helped by improved communications , making it more attractive to buyers wanting to commute to nearby towns or north to glasgow .
tim crawford , an economist for bank of scotland who carried out the price survey , said the best performing towns in recent years had all made jumps in the magnitude of 30 % to 40 % .
he explained : " quite often it is a sign of a ripple effect from cities , buyers are looking further afield for places with good commuter links , increasing the demand among first time buyers .
" with irvine it 's a combination of general trends , a degree of regeneration and good road and rail links . "
there has been a settlement on the coast at irvine for centuries and it was once a centre for shipping coal , making it one of the most important ports in scotland .
a decline in coal production in the 1930s continued through until the eventual closure of the ayrshire coalfields .
regeneration plans the new town designation gave irvine a boost but it has been hit by setbacks like the closure of the volvo factory in the 1980s and the winding up of the landmark millennium project big idea science centre .
brian macdonald , the assistant chief executive of north ayrshire council , said the loss of the big idea was a blow .
but he is convinced the bounce in house prices can be a springboard to greater things , marking the town out as no longer a backwater .
he said : " irvine is an area which has had a few ups and downs and it 's something the council is concerned about , that we have to do more to regenerate the economy . "
we 're finding there 's a lot of commuter clients now , people moving from troon , prestwick , even the south side of glasgow " aileen mclaws allen and harris " we 're currently working with scottish enterprise and a number of other partners to build a case to present to the scottish executive for creating an urban regeneration company in the bay area .
" against that background , people are recognising it 's a fantastic part of the country , access is good and people are realising that there 's a housing mix that perhaps was n't there before . "
mr macdonald said it was good to see people identifying irvine as a place to live , as well as being encouraging for home-owners to see a return on their investment .
aileen mclaws , branch partner of estate agents allen and harris , said such a large increase in house prices did create a feelgood factor .
but she cautioned that it was only a levelling out for the town in relation to other locations .
she said : " it 's affected only certain price ranges , the bottom price range of the market .
" for first time buyers , unfortunately they 're struggling to get onto the property ladder because the prices have increased .
" we 're finding there 's a lot of commuter clients now , people moving from troon , prestwick , even the south side of glasgow - even though the house prices have gone up they are still cheaper . "
irvine no more ?
she said that irvine was essentially a family town which had seen the construction of a lot of quality housing over past years , not just in the town centre , but creating nicer outlying areas .
the council 's regeneration plans could mark out continued prosperity .
the authority is currently waiting for ministerial approval for creating the irvine bay regeneration company , to develop a variety of projects extending from ardrossan to irvine .
the £ 10m proposals are aimed at providing a focus for employment , reviving urban areas in decline and achieving a " prosperous , healthy north ayrshire " .
in letter from america , the proclaimers once sang " irvine no more " , in the not too distant future it may be a case of " irvine again " .

in the past year the town has seen the biggest jump in property values in the uk .
irvine harbourside has already seen housing regeneration prices have climbed by 44 % , from an average of less than £ 70,000 to just over £ 100,000 .
a former new town , irvine has seen its fair share of economic problems , but , like its new town roundabouts , it seems to be coming round again .
but just what makes it so hot ?
i went out onto the town 's streets to ask some of the locals what it was like to live in irvine , but no-one seemed keen to tell me .
perhaps they were rushing home to calculate just how much their bricks and mortar had increased in value ?
it 's a fantastic part of the country brian macdonald north ayrshire council perhaps they were rushing off to the scottish maritime museum , or the massive magnum leisure centre ?
or perhaps they wanted to keep historic gems , such as the restored cobbled streets of the glasgow vennel , a secret ?
in any case , value for money is clearly a factor in irvine 's turnaround .
this has been helped by improved communications , making it more attractive to buyers wanting to commute to nearby towns or north to glasgow .
tim crawford , an economist for bank of scotland who carried out the price survey , said the best performing towns in recent years had all made jumps in the magnitude of 30 % to 40 % .
robert burns is one previous resident of the glasgow vennel he explained : " quite often it is a sign of a ripple effect from cities , buyers are looking further afield for places with good commuter links , increasing the demand among first time buyers .
" with irvine it 's a combination of general trends , a degree of regeneration and good road and rail links . "
there has been a settlement on the coast at irvine for centuries and it was once a centre for shipping coal , making it one of the most important ports in scotland .
a decline in coal production in the 1930s continued through until the eventual closure of the ayrshire coalfields .
regeneration plans the new town designation gave irvine a boost but it has been hit by setbacks like the closure of the volvo factory in the 1980s and the winding up of the landmark millennium project big idea science centre .
brian macdonald , the assistant chief executive of north ayrshire council , said the loss of the big idea was a blow .
but he is convinced the bounce in house prices can be a springboard to greater things , marking the town out as no longer a backwater .
he said : " irvine is an area which has had a few ups and downs and it 's something the council is concerned about , that we have to do more to regenerate the economy .
we 're finding there 's a lot of commuter clients now , people moving from troon , prestwick , even the south side of glasgow aileen mclaws allen and harris " we 're currently working with scottish enterprise and a number of other partners to build a case to present to the scottish executive for creating an urban regeneration company in the bay area .
" against that background , people are recognising it 's a fantastic part of the country , access is good and people are realising that there 's a housing mix that perhaps was n't there before . "
mr macdonald said it was good to see people identifying irvine as a place to live , as well as being encouraging for home-owners to see a return on their investment .
aileen mclaws , branch partner of estate agents allen and harris , said such a large increase in house prices did create a feelgood factor .
a seafaring past is reflected in the scottish maritime museum but she cautioned that it was only a levelling out for the town in relation to other locations .
she said : " it 's affected only certain price ranges , the bottom price range of the market .
" for first time buyers , unfortunately they 're struggling to get onto the property ladder because the prices have increased .
" we 're finding there 's a lot of commuter clients now , people moving from troon , prestwick , even the south side of glasgow - even though the house prices have gone up they are still cheaper . "
irvine no more ?
she said that irvine was essentially a family town which had seen the construction of a lot of quality housing over past years , not just in the town centre , but creating nicer outlying areas .
the council 's regeneration plans could mark out continued prosperity .
the authority is currently waiting for ministerial approval for creating the irvine bay regeneration company , to develop a variety of projects extending from ardrossan to irvine .
the £ 10m proposals are aimed at providing a focus for employment , reviving urban areas in decline and achieving a " prosperous , healthy north ayrshire " .
in letter from america , the proclaimers once sang " irvine no more " , in the not too distant future it may be a case of " irvine again " .

in the current climate of unease after recent terror attacks in europe and beyond , many see the timing as no coincidence .
europe 's ' last colony ' under the headline " ira lays down weapons " , france 's le figaro says thursday 's announcement " should put an end to more than three decades of violence " .
" while the organisation has observed a ceasefire since 1997 , this new initiative officially puts an end to any form of violence and should entail the decommissioning of the entire paramilitary apparatus , " the paper says .
poland 's gazeta wyborcza hails what it calls " this historic statement " which heralds " renewed efforts to establish self-rule in ulster " in a bid to end what the paper calls " british rule " in " modern-day europe 's last colony " .
according to germany 's der tagesspiegel , the ira statement lives up to high expectations .
the paper acknowledges that the ira did not say much about its victims , but it argues that the organisation had little choice .
the real test will lie in unconditional support for northern ireland 's police der tagesspiegel " if it had offered a remorseful apology to its victims , as would be appropriate , it would have called its own legitimacy into question , " the paper observes .
this , it continues , could have led radicals to break away from the group , something which " can not be in anyone 's interest at the moment " .
the paper believes that what matters now is the ira 's long-term intentions .
" in the end the real test will lie not in rusty weapons , but in sinn fein and this new veterans ' association called the ira showing unconditional support for northern ireland 's police , " it says .
' damaged beyond repair ' spain 's el pais observes that it took " decades of suffering " for the ira to reach its decision .
along the way , the paper says , " several thousand lives have been cut down by terrorism ... and generations marked by hatred " .
it feels that the ira 's image has become damaged beyond repair by the belfast northern bank robbery and the murder of popular belfast man robert mccartney earlier in the year .
it takes two to make peace liberation " these recent events ... cost it , permanently , the crucial support of a sector of american politics , " the paper believes .
it now hopes to see negotiations leading to a lasting political agreement for northern ireland , adding that " london will have to contribute to this goal measures announced many times but never implemented " .
the paper adds that the ira 's decision frees up britain 's security forces at a crucial time " to fight full strength against islamist terror , a threat which is much less predictable and much harder to deal with " .
' drift to political crime ' france 's liberation says the ball is now in the court of what the paper describes as " ultra-loyalist " forces in northern ireland .
the paper acknowledges the magnitude of the step taken by the ira by noting that " it is never a simple formality " to say " the war is over " .
it warns however , that " it takes two to make peace " .
" while it is true that the ira and the most militarised sections of the republican movement have not always shown great skilfulness or openness since the announcement of their ceasefire , " the paper says , " their ultra-loyalist counterparts have seized on every pretext to engage in obstruction . "
" today the ball is in their court , " it says , although the ira will have to fulfil its pledge on weapons and , as far as possible , put an end to what the paper calls " the drift from the ' armed struggle ' to political crime " .
the ira failed to achieve its goal through violence ; instead it united ireland in hostility to terror pravda spain 's abc says the ira 's move now leaves the basque separatist organisation eta as " the only terrorist group in europe " .
the paper feels the ira can make a decisive contribution to the success of the peace process by what it calls " the effective dismantling of the terrorist organisation 's arsenals " .
but it warns that even when they announce that they are stopping the violence , terrorists " remain terrorists " .
germany 's frankfurter rundschau cautiously welcomes the ira statement .
the paper says the group deserves praise " until there is evidence to the contrary " .
it believes that the timing of the announcement is no accident because the london attacks had put pressure on the ira as well as british prime minister tony blair .
sense of urgency according to the paper , " the london bombs made it clear that the republican movement had to distance itself from violence emphatically in order to survive " .
slovakia 's pravda agrees .
under the headline " terrorists made ira turn away from violence " , the paper argues that the attacks in new york , madrid and london had a profound impact .
" any support for the ira using violence to achieve its goals has disappeared , " it says .
the paper feels that the ira leadership 's call on its members to give up their arms is something " unimaginable just a few years ago " .
" the ira failed to achieve its goal through violence ; instead it united ireland in hostility to terror , " it says .
switzerland 's le temps says the london bombings created a greater sense of urgency for the ira to act .
" perhaps the ira is hoping to regain some sort of respectability , " the paper suggests , since " the horror to which islamist terrorism is giving rise today may lead people to forget its own bloody actions " .
according to the paper , the ira 's choice also shows that conflicts are not necessarily irresolvable .
it acknowledges that the good friday agreement on power-sharing was followed by a " very chaotic " process , but it adds that " it is this fragile method whose effect can be seen today " .
as the paper puts it , " a spiral of peace is being established in northern ireland " .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

" it 's reassuring that police are urging people to report even verbal abuse because if that can be tackled it will safeguard us from violent attacks .

the city council is submitting its application for the money to the department for transport on friday .
one of the council 's " transport priorities " is a fast , limited-stop service along the seafront .
it would connect the city centre with the king alfred sites in the west and brighton marina in the east , with links to other transport interchanges .
a direct service to the royal sussex county hospital is also proposed .
park and ride councillor gill mitchell , chair of the council 's environment committee , said the rapid transport scheme would " encourage less car journeys , give people increased travel choice and help us fight congestion and pollution " .
the council said its bid involved " hybrid electric vehicles " which are fuel efficient and have low emissions .
if it is successful the money would be spent on initial start-up and operating costs .
funding is also being sought for a potential park and ride site to link the service with the north of the city .
" -lsb- it would -rsb- provide swift journeys into the city centre for those visiting or travelling to work from outlying areas , " said ms mitchell .

the city council is submitting its application for the money to the department for transport on friday .
one of the council 's " transport priorities " is a fast , limited-stop service along the seafront .
it would connect the city centre with the king alfred sites in the west and brighton marina in the east , with links to other transport interchanges .
a direct service to the royal sussex county hospital is also proposed .
park and ride councillor gill mitchell , chair of the council 's environment committee , said the rapid transport scheme would " encourage less car journeys , give people increased travel choice and help us fight congestion and pollution " .
the council said its bid involved " hybrid electric vehicles " which are fuel efficient and have low emissions .
if it is successful the money would be spent on initial start-up and operating costs .
funding is also being sought for a potential park and ride site to link the service with the north of the city .
" -lsb- it would -rsb- provide swift journeys into the city centre for those visiting or travelling to work from outlying areas , " said ms mitchell .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- are hospital standards falling ?
bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 29 july 2005 , 08:02 gmt 09:02 uk are hospital standards falling ?
this year fewer hospitals in england have received three stars - the top rating - in the health commission 's annual survey .
it 's the first time standards have fallen in four years .
problems with finances and government targets are being blamed .
but primary care , mental health and the ambulance trust have improved , according to the nhs watchdog .
nhs star ratings are to be scrapped - from next year , trusts will be asked to produce annual self-assessments and there will random spot checks on trusts with problems .
what is your experience of nhs hospitals ?
is the star rating system fair ?
what can be done to improve hospitals ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by alison , uk " hospitals are allegedly failing to reach certain targets and have , therefore , lost " stars " .
should the government stop setting targets and allow the hospitals to have more autonomy to improve patient care ? "
i think the nhs needs to stop appointing nurses and medical staff to managerial positions .
nursing staff are very good at nursing but they are not trained to manage a business .
properly trained managerial staff would be able to manage the business of running a hospital and control the finances .
there are far too many managers in the nhs and by employing a few less managers , and more front line staff then they will be able to do the jobs that actually help hospitals to run every day lucy , uk if people were cans of beans and we all were in supermarkets then i could understand the star rating system because everyone would be the same .
however we are not .
the star rating system is a simplistic and meaningless way of assessing services , just like school league tables .
they are there for the consumption of ' middle england ' and the sound bite politics and journalism we are fed through the media .
here in stoke we have a fantastic hospital with dedicated and hardworking professionals who are doing more with fewer resources and as their rating has fallen they will be in line for yet another rubbishing by the media .
all i want to say is well done you are all stars ...
10 stars that is .
robert fair , staffs having just received treatment for a mild heart attack in fairfield general hospital , bury .
i have nothing but praise for the team in coronary care unit .
i am not surprised that some hospitals are suffering because these days there are too many chiefs in the nhs .
maybe if the cut back on all the unnecessary departments and got back to basics the nhs would be in a better state .
i work within the nhs for a supplier and i know the hassle the staff have to go through to sometimes get basic equipment .
w shepherd , bolton i think that the nhs needs to pay more attention to their management .
managers within the nhs appear to be promoted through their ranks and lack basic management skills .
this results in a waste of resources , money and mismanagement of staff , particularly at the lower grades .
doug powell , london " the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients " anon , uk the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients .
i would always prefer to wait and see a doctor who actually is an expert than see an inferior / failed doctor instantly i walk into a hospital .
i work in a zero rated university teaching hospital but my department has an international reputation for excellence .
everyone who works in the nhs knows that these rating schemes never measure the things that really matter but are management games .
anon , uk i have been in and out of hospital quite a few times over the last three years and i have had nothing but wonderful service from paramedics , doctors , nurses , and staff less recognised like cleaners .
they have all given me a high standard of care , been incredibly compassionate and kind , and made me feel a whole less frightened by the whole experience .
there is too much talk of low ' star ' service , so i want to take this time to thank all those in the nhs service for everything they have done for me and my loved ones .
you do a great job , guys !
nicole , london i think the nhs is appalling .
i went in to have a lymph node removed and tested last year and came out with a terrible hip infection after i had been operated on .
the lymph node came back clear but i left hospital sicker than when i went in .
sharon , london the national health service is outdated and obsolete .
the limited government resources need to be focused on the poorest in our society , everyone else should be expected to pay for their own healthcare .
s. gordon , edinburgh as a nurse of 28yrs in the nhs i am increasingly fearful of our service and ability to deliver to forever increasing government targets .
whilst trying to achieve these we are losing sight of the needs of the patient .
we do n't have the time to spend with them we ca n't sit and hear what they are saying , we ca n't deliver the care we know they need ... why ?
no staff , no resources , constant constraint , persistent relentless government initiatives , etc .
we are in serious danger of no longer knowing what it is we are trying to do and losing sight of what 's important ... patient care .
as far as i am concerned the star rating system should be scrapped it sends the wrong message to the public , takes too much time away from more pressing matters and demoralises the staff of the nhs .
ea , west yorks i currently work in nhs management and i would like to take issue with the comment that managers do n't understand what the nhs stands for .
i joined this organisation so that i could put my skills to use for the good of patient care , rather than for the good of profits .
the nhs is in general staffed by people in all departments , not just clinical but management alike , who have a genuine desire to improve the patient experience .
the nhs has its faults like all organisations , but in general strives to provide the best service it can within its budgetary constraints , something that all the negative media surrounding it does n't help to remind people of .
olive , sheffield not where i live in north bristol , they are going up .
all my experiences with the nhs here have been excellent .
the only thing the local hospital failed on was the 4-hour time limit at a & e. seems to me the important thing about a & e is that people who need to be seen quickly are seen , while those who are able to wait wait .
tom , britsol the star system is a pointless exercise .
it does not accurately reflect how good or bad any hospital is .
hospitals currently only focus on the target , and not on the individual patients .
decisions are often made in a way that compromises patient care , in some cases prioritising a long-waiting routine list case over an emergency admission .
the only progress they produce is in the ability of management to manipulate the data .
robert crowder , todmorden , uk living in thurrock i have to travel 20 miles to my nearest a & e department .
with all these people proposing to build all these houses in thurrock would it not be better to build another hospital first , it is not fair to expect basildon to cope with all the people it will bring in .
denise , south ockendon , essex i wish people would stop complaining about the nhs , the service is 100 times better than the useless health service and doctors in holland -lrb- and you have to pay a lot more over here -rrb- it is so bad , i do n't even bother to go to doctors here anymore as they do nothing at all .
the nhs do the best they can and is probably the best health service in the world , we should be proud of it instead of always complaining .
ian purnell , maastricht holland it needs to be stated that these targets are government set and the role of the trust and health authority managers -lrb- of which i am one -rrb- is to ensure they are successfully achieved .
the causal effect of their implementation however is a resource -lrb- financial and human -rrb- commitment by the trust to achieving them which by implication draws resource away from other clinical areas .
this central direction is not well liked by trusts as it usurps local trust direction but is in direct response to public concern over high profile issues .
however , these results should be treated as indicative rather than definitive .
bob barr , london , uk " my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic " p , leicester as a nurse i have to echo the comments of the a & e doctor , the star system is corrupt .
the trust i work for got its 3 stars , to no ones surprise at all .
we had advance warning of the inspection , even their precise route through the hospital .
needless to say that route was spotless when the peat team arrived , having been attended to by more cleaners than on any normal day .
my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic .
p , leicester so , under the tories we had low taxes and poor hospitals .
under new labour we have high taxes and . poor hospitals .
of those two i think i prefer the former .
matt f , bristol , uk bean counters count beans , not quality .
just because something is measurable does not necessarily mean it is important .
the star ratings are essentially meaningless and therefore any change from year to year is also meaningless .
i am a doctor proud to work as part of the nhs , and am happy to work hard to improve the quality of care given to my patients , hospital star ratings do not help .
andrew brooks , derby , uk i feel very saddened by the ' 1 star ' grading of my local hospital , west suffolk .
it 's been struggling financially for a long while , but during the two operations i 've had in the last couple of years i 've received nothing but the highest standards of care .
it seems to me that sometimes financial and patient-care related targets are mutually exclusive .
david edwards , bury st edmunds , suffolk the trouble with performance indicators is that the government are continually changing the goalposts and changing priorities .
another major hurdle all trusts have had to jump was changing was in pay modernisation .
an inordinately large proportion of time has been given by all staff groups to the detriment of patient care .
the vast majority of staff within the nhs works well in excess of their contracted hours just to keep pace with government demands .
the government should back off and give all trusts time and adequate resources to meet what 's expected of them .
j , middlesbrough uk " before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed " amanda jenkinson , west midlands i think rating hospitals is like rating hotels .
mmsr has a large impact , and the government are simply not funding enough for housekeeping staff to clean the hospitals as they should be .
being a support service assistant myself , i can see where the problems are .
doctors and nurses are stretched .
so before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed .
amanda jenkinson , west midlands having previously worked for the nhs it does not surprise me that hospitals are losing stars .
money is spent on non-essential items instead of medical equipment .
staff would complain at meetings if biscuits were not provided with the tea and coffee and expensive venues were often used to hold the meetings .
many non-medical departments are now based in plush office blocks rather than in the hospitals themselves .
one department , which has only been created for one year for a particular project , has a newly refurbished office and furniture which could not be described as basic .
it is shocking that the nhs can spend money on luxury offices and biscuits for stuffy men in suits when they are already overspending and under performing .
anon , london the health watchdog has said targets are harder this year and ' the overall improvement in performance this year should not be underestimated . '
the disgrace is the headlines saying ' fewer 3 star hospitals ' .
why must the media always try and find failure in success ?
will rossetti , bristol , uk nothing like a good old league table to deplete the morale of thousands of doctors , nurses and nhs staff who work so hard everyday .
has anyone been in an nhs hospital recently ?
the improvement in recent years is staggering .
the standards the government have set are sometimes unreasonable high ; this does n't mean a hospital is ' bad . '
alex , cambridge the star ratings are a farce - my local nhs trust was recently the subject of a panorama special on hospital cleanliness yet it still achieves a pass rating - how can this be ?
stuart hadley , birmingham , uk i am pleased both of my local hospitals have a 3 star status .
however the system will only get better everywhere else when hospitals invest in more support staff instead of wasting millions on a huge senior management structure .
simon young , essex the government requires trust to achieve targets to convince the public that the nhs service is improving .
i am sure that we can see without the targets .
get rid of the targets and audit measurements and use the money in the nhs .
this is a free service , we do n't even pay to visit the doctor !
the public 's expectations of our nhs is far too high .
we have more people using the service than 10 years ago .
what do people expect ?
there is not enough tax paid to fund the large increase in its use .
the nhs will require higher funding from joe public 's purse .
if you want a better health service then you will have to pay at one end or the other .
myself i prefer higher taxes .
jeanette , northampton i 'm still struggling to lower my anger than i had to endure a 3 day traumatic labour before finally needing a c-section under general anaesthetic . because i am lead to believe that my nhs authorities stats for c-sections was already over quota .
i do n't care whether it 's down to finances or hospital management but things like this should not be allowed to happen and both sides should stop blaming each other and instead concentrate together to achieve a better outcome than is clear from the results that have come through today .
sharlie , oxfordshire " the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct " tony , grays , uk working within an nhs trust , i can tell you that everyone is working as hard as possible to ensure the highest level of care possible is achieved .
it 's easy for people to criticise the poor standards , but in recent years the nhs has started to turn around after almost two decades of severe under-funding by prior governments .
the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct , which i can say with confidence , is what everyone working here wants .
tony , grays , uk i am a qualified nurse , i can honestly say that i have given 100 % on every shift i have worked since qualifying in 1998 .
i genuinely care for all my patients , even the ones that swear , bite and scratch .
i care for my patients as if they were my own family .
my passion for nursing is ebbing though when i come to work to be faced with more unrealistic targets stipulated by the government and to be told that we are now a zero rated trust because we were 2 % off one target out of eight .
where is the incentive to give quality nursing care when it is easier to cut corners to meet targets ?
p , leeds , uk the latest results have been published at a time when the public perception of hospital care is at an all-time low .
my hospital , king 's college in south london has lost its 3rd star simply as a result of finance .
the star ratings do not show to the general public the huge improvements made by dedicated and talented nhs staff .
the a & e department at king 's has been commended and shown as one of the best in the uk , and yet a star is still lost !
thank goodness the system is about to change !
dr , london uk the star ratings are a very crude and inaccurate tool indeed , and the amount of cheating / fudging possible to ensure hitting them is immense .
i think what we are seeing here is a combination of less cheating as loopholes are filled , plus chronic under funding becoming impossible to hide any more , and not actually any real degradation of our hospitals .
mark williams , grays , essex i just felt that i had to stick up for the nhs , as it does work well .
i think it needs modernising but i think the problem is too many managers that do n't really understand what the nhs actually stands for .
i would love to see more managers actually having more nursing experience as then they would have a better understanding of what it is like to work in the environment itself . the staff shortages , the shortages of basic equipment i.e hoists , handling belts , to simple things like soap and other toiletries .
however the nurses and other nursing staff do their best , and we experienced this when my father-in-law was operated on and back onto the ward within 3 hours of him going to a + e. the care he received was great .
these ' stars ' are n't a good thing in my opinion - who has the right to be judgemental like that ?
in my opinion it should be the service users themselves i.e the patients and their relatives - if there is a problem , let the staff know .
danni , ipswich , uk " the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort " s , newcastle as an a & e doctor , i can tell you that the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort .
nobody on the coal face pays any attention to them .
the a & e waiting time is a complete joke .
the times are falsified in order to meet the targets , and patients are moved from a & e , against the advice of clinicians , by the managers .
the managers are not accountable to anyone but themselves and make decisions that could adversely affect patient outcomes .
the star rating system has been corrupt since its inception as the chief execs and middle managers focus on the targets that will get them points , at the expense of genuine clinical need .
as we know , points make prizes -lrb- or in this case stars -rrb- .
s , newcastle the majority of health services are delivering really tough targets .
i think that taking services down to a local or regional level does create differences in how health services perform , but perhaps that is an issue about local accountability- and perhaps the public bothering to hold local health chiefs accountable .
it 's important to understand that the nhs was close to collapse a decade ago .
in under 10 years it 's got miles better - not perfect , but then nobody has a magic wand .
i 'm diabetic and the improved service just so far will add years to my life .
chris , london i am delighted to hear that mansfield district primary care trust has retained its 3 star status of excellence .
i have been overwhelmingly pleased by the level of care provided by them over the past three years of my illness .
all the staff based at ransom hall also deserve a round of applause for their commitment to improving services .
well done mansfield district michael jones , mansfield , uk these results show that it is pointless for the government to pour increasing amounts of taxpayers ' money into the national health service before a radical change in management and structure is introduced .
as evidenced in brighton recently in the panorama tv programme filmed in the old people 's ward , top management is unaccountable , anarchy seems to prevail , wards are still filthy , patients are n't cared for - the list is endless .
all this proves that targets are pointless as they only gloss over the rotten foundations .
tony ellis , northwood , england i think it 's absolutely disgusting , the government has nagged on about this being a high priority yet things get worse .
my partner is pregnant and the three hospitals near us in south london have all received poor results , this coupled with the terrible results regarding mrsa on these hospitals has made us decide on a home birth .
i am losing complete faith in our local hospitals to provide a satisfactory service .
the last thing you want to worry about is someone coming out worse than when they went in .
andrew daw , london does the last comment by andrew daw not prove that the star ratings are considered and used by the public .
by choosing a home birth then this couple have opted not to use an acute hospital with a low star rating and instead opted for the home birth with a community mid-wife who will be part of the nhs and attached to -lrb- possibly -rrb- a better performing trust or pct .

this year fewer hospitals in england have received three stars - the top rating - in the health commission 's annual survey .
it 's the first time standards have fallen in four years .
problems with finances and government targets are being blamed .
but primary care , mental health and the ambulance trust have improved , according to the nhs watchdog .
nhs star ratings are to be scrapped - from next year , trusts will be asked to produce annual self-assessments and there will random spot checks on trusts with problems .
what is your experience of nhs hospitals ?
is the star rating system fair ?
what can be done to improve hospitals ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by alison , uk hospitals are allegedly failing to reach certain targets and have , therefore , lost " stars " .
should the government stop setting targets and allow the hospitals to have more autonomy to improve patient care ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates i think the nhs needs to stop appointing nurses and medical staff to managerial positions .
nursing staff are very good at nursing but they are not trained to manage a business .
properly trained managerial staff would be able to manage the business of running a hospital and control the finances .
there are far too many managers in the nhs and by employing a few less managers , and more front line staff then they will be able to do the jobs that actually help hospitals to run every day lucy , uk if people were cans of beans and we all were in supermarkets then i could understand the star rating system because everyone would be the same .
however we are not .
the star rating system is a simplistic and meaningless way of assessing services , just like school league tables .
they are there for the consumption of ' middle england ' and the sound bite politics and journalism we are fed through the media .
here in stoke we have a fantastic hospital with dedicated and hardworking professionals who are doing more with fewer resources and as their rating has fallen they will be in line for yet another rubbishing by the media .
all i want to say is well done you are all stars ...
10 stars that is .
robert fair , staffs having just received treatment for a mild heart attack in fairfield general hospital , bury .
i have nothing but praise for the team in coronary care unit .
i am not surprised that some hospitals are suffering because these days there are too many chiefs in the nhs .
maybe if the cut back on all the unnecessary departments and got back to basics the nhs would be in a better state .
i work within the nhs for a supplier and i know the hassle the staff have to go through to sometimes get basic equipment .
w shepherd , bolton i think that the nhs needs to pay more attention to their management .
managers within the nhs appear to be promoted through their ranks and lack basic management skills .
this results in a waste of resources , money and mismanagement of staff , particularly at the lower grades .
doug powell , london the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients anon , uk the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients .
i would always prefer to wait and see a doctor who actually is an expert than see an inferior / failed doctor instantly i walk into a hospital .
i work in a zero rated university teaching hospital but my department has an international reputation for excellence .
everyone who works in the nhs knows that these rating schemes never measure the things that really matter but are management games .
anon , uk i have been in and out of hospital quite a few times over the last three years and i have had nothing but wonderful service from paramedics , doctors , nurses , and staff less recognised like cleaners .
they have all given me a high standard of care , been incredibly compassionate and kind , and made me feel a whole less frightened by the whole experience .
there is too much talk of low ' star ' service , so i want to take this time to thank all those in the nhs service for everything they have done for me and my loved ones .
you do a great job , guys !
nicole , london i think the nhs is appalling .
i went in to have a lymph node removed and tested last year and came out with a terrible hip infection after i had been operated on .
the lymph node came back clear but i left hospital sicker than when i went in .
sharon , london the national health service is outdated and obsolete .
the limited government resources need to be focused on the poorest in our society , everyone else should be expected to pay for their own healthcare .
s. gordon , edinburgh as a nurse of 28yrs in the nhs i am increasingly fearful of our service and ability to deliver to forever increasing government targets .
whilst trying to achieve these we are losing sight of the needs of the patient .
we do n't have the time to spend with them we ca n't sit and hear what they are saying , we ca n't deliver the care we know they need ... why ?
no staff , no resources , constant constraint , persistent relentless government initiatives , etc .
we are in serious danger of no longer knowing what it is we are trying to do and losing sight of what 's important ... patient care .
as far as i am concerned the star rating system should be scrapped it sends the wrong message to the public , takes too much time away from more pressing matters and demoralises the staff of the nhs .
ea , west yorks i currently work in nhs management and i would like to take issue with the comment that managers do n't understand what the nhs stands for .
i joined this organisation so that i could put my skills to use for the good of patient care , rather than for the good of profits .
the nhs is in general staffed by people in all departments , not just clinical but management alike , who have a genuine desire to improve the patient experience .
the nhs has its faults like all organisations , but in general strives to provide the best service it can within its budgetary constraints , something that all the negative media surrounding it does n't help to remind people of .

by choosing a home birth then this couple have opted not to use an acute hospital with a low star rating and instead opted for the home birth with a community mid-wife who will be part of the nhs and attached to -lrb- possibly -rrb- a better performing trust or pct .

this year fewer hospitals in england have received three stars - the top rating - in the health commission 's annual survey .
it 's the first time standards have fallen in four years .
problems with finances and government targets are being blamed .
but primary care , mental health and the ambulance trust have improved , according to the nhs watchdog .
nhs star ratings are to be scrapped - from next year , trusts will be asked to produce annual self-assessments and there will random spot checks on trusts with problems .
what is your experience of nhs hospitals ?
is the star rating system fair ?
what can be done to improve hospitals ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by alison , uk hospitals are allegedly failing to reach certain targets and have , therefore , lost " stars " .
should the government stop setting targets and allow the hospitals to have more autonomy to improve patient care ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates i think the nhs needs to stop appointing nurses and medical staff to managerial positions .
nursing staff are very good at nursing but they are not trained to manage a business .
properly trained managerial staff would be able to manage the business of running a hospital and control the finances .
there are far too many managers in the nhs and by employing a few less managers , and more front line staff then they will be able to do the jobs that actually help hospitals to run every day lucy , uk if people were cans of beans and we all were in supermarkets then i could understand the star rating system because everyone would be the same .
however we are not .
the star rating system is a simplistic and meaningless way of assessing services , just like school league tables .
they are there for the consumption of ' middle england ' and the sound bite politics and journalism we are fed through the media .
here in stoke we have a fantastic hospital with dedicated and hardworking professionals who are doing more with fewer resources and as their rating has fallen they will be in line for yet another rubbishing by the media .
all i want to say is well done you are all stars ...
10 stars that is .
robert fair , staffs having just received treatment for a mild heart attack in fairfield general hospital , bury .
i have nothing but praise for the team in coronary care unit .
i am not surprised that some hospitals are suffering because these days there are too many chiefs in the nhs .
maybe if the cut back on all the unnecessary departments and got back to basics the nhs would be in a better state .
i work within the nhs for a supplier and i know the hassle the staff have to go through to sometimes get basic equipment .
w shepherd , bolton i think that the nhs needs to pay more attention to their management .
managers within the nhs appear to be promoted through their ranks and lack basic management skills .
this results in a waste of resources , money and mismanagement of staff , particularly at the lower grades .
doug powell , london the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients anon , uk the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients .
i would always prefer to wait and see a doctor who actually is an expert than see an inferior / failed doctor instantly i walk into a hospital .
i work in a zero rated university teaching hospital but my department has an international reputation for excellence .
everyone who works in the nhs knows that these rating schemes never measure the things that really matter but are management games .
anon , uk i have been in and out of hospital quite a few times over the last three years and i have had nothing but wonderful service from paramedics , doctors , nurses , and staff less recognised like cleaners .
they have all given me a high standard of care , been incredibly compassionate and kind , and made me feel a whole less frightened by the whole experience .
there is too much talk of low ' star ' service , so i want to take this time to thank all those in the nhs service for everything they have done for me and my loved ones .
you do a great job , guys !
nicole , london i think the nhs is appalling .
i went in to have a lymph node removed and tested last year and came out with a terrible hip infection after i had been operated on .
the lymph node came back clear but i left hospital sicker than when i went in .
sharon , london the national health service is outdated and obsolete .
the limited government resources need to be focused on the poorest in our society , everyone else should be expected to pay for their own healthcare .
s. gordon , edinburgh as a nurse of 28yrs in the nhs i am increasingly fearful of our service and ability to deliver to forever increasing government targets .
whilst trying to achieve these we are losing sight of the needs of the patient .
we do n't have the time to spend with them we ca n't sit and hear what they are saying , we ca n't deliver the care we know they need ... why ?
no staff , no resources , constant constraint , persistent relentless government initiatives , etc .
we are in serious danger of no longer knowing what it is we are trying to do and losing sight of what 's important ... patient care .
as far as i am concerned the star rating system should be scrapped it sends the wrong message to the public , takes too much time away from more pressing matters and demoralises the staff of the nhs .
ea , west yorks i currently work in nhs management and i would like to take issue with the comment that managers do n't understand what the nhs stands for .
i joined this organisation so that i could put my skills to use for the good of patient care , rather than for the good of profits .
the nhs is in general staffed by people in all departments , not just clinical but management alike , who have a genuine desire to improve the patient experience .
the nhs has its faults like all organisations , but in general strives to provide the best service it can within its budgetary constraints , something that all the negative media surrounding it does n't help to remind people of .
olive , sheffield not where i live in north bristol , they are going up .
all my experiences with the nhs here have been excellent .
the only thing the local hospital failed on was the 4-hour time limit at a & e. seems to me the important thing about a & e is that people who need to be seen quickly are seen , while those who are able to wait wait .
tom , britsol the star system is a pointless exercise .
it does not accurately reflect how good or bad any hospital is .
hospitals currently only focus on the target , and not on the individual patients .
decisions are often made in a way that compromises patient care , in some cases prioritising a long-waiting routine list case over an emergency admission .
the only progress they produce is in the ability of management to manipulate the data .
robert crowder , todmorden , uk living in thurrock i have to travel 20 miles to my nearest a & e department .
with all these people proposing to build all these houses in thurrock would it not be better to build another hospital first , it is not fair to expect basildon to cope with all the people it will bring in .
denise , south ockendon , essex i wish people would stop complaining about the nhs , the service is 100 times better than the useless health service and doctors in holland -lrb- and you have to pay a lot more over here -rrb- it is so bad , i do n't even bother to go to doctors here anymore as they do nothing at all .
the nhs do the best they can and is probably the best health service in the world , we should be proud of it instead of always complaining .
ian purnell , maastricht holland it needs to be stated that these targets are government set and the role of the trust and health authority managers -lrb- of which i am one -rrb- is to ensure they are successfully achieved .
the causal effect of their implementation however is a resource -lrb- financial and human -rrb- commitment by the trust to achieving them which by implication draws resource away from other clinical areas .
this central direction is not well liked by trusts as it usurps local trust direction but is in direct response to public concern over high profile issues .
however , these results should be treated as indicative rather than definitive .
bob barr , london , uk my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic p , leicester as a nurse i have to echo the comments of the a & e doctor , the star system is corrupt .
the trust i work for got its 3 stars , to no ones surprise at all .
we had advance warning of the inspection , even their precise route through the hospital .
needless to say that route was spotless when the peat team arrived , having been attended to by more cleaners than on any normal day .
my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic .
p , leicester so , under the tories we had low taxes and poor hospitals .
under new labour we have high taxes and . poor hospitals .
of those two i think i prefer the former .
matt f , bristol , uk bean counters count beans , not quality .
just because something is measurable does not necessarily mean it is important .
the star ratings are essentially meaningless and therefore any change from year to year is also meaningless .
i am a doctor proud to work as part of the nhs , and am happy to work hard to improve the quality of care given to my patients , hospital star ratings do not help .
andrew brooks , derby , uk i feel very saddened by the ' 1 star ' grading of my local hospital , west suffolk .
it 's been struggling financially for a long while , but during the two operations i 've had in the last couple of years i 've received nothing but the highest standards of care .
it seems to me that sometimes financial and patient-care related targets are mutually exclusive .
david edwards , bury st edmunds , suffolk the trouble with performance indicators is that the government are continually changing the goalposts and changing priorities .
another major hurdle all trusts have had to jump was changing was in pay modernisation .
an inordinately large proportion of time has been given by all staff groups to the detriment of patient care .
the vast majority of staff within the nhs works well in excess of their contracted hours just to keep pace with government demands .
the government should back off and give all trusts time and adequate resources to meet what 's expected of them .
j , middlesbrough uk before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed amanda jenkinson , west midlands i think rating hospitals is like rating hotels .
mmsr has a large impact , and the government are simply not funding enough for housekeeping staff to clean the hospitals as they should be .
being a support service assistant myself , i can see where the problems are .
doctors and nurses are stretched .
so before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed .
amanda jenkinson , west midlands having previously worked for the nhs it does not surprise me that hospitals are losing stars .
money is spent on non-essential items instead of medical equipment .
staff would complain at meetings if biscuits were not provided with the tea and coffee and expensive venues were often used to hold the meetings .
many non-medical departments are now based in plush office blocks rather than in the hospitals themselves .
one department , which has only been created for one year for a particular project , has a newly refurbished office and furniture which could not be described as basic .
it is shocking that the nhs can spend money on luxury offices and biscuits for stuffy men in suits when they are already overspending and under performing .
anon , london the health watchdog has said targets are harder this year and ' the overall improvement in performance this year should not be underestimated . '
the disgrace is the headlines saying ' fewer 3 star hospitals ' .
why must the media always try and find failure in success ?
will rossetti , bristol , uk nothing like a good old league table to deplete the morale of thousands of doctors , nurses and nhs staff who work so hard everyday .
has anyone been in an nhs hospital recently ?
the improvement in recent years is staggering .
the standards the government have set are sometimes unreasonable high ; this does n't mean a hospital is ' bad . '
alex , cambridge the star ratings are a farce - my local nhs trust was recently the subject of a panorama special on hospital cleanliness yet it still achieves a pass rating - how can this be ?
stuart hadley , birmingham , uk i am pleased both of my local hospitals have a 3 star status .
however the system will only get better everywhere else when hospitals invest in more support staff instead of wasting millions on a huge senior management structure .
simon young , essex the government requires trust to achieve targets to convince the public that the nhs service is improving .
i am sure that we can see without the targets .
get rid of the targets and audit measurements and use the money in the nhs .
this is a free service , we do n't even pay to visit the doctor !
the public 's expectations of our nhs is far too high .
we have more people using the service than 10 years ago .
what do people expect ?
there is not enough tax paid to fund the large increase in its use .
the nhs will require higher funding from joe public 's purse .
if you want a better health service then you will have to pay at one end or the other .
myself i prefer higher taxes .
jeanette , northampton i 'm still struggling to lower my anger than i had to endure a 3 day traumatic labour before finally needing a c-section under general anaesthetic . because i am lead to believe that my nhs authorities stats for c-sections was already over quota .
i do n't care whether it 's down to finances or hospital management but things like this should not be allowed to happen and both sides should stop blaming each other and instead concentrate together to achieve a better outcome than is clear from the results that have come through today .
sharlie , oxfordshire the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct tony , grays , uk working within an nhs trust , i can tell you that everyone is working as hard as possible to ensure the highest level of care possible is achieved .
it 's easy for people to criticise the poor standards , but in recent years the nhs has started to turn around after almost two decades of severe under-funding by prior governments .
the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct , which i can say with confidence , is what everyone working here wants .
tony , grays , uk i am a qualified nurse , i can honestly say that i have given 100 % on every shift i have worked since qualifying in 1998 .
i genuinely care for all my patients , even the ones that swear , bite and scratch .
i care for my patients as if they were my own family .
my passion for nursing is ebbing though when i come to work to be faced with more unrealistic targets stipulated by the government and to be told that we are now a zero rated trust because we were 2 % off one target out of eight .
where is the incentive to give quality nursing care when it is easier to cut corners to meet targets ?
p , leeds , uk the latest results have been published at a time when the public perception of hospital care is at an all-time low .
my hospital , king 's college in south london has lost its 3rd star simply as a result of finance .
the star ratings do not show to the general public the huge improvements made by dedicated and talented nhs staff .
the a & e department at king 's has been commended and shown as one of the best in the uk , and yet a star is still lost !
thank goodness the system is about to change !
dr , london uk the star ratings are a very crude and inaccurate tool indeed , and the amount of cheating / fudging possible to ensure hitting them is immense .
i think what we are seeing here is a combination of less cheating as loopholes are filled , plus chronic under funding becoming impossible to hide any more , and not actually any real degradation of our hospitals .
mark williams , grays , essex i just felt that i had to stick up for the nhs , as it does work well .
i think it needs modernising but i think the problem is too many managers that do n't really understand what the nhs actually stands for .
i would love to see more managers actually having more nursing experience as then they would have a better understanding of what it is like to work in the environment itself . the staff shortages , the shortages of basic equipment i.e hoists , handling belts , to simple things like soap and other toiletries .
however the nurses and other nursing staff do their best , and we experienced this when my father-in-law was operated on and back onto the ward within 3 hours of him going to a + e. the care he received was great .
these ' stars ' are n't a good thing in my opinion - who has the right to be judgemental like that ?
in my opinion it should be the service users themselves i.e the patients and their relatives - if there is a problem , let the staff know .
danni , ipswich , uk the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort s , newcastle as an a & e doctor , i can tell you that the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort .
nobody on the coal face pays any attention to them .
the a & e waiting time is a complete joke .
the times are falsified in order to meet the targets , and patients are moved from a & e , against the advice of clinicians , by the managers .
the managers are not accountable to anyone but themselves and make decisions that could adversely affect patient outcomes .
the star rating system has been corrupt since its inception as the chief execs and middle managers focus on the targets that will get them points , at the expense of genuine clinical need .
as we know , points make prizes -lrb- or in this case stars -rrb- .
s , newcastle the majority of health services are delivering really tough targets .
i think that taking services down to a local or regional level does create differences in how health services perform , but perhaps that is an issue about local accountability- and perhaps the public bothering to hold local health chiefs accountable .
it 's important to understand that the nhs was close to collapse a decade ago .
in under 10 years it 's got miles better - not perfect , but then nobody has a magic wand .
i 'm diabetic and the improved service just so far will add years to my life .
chris , london i am delighted to hear that mansfield district primary care trust has retained its 3 star status of excellence .
i have been overwhelmingly pleased by the level of care provided by them over the past three years of my illness .
all the staff based at ransom hall also deserve a round of applause for their commitment to improving services .
well done mansfield district michael jones , mansfield , uk these results show that it is pointless for the government to pour increasing amounts of taxpayers ' money into the national health service before a radical change in management and structure is introduced .
as evidenced in brighton recently in the panorama tv programme filmed in the old people 's ward , top management is unaccountable , anarchy seems to prevail , wards are still filthy , patients are n't cared for - the list is endless .
all this proves that targets are pointless as they only gloss over the rotten foundations .
tony ellis , northwood , england i think it 's absolutely disgusting , the government has nagged on about this being a high priority yet things get worse .
my partner is pregnant and the three hospitals near us in south london have all received poor results , this coupled with the terrible results regarding mrsa on these hospitals has made us decide on a home birth .
i am losing complete faith in our local hospitals to provide a satisfactory service .
the last thing you want to worry about is someone coming out worse than when they went in .
andrew daw , london does the last comment by andrew daw not prove that the star ratings are considered and used by the public .
by choosing a home birth then this couple have opted not to use an acute hospital with a low star rating and instead opted for the home birth with a community mid-wife who will be part of the nhs and attached to -lrb- possibly -rrb- a better performing trust or pct .

the improvement in recent years is staggering .
the standards the government have set are sometimes unreasonable high ; this does n't mean a hospital is ' bad . '
alex , cambridge the star ratings are a farce - my local nhs trust was recently the subject of a panorama special on hospital cleanliness yet it still achieves a pass rating - how can this be ?
stuart hadley , birmingham , uk i am pleased both of my local hospitals have a 3 star status .
however the system will only get better everywhere else when hospitals invest in more support staff instead of wasting millions on a huge senior management structure .
simon young , essex the government requires trust to achieve targets to convince the public that the nhs service is improving .
i am sure that we can see without the targets .
get rid of the targets and audit measurements and use the money in the nhs .
this is a free service , we do n't even pay to visit the doctor !
the public 's expectations of our nhs is far too high .
we have more people using the service than 10 years ago .
what do people expect ?
there is not enough tax paid to fund the large increase in its use .
the nhs will require higher funding from joe public 's purse .
if you want a better health service then you will have to pay at one end or the other .
myself i prefer higher taxes .
jeanette , northampton i 'm still struggling to lower my anger than i had to endure a 3 day traumatic labour before finally needing a c-section under general anaesthetic . because i am lead to believe that my nhs authorities stats for c-sections was already over quota .
i do n't care whether it 's down to finances or hospital management but things like this should not be allowed to happen and both sides should stop blaming each other and instead concentrate together to achieve a better outcome than is clear from the results that have come through today .
sharlie , oxfordshire the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct tony , grays , uk working within an nhs trust , i can tell you that everyone is working as hard as possible to ensure the highest level of care possible is achieved .
it 's easy for people to criticise the poor standards , but in recent years the nhs has started to turn around after almost two decades of severe under-funding by prior governments .
the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct , which i can say with confidence , is what everyone working here wants .
tony , grays , uk i am a qualified nurse , i can honestly say that i have given 100 % on every shift i have worked since qualifying in 1998 .
i genuinely care for all my patients , even the ones that swear , bite and scratch .
i care for my patients as if they were my own family .
my passion for nursing is ebbing though when i come to work to be faced with more unrealistic targets stipulated by the government and to be told that we are now a zero rated trust because we were 2 % off one target out of eight .
where is the incentive to give quality nursing care when it is easier to cut corners to meet targets ?
p , leeds , uk the latest results have been published at a time when the public perception of hospital care is at an all-time low .
my hospital , king 's college in south london has lost its 3rd star simply as a result of finance .
the star ratings do not show to the general public the huge improvements made by dedicated and talented nhs staff .
the a & e department at king 's has been commended and shown as one of the best in the uk , and yet a star is still lost !
thank goodness the system is about to change !
dr , london uk the star ratings are a very crude and inaccurate tool indeed , and the amount of cheating / fudging possible to ensure hitting them is immense .
i think what we are seeing here is a combination of less cheating as loopholes are filled , plus chronic under funding becoming impossible to hide any more , and not actually any real degradation of our hospitals .
mark williams , grays , essex i just felt that i had to stick up for the nhs , as it does work well .
i think it needs modernising but i think the problem is too many managers that do n't really understand what the nhs actually stands for .
i would love to see more managers actually having more nursing experience as then they would have a better understanding of what it is like to work in the environment itself . the staff shortages , the shortages of basic equipment i.e hoists , handling belts , to simple things like soap and other toiletries .
however the nurses and other nursing staff do their best , and we experienced this when my father-in-law was operated on and back onto the ward within 3 hours of him going to a + e. the care he received was great .
these ' stars ' are n't a good thing in my opinion - who has the right to be judgemental like that ?
in my opinion it should be the service users themselves i.e the patients and their relatives - if there is a problem , let the staff know .
danni , ipswich , uk the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort s , newcastle as an a & e doctor , i can tell you that the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort .
nobody on the coal face pays any attention to them .
the a & e waiting time is a complete joke .
the times are falsified in order to meet the targets , and patients are moved from a & e , against the advice of clinicians , by the managers .
the managers are not accountable to anyone but themselves and make decisions that could adversely affect patient outcomes .
the star rating system has been corrupt since its inception as the chief execs and middle managers focus on the targets that will get them points , at the expense of genuine clinical need .
as we know , points make prizes -lrb- or in this case stars -rrb- .
s , newcastle the majority of health services are delivering really tough targets .
i think that taking services down to a local or regional level does create differences in how health services perform , but perhaps that is an issue about local accountability- and perhaps the public bothering to hold local health chiefs accountable .
it 's important to understand that the nhs was close to collapse a decade ago .
in under 10 years it 's got miles better - not perfect , but then nobody has a magic wand .
i 'm diabetic and the improved service just so far will add years to my life .
chris , london i am delighted to hear that mansfield district primary care trust has retained its 3 star status of excellence .
i have been overwhelmingly pleased by the level of care provided by them over the past three years of my illness .
all the staff based at ransom hall also deserve a round of applause for their commitment to improving services .
well done mansfield district michael jones , mansfield , uk these results show that it is pointless for the government to pour increasing amounts of taxpayers ' money into the national health service before a radical change in management and structure is introduced .
as evidenced in brighton recently in the panorama tv programme filmed in the old people 's ward , top management is unaccountable , anarchy seems to prevail , wards are still filthy , patients are n't cared for - the list is endless .
all this proves that targets are pointless as they only gloss over the rotten foundations .
tony ellis , northwood , england i think it 's absolutely disgusting , the government has nagged on about this being a high priority yet things get worse .
my partner is pregnant and the three hospitals near us in south london have all received poor results , this coupled with the terrible results regarding mrsa on these hospitals has made us decide on a home birth .
i am losing complete faith in our local hospitals to provide a satisfactory service .
the last thing you want to worry about is someone coming out worse than when they went in .
andrew daw , london does the last comment by andrew daw not prove that the star ratings are considered and used by the public .
by choosing a home birth then this couple have opted not to use an acute hospital with a low star rating and instead opted for the home birth with a community mid-wife who will be part of the nhs and attached to -lrb- possibly -rrb- a better performing trust or pct .

this year fewer hospitals in england have received three stars - the top rating - in the health commission 's annual survey .
it 's the first time standards have fallen in four years .
problems with finances and government targets are being blamed .
but primary care , mental health and the ambulance trust have improved , according to the nhs watchdog .
nhs star ratings are to be scrapped - from next year , trusts will be asked to produce annual self-assessments and there will random spot checks on trusts with problems .
what is your experience of nhs hospitals ?
is the star rating system fair ?
what can be done to improve hospitals ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by alison , uk hospitals are allegedly failing to reach certain targets and have , therefore , lost " stars " .
should the government stop setting targets and allow the hospitals to have more autonomy to improve patient care ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates i think the nhs needs to stop appointing nurses and medical staff to managerial positions .
nursing staff are very good at nursing but they are not trained to manage a business .
properly trained managerial staff would be able to manage the business of running a hospital and control the finances .
there are far too many managers in the nhs and by employing a few less managers , and more front line staff then they will be able to do the jobs that actually help hospitals to run every day lucy , uk if people were cans of beans and we all were in supermarkets then i could understand the star rating system because everyone would be the same .
however we are not .
the star rating system is a simplistic and meaningless way of assessing services , just like school league tables .
they are there for the consumption of ' middle england ' and the sound bite politics and journalism we are fed through the media .
here in stoke we have a fantastic hospital with dedicated and hardworking professionals who are doing more with fewer resources and as their rating has fallen they will be in line for yet another rubbishing by the media .
all i want to say is well done you are all stars ...
10 stars that is .
robert fair , staffs having just received treatment for a mild heart attack in fairfield general hospital , bury .
i have nothing but praise for the team in coronary care unit .
i am not surprised that some hospitals are suffering because these days there are too many chiefs in the nhs .
maybe if the cut back on all the unnecessary departments and got back to basics the nhs would be in a better state .
i work within the nhs for a supplier and i know the hassle the staff have to go through to sometimes get basic equipment .
w shepherd , bolton i think that the nhs needs to pay more attention to their management .
managers within the nhs appear to be promoted through their ranks and lack basic management skills .
this results in a waste of resources , money and mismanagement of staff , particularly at the lower grades .
doug powell , london the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients anon , uk the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients .
i would always prefer to wait and see a doctor who actually is an expert than see an inferior / failed doctor instantly i walk into a hospital .
i work in a zero rated university teaching hospital but my department has an international reputation for excellence .
everyone who works in the nhs knows that these rating schemes never measure the things that really matter but are management games .
anon , uk i have been in and out of hospital quite a few times over the last three years and i have had nothing but wonderful service from paramedics , doctors , nurses , and staff less recognised like cleaners .
they have all given me a high standard of care , been incredibly compassionate and kind , and made me feel a whole less frightened by the whole experience .
there is too much talk of low ' star ' service , so i want to take this time to thank all those in the nhs service for everything they have done for me and my loved ones .
you do a great job , guys !
nicole , london i think the nhs is appalling .
i went in to have a lymph node removed and tested last year and came out with a terrible hip infection after i had been operated on .
the lymph node came back clear but i left hospital sicker than when i went in .
sharon , london the national health service is outdated and obsolete .
the limited government resources need to be focused on the poorest in our society , everyone else should be expected to pay for their own healthcare .
s. gordon , edinburgh as a nurse of 28yrs in the nhs i am increasingly fearful of our service and ability to deliver to forever increasing government targets .
whilst trying to achieve these we are losing sight of the needs of the patient .
we do n't have the time to spend with them we ca n't sit and hear what they are saying , we ca n't deliver the care we know they need ... why ?
no staff , no resources , constant constraint , persistent relentless government initiatives , etc .
we are in serious danger of no longer knowing what it is we are trying to do and losing sight of what 's important ... patient care .
as far as i am concerned the star rating system should be scrapped it sends the wrong message to the public , takes too much time away from more pressing matters and demoralises the staff of the nhs .
ea , west yorks i currently work in nhs management and i would like to take issue with the comment that managers do n't understand what the nhs stands for .
i joined this organisation so that i could put my skills to use for the good of patient care , rather than for the good of profits .
the nhs is in general staffed by people in all departments , not just clinical but management alike , who have a genuine desire to improve the patient experience .
the nhs has its faults like all organisations , but in general strives to provide the best service it can within its budgetary constraints , something that all the negative media surrounding it does n't help to remind people of .
olive , sheffield not where i live in north bristol , they are going up .
all my experiences with the nhs here have been excellent .
the only thing the local hospital failed on was the 4-hour time limit at a & e. seems to me the important thing about a & e is that people who need to be seen quickly are seen , while those who are able to wait wait .
tom , britsol the star system is a pointless exercise .
it does not accurately reflect how good or bad any hospital is .
hospitals currently only focus on the target , and not on the individual patients .
decisions are often made in a way that compromises patient care , in some cases prioritising a long-waiting routine list case over an emergency admission .
the only progress they produce is in the ability of management to manipulate the data .
robert crowder , todmorden , uk living in thurrock i have to travel 20 miles to my nearest a & e department .
with all these people proposing to build all these houses in thurrock would it not be better to build another hospital first , it is not fair to expect basildon to cope with all the people it will bring in .
denise , south ockendon , essex i wish people would stop complaining about the nhs , the service is 100 times better than the useless health service and doctors in holland -lrb- and you have to pay a lot more over here -rrb- it is so bad , i do n't even bother to go to doctors here anymore as they do nothing at all .
the nhs do the best they can and is probably the best health service in the world , we should be proud of it instead of always complaining .
ian purnell , maastricht holland it needs to be stated that these targets are government set and the role of the trust and health authority managers -lrb- of which i am one -rrb- is to ensure they are successfully achieved .
the causal effect of their implementation however is a resource -lrb- financial and human -rrb- commitment by the trust to achieving them which by implication draws resource away from other clinical areas .
this central direction is not well liked by trusts as it usurps local trust direction but is in direct response to public concern over high profile issues .
however , these results should be treated as indicative rather than definitive .
bob barr , london , uk my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic p , leicester as a nurse i have to echo the comments of the a & e doctor , the star system is corrupt .
the trust i work for got its 3 stars , to no ones surprise at all .
we had advance warning of the inspection , even their precise route through the hospital .
needless to say that route was spotless when the peat team arrived , having been attended to by more cleaners than on any normal day .
my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic .
p , leicester so , under the tories we had low taxes and poor hospitals .
under new labour we have high taxes and . poor hospitals .
of those two i think i prefer the former .
matt f , bristol , uk bean counters count beans , not quality .
just because something is measurable does not necessarily mean it is important .
the star ratings are essentially meaningless and therefore any change from year to year is also meaningless .
i am a doctor proud to work as part of the nhs , and am happy to work hard to improve the quality of care given to my patients , hospital star ratings do not help .
andrew brooks , derby , uk i feel very saddened by the ' 1 star ' grading of my local hospital , west suffolk .
it 's been struggling financially for a long while , but during the two operations i 've had in the last couple of years i 've received nothing but the highest standards of care .
it seems to me that sometimes financial and patient-care related targets are mutually exclusive .
david edwards , bury st edmunds , suffolk the trouble with performance indicators is that the government are continually changing the goalposts and changing priorities .
another major hurdle all trusts have had to jump was changing was in pay modernisation .
an inordinately large proportion of time has been given by all staff groups to the detriment of patient care .
the vast majority of staff within the nhs works well in excess of their contracted hours just to keep pace with government demands .
the government should back off and give all trusts time and adequate resources to meet what 's expected of them .
j , middlesbrough uk before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed amanda jenkinson , west midlands i think rating hospitals is like rating hotels .
mmsr has a large impact , and the government are simply not funding enough for housekeeping staff to clean the hospitals as they should be .
being a support service assistant myself , i can see where the problems are .
doctors and nurses are stretched .
so before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed .
amanda jenkinson , west midlands having previously worked for the nhs it does not surprise me that hospitals are losing stars .
money is spent on non-essential items instead of medical equipment .
staff would complain at meetings if biscuits were not provided with the tea and coffee and expensive venues were often used to hold the meetings .
many non-medical departments are now based in plush office blocks rather than in the hospitals themselves .
one department , which has only been created for one year for a particular project , has a newly refurbished office and furniture which could not be described as basic .
it is shocking that the nhs can spend money on luxury offices and biscuits for stuffy men in suits when they are already overspending and under performing .
anon , london the health watchdog has said targets are harder this year and ' the overall improvement in performance this year should not be underestimated . '
the disgrace is the headlines saying ' fewer 3 star hospitals ' .
why must the media always try and find failure in success ?
will rossetti , bristol , uk nothing like a good old league table to deplete the morale of thousands of doctors , nurses and nhs staff who work so hard everyday .

the lymph node came back clear but i left hospital sicker than when i went in .
sharon , london the national health service is outdated and obsolete .
the limited government resources need to be focused on the poorest in our society , everyone else should be expected to pay for their own healthcare .
s. gordon , edinburgh as a nurse of 28yrs in the nhs i am increasingly fearful of our service and ability to deliver to forever increasing government targets .
whilst trying to achieve these we are losing sight of the needs of the patient .
we do n't have the time to spend with them we ca n't sit and hear what they are saying , we ca n't deliver the care we know they need ... why ?
no staff , no resources , constant constraint , persistent relentless government initiatives , etc .
we are in serious danger of no longer knowing what it is we are trying to do and losing sight of what 's important ... patient care .
as far as i am concerned the star rating system should be scrapped it sends the wrong message to the public , takes too much time away from more pressing matters and demoralises the staff of the nhs .
ea , west yorks i currently work in nhs management and i would like to take issue with the comment that managers do n't understand what the nhs stands for .
i joined this organisation so that i could put my skills to use for the good of patient care , rather than for the good of profits .
the nhs is in general staffed by people in all departments , not just clinical but management alike , who have a genuine desire to improve the patient experience .
the nhs has its faults like all organisations , but in general strives to provide the best service it can within its budgetary constraints , something that all the negative media surrounding it does n't help to remind people of .
olive , sheffield not where i live in north bristol , they are going up .
all my experiences with the nhs here have been excellent .
the only thing the local hospital failed on was the 4-hour time limit at a & e. seems to me the important thing about a & e is that people who need to be seen quickly are seen , while those who are able to wait wait .
tom , britsol the star system is a pointless exercise .
it does not accurately reflect how good or bad any hospital is .
hospitals currently only focus on the target , and not on the individual patients .
decisions are often made in a way that compromises patient care , in some cases prioritising a long-waiting routine list case over an emergency admission .
the only progress they produce is in the ability of management to manipulate the data .
robert crowder , todmorden , uk living in thurrock i have to travel 20 miles to my nearest a & e department .
with all these people proposing to build all these houses in thurrock would it not be better to build another hospital first , it is not fair to expect basildon to cope with all the people it will bring in .
denise , south ockendon , essex i wish people would stop complaining about the nhs , the service is 100 times better than the useless health service and doctors in holland -lrb- and you have to pay a lot more over here -rrb- it is so bad , i do n't even bother to go to doctors here anymore as they do nothing at all .
the nhs do the best they can and is probably the best health service in the world , we should be proud of it instead of always complaining .
ian purnell , maastricht holland it needs to be stated that these targets are government set and the role of the trust and health authority managers -lrb- of which i am one -rrb- is to ensure they are successfully achieved .
the causal effect of their implementation however is a resource -lrb- financial and human -rrb- commitment by the trust to achieving them which by implication draws resource away from other clinical areas .
this central direction is not well liked by trusts as it usurps local trust direction but is in direct response to public concern over high profile issues .
however , these results should be treated as indicative rather than definitive .
bob barr , london , uk my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic p , leicester as a nurse i have to echo the comments of the a & e doctor , the star system is corrupt .
the trust i work for got its 3 stars , to no ones surprise at all .
we had advance warning of the inspection , even their precise route through the hospital .
needless to say that route was spotless when the peat team arrived , having been attended to by more cleaners than on any normal day .
my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic .
p , leicester so , under the tories we had low taxes and poor hospitals .
under new labour we have high taxes and . poor hospitals .
of those two i think i prefer the former .
matt f , bristol , uk bean counters count beans , not quality .
just because something is measurable does not necessarily mean it is important .
the star ratings are essentially meaningless and therefore any change from year to year is also meaningless .
i am a doctor proud to work as part of the nhs , and am happy to work hard to improve the quality of care given to my patients , hospital star ratings do not help .
andrew brooks , derby , uk i feel very saddened by the ' 1 star ' grading of my local hospital , west suffolk .
it 's been struggling financially for a long while , but during the two operations i 've had in the last couple of years i 've received nothing but the highest standards of care .
it seems to me that sometimes financial and patient-care related targets are mutually exclusive .
david edwards , bury st edmunds , suffolk the trouble with performance indicators is that the government are continually changing the goalposts and changing priorities .
another major hurdle all trusts have had to jump was changing was in pay modernisation .
an inordinately large proportion of time has been given by all staff groups to the detriment of patient care .
the vast majority of staff within the nhs works well in excess of their contracted hours just to keep pace with government demands .
the government should back off and give all trusts time and adequate resources to meet what 's expected of them .
j , middlesbrough uk before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed amanda jenkinson , west midlands i think rating hospitals is like rating hotels .
mmsr has a large impact , and the government are simply not funding enough for housekeeping staff to clean the hospitals as they should be .
being a support service assistant myself , i can see where the problems are .
doctors and nurses are stretched .
so before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed .
amanda jenkinson , west midlands having previously worked for the nhs it does not surprise me that hospitals are losing stars .
money is spent on non-essential items instead of medical equipment .
staff would complain at meetings if biscuits were not provided with the tea and coffee and expensive venues were often used to hold the meetings .
many non-medical departments are now based in plush office blocks rather than in the hospitals themselves .
one department , which has only been created for one year for a particular project , has a newly refurbished office and furniture which could not be described as basic .
it is shocking that the nhs can spend money on luxury offices and biscuits for stuffy men in suits when they are already overspending and under performing .
anon , london the health watchdog has said targets are harder this year and ' the overall improvement in performance this year should not be underestimated . '
the disgrace is the headlines saying ' fewer 3 star hospitals ' .
why must the media always try and find failure in success ?
will rossetti , bristol , uk nothing like a good old league table to deplete the morale of thousands of doctors , nurses and nhs staff who work so hard everyday .
has anyone been in an nhs hospital recently ?
the improvement in recent years is staggering .
the standards the government have set are sometimes unreasonable high ; this does n't mean a hospital is ' bad . '
alex , cambridge the star ratings are a farce - my local nhs trust was recently the subject of a panorama special on hospital cleanliness yet it still achieves a pass rating - how can this be ?
stuart hadley , birmingham , uk i am pleased both of my local hospitals have a 3 star status .
however the system will only get better everywhere else when hospitals invest in more support staff instead of wasting millions on a huge senior management structure .
simon young , essex the government requires trust to achieve targets to convince the public that the nhs service is improving .
i am sure that we can see without the targets .
get rid of the targets and audit measurements and use the money in the nhs .
this is a free service , we do n't even pay to visit the doctor !
the public 's expectations of our nhs is far too high .
we have more people using the service than 10 years ago .
what do people expect ?
there is not enough tax paid to fund the large increase in its use .
the nhs will require higher funding from joe public 's purse .
if you want a better health service then you will have to pay at one end or the other .
myself i prefer higher taxes .
jeanette , northampton i 'm still struggling to lower my anger than i had to endure a 3 day traumatic labour before finally needing a c-section under general anaesthetic . because i am lead to believe that my nhs authorities stats for c-sections was already over quota .
i do n't care whether it 's down to finances or hospital management but things like this should not be allowed to happen and both sides should stop blaming each other and instead concentrate together to achieve a better outcome than is clear from the results that have come through today .
sharlie , oxfordshire the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct tony , grays , uk working within an nhs trust , i can tell you that everyone is working as hard as possible to ensure the highest level of care possible is achieved .
it 's easy for people to criticise the poor standards , but in recent years the nhs has started to turn around after almost two decades of severe under-funding by prior governments .
the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct , which i can say with confidence , is what everyone working here wants .
tony , grays , uk i am a qualified nurse , i can honestly say that i have given 100 % on every shift i have worked since qualifying in 1998 .
i genuinely care for all my patients , even the ones that swear , bite and scratch .
i care for my patients as if they were my own family .
my passion for nursing is ebbing though when i come to work to be faced with more unrealistic targets stipulated by the government and to be told that we are now a zero rated trust because we were 2 % off one target out of eight .
where is the incentive to give quality nursing care when it is easier to cut corners to meet targets ?
p , leeds , uk the latest results have been published at a time when the public perception of hospital care is at an all-time low .
my hospital , king 's college in south london has lost its 3rd star simply as a result of finance .
the star ratings do not show to the general public the huge improvements made by dedicated and talented nhs staff .
the a & e department at king 's has been commended and shown as one of the best in the uk , and yet a star is still lost !
thank goodness the system is about to change !
dr , london uk the star ratings are a very crude and inaccurate tool indeed , and the amount of cheating / fudging possible to ensure hitting them is immense .
i think what we are seeing here is a combination of less cheating as loopholes are filled , plus chronic under funding becoming impossible to hide any more , and not actually any real degradation of our hospitals .
mark williams , grays , essex i just felt that i had to stick up for the nhs , as it does work well .
i think it needs modernising but i think the problem is too many managers that do n't really understand what the nhs actually stands for .
i would love to see more managers actually having more nursing experience as then they would have a better understanding of what it is like to work in the environment itself . the staff shortages , the shortages of basic equipment i.e hoists , handling belts , to simple things like soap and other toiletries .
however the nurses and other nursing staff do their best , and we experienced this when my father-in-law was operated on and back onto the ward within 3 hours of him going to a + e. the care he received was great .
these ' stars ' are n't a good thing in my opinion - who has the right to be judgemental like that ?
in my opinion it should be the service users themselves i.e the patients and their relatives - if there is a problem , let the staff know .
danni , ipswich , uk the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort s , newcastle as an a & e doctor , i can tell you that the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort .
nobody on the coal face pays any attention to them .
the a & e waiting time is a complete joke .
the times are falsified in order to meet the targets , and patients are moved from a & e , against the advice of clinicians , by the managers .
the managers are not accountable to anyone but themselves and make decisions that could adversely affect patient outcomes .
the star rating system has been corrupt since its inception as the chief execs and middle managers focus on the targets that will get them points , at the expense of genuine clinical need .
as we know , points make prizes -lrb- or in this case stars -rrb- .
s , newcastle the majority of health services are delivering really tough targets .
i think that taking services down to a local or regional level does create differences in how health services perform , but perhaps that is an issue about local accountability- and perhaps the public bothering to hold local health chiefs accountable .
it 's important to understand that the nhs was close to collapse a decade ago .
in under 10 years it 's got miles better - not perfect , but then nobody has a magic wand .
i 'm diabetic and the improved service just so far will add years to my life .
chris , london i am delighted to hear that mansfield district primary care trust has retained its 3 star status of excellence .
i have been overwhelmingly pleased by the level of care provided by them over the past three years of my illness .
all the staff based at ransom hall also deserve a round of applause for their commitment to improving services .
well done mansfield district michael jones , mansfield , uk these results show that it is pointless for the government to pour increasing amounts of taxpayers ' money into the national health service before a radical change in management and structure is introduced .
as evidenced in brighton recently in the panorama tv programme filmed in the old people 's ward , top management is unaccountable , anarchy seems to prevail , wards are still filthy , patients are n't cared for - the list is endless .
all this proves that targets are pointless as they only gloss over the rotten foundations .
tony ellis , northwood , england i think it 's absolutely disgusting , the government has nagged on about this being a high priority yet things get worse .
my partner is pregnant and the three hospitals near us in south london have all received poor results , this coupled with the terrible results regarding mrsa on these hospitals has made us decide on a home birth .
i am losing complete faith in our local hospitals to provide a satisfactory service .
the last thing you want to worry about is someone coming out worse than when they went in .
andrew daw , london does the last comment by andrew daw not prove that the star ratings are considered and used by the public .
by choosing a home birth then this couple have opted not to use an acute hospital with a low star rating and instead opted for the home birth with a community mid-wife who will be part of the nhs and attached to -lrb- possibly -rrb- a better performing trust or pct .

this year fewer hospitals in england have received three stars - the top rating - in the health commission 's annual survey .
it 's the first time standards have fallen in four years .
problems with finances and government targets are being blamed .
but primary care , mental health and the ambulance trust have improved , according to the nhs watchdog .
nhs star ratings are to be scrapped - from next year , trusts will be asked to produce annual self-assessments and there will random spot checks on trusts with problems .
what is your experience of nhs hospitals ?
is the star rating system fair ?
what can be done to improve hospitals ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by alison , uk hospitals are allegedly failing to reach certain targets and have , therefore , lost " stars " .
should the government stop setting targets and allow the hospitals to have more autonomy to improve patient care ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates i think the nhs needs to stop appointing nurses and medical staff to managerial positions .
nursing staff are very good at nursing but they are not trained to manage a business .
properly trained managerial staff would be able to manage the business of running a hospital and control the finances .
there are far too many managers in the nhs and by employing a few less managers , and more front line staff then they will be able to do the jobs that actually help hospitals to run every day lucy , uk if people were cans of beans and we all were in supermarkets then i could understand the star rating system because everyone would be the same .
however we are not .
the star rating system is a simplistic and meaningless way of assessing services , just like school league tables .
they are there for the consumption of ' middle england ' and the sound bite politics and journalism we are fed through the media .
here in stoke we have a fantastic hospital with dedicated and hardworking professionals who are doing more with fewer resources and as their rating has fallen they will be in line for yet another rubbishing by the media .
all i want to say is well done you are all stars ...
10 stars that is .
robert fair , staffs having just received treatment for a mild heart attack in fairfield general hospital , bury .
i have nothing but praise for the team in coronary care unit .
i am not surprised that some hospitals are suffering because these days there are too many chiefs in the nhs .
maybe if the cut back on all the unnecessary departments and got back to basics the nhs would be in a better state .
i work within the nhs for a supplier and i know the hassle the staff have to go through to sometimes get basic equipment .
w shepherd , bolton i think that the nhs needs to pay more attention to their management .
managers within the nhs appear to be promoted through their ranks and lack basic management skills .
this results in a waste of resources , money and mismanagement of staff , particularly at the lower grades .
doug powell , london the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients anon , uk the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients .
i would always prefer to wait and see a doctor who actually is an expert than see an inferior / failed doctor instantly i walk into a hospital .
i work in a zero rated university teaching hospital but my department has an international reputation for excellence .
everyone who works in the nhs knows that these rating schemes never measure the things that really matter but are management games .
anon , uk i have been in and out of hospital quite a few times over the last three years and i have had nothing but wonderful service from paramedics , doctors , nurses , and staff less recognised like cleaners .
they have all given me a high standard of care , been incredibly compassionate and kind , and made me feel a whole less frightened by the whole experience .
there is too much talk of low ' star ' service , so i want to take this time to thank all those in the nhs service for everything they have done for me and my loved ones .
you do a great job , guys !

i think that taking services down to a local or regional level does create differences in how health services perform , but perhaps that is an issue about local accountability- and perhaps the public bothering to hold local health chiefs accountable .
it 's important to understand that the nhs was close to collapse a decade ago .
in under 10 years it 's got miles better - not perfect , but then nobody has a magic wand .
i 'm diabetic and the improved service just so far will add years to my life .
chris , london i am delighted to hear that mansfield district primary care trust has retained its 3 star status of excellence .
i have been overwhelmingly pleased by the level of care provided by them over the past three years of my illness .
all the staff based at ransom hall also deserve a round of applause for their commitment to improving services .
well done mansfield district michael jones , mansfield , uk these results show that it is pointless for the government to pour increasing amounts of taxpayers ' money into the national health service before a radical change in management and structure is introduced .
as evidenced in brighton recently in the panorama tv programme filmed in the old people 's ward , top management is unaccountable , anarchy seems to prevail , wards are still filthy , patients are n't cared for - the list is endless .
all this proves that targets are pointless as they only gloss over the rotten foundations .
tony ellis , northwood , england i think it 's absolutely disgusting , the government has nagged on about this being a high priority yet things get worse .
my partner is pregnant and the three hospitals near us in south london have all received poor results , this coupled with the terrible results regarding mrsa on these hospitals has made us decide on a home birth .
i am losing complete faith in our local hospitals to provide a satisfactory service .
the last thing you want to worry about is someone coming out worse than when they went in .
andrew daw , london does the last comment by andrew daw not prove that the star ratings are considered and used by the public .
by choosing a home birth then this couple have opted not to use an acute hospital with a low star rating and instead opted for the home birth with a community mid-wife who will be part of the nhs and attached to -lrb- possibly -rrb- a better performing trust or pct .

this year fewer hospitals in england have received three stars - the top rating - in the health commission 's annual survey .
it 's the first time standards have fallen in four years .
problems with finances and government targets are being blamed .
but primary care , mental health and the ambulance trust have improved , according to the nhs watchdog .
nhs star ratings are to be scrapped - from next year , trusts will be asked to produce annual self-assessments and there will random spot checks on trusts with problems .
what is your experience of nhs hospitals ?
is the star rating system fair ?
what can be done to improve hospitals ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by alison , uk hospitals are allegedly failing to reach certain targets and have , therefore , lost " stars " .
should the government stop setting targets and allow the hospitals to have more autonomy to improve patient care ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates i think the nhs needs to stop appointing nurses and medical staff to managerial positions .
nursing staff are very good at nursing but they are not trained to manage a business .
properly trained managerial staff would be able to manage the business of running a hospital and control the finances .
there are far too many managers in the nhs and by employing a few less managers , and more front line staff then they will be able to do the jobs that actually help hospitals to run every day lucy , uk if people were cans of beans and we all were in supermarkets then i could understand the star rating system because everyone would be the same .
however we are not .
the star rating system is a simplistic and meaningless way of assessing services , just like school league tables .
they are there for the consumption of ' middle england ' and the sound bite politics and journalism we are fed through the media .
here in stoke we have a fantastic hospital with dedicated and hardworking professionals who are doing more with fewer resources and as their rating has fallen they will be in line for yet another rubbishing by the media .
all i want to say is well done you are all stars ...
10 stars that is .
robert fair , staffs having just received treatment for a mild heart attack in fairfield general hospital , bury .
i have nothing but praise for the team in coronary care unit .
i am not surprised that some hospitals are suffering because these days there are too many chiefs in the nhs .
maybe if the cut back on all the unnecessary departments and got back to basics the nhs would be in a better state .
i work within the nhs for a supplier and i know the hassle the staff have to go through to sometimes get basic equipment .
w shepherd , bolton i think that the nhs needs to pay more attention to their management .
managers within the nhs appear to be promoted through their ranks and lack basic management skills .
this results in a waste of resources , money and mismanagement of staff , particularly at the lower grades .
doug powell , london the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients anon , uk the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients .
i would always prefer to wait and see a doctor who actually is an expert than see an inferior / failed doctor instantly i walk into a hospital .
i work in a zero rated university teaching hospital but my department has an international reputation for excellence .
everyone who works in the nhs knows that these rating schemes never measure the things that really matter but are management games .
anon , uk i have been in and out of hospital quite a few times over the last three years and i have had nothing but wonderful service from paramedics , doctors , nurses , and staff less recognised like cleaners .
they have all given me a high standard of care , been incredibly compassionate and kind , and made me feel a whole less frightened by the whole experience .
there is too much talk of low ' star ' service , so i want to take this time to thank all those in the nhs service for everything they have done for me and my loved ones .
you do a great job , guys !
nicole , london i think the nhs is appalling .
i went in to have a lymph node removed and tested last year and came out with a terrible hip infection after i had been operated on .
the lymph node came back clear but i left hospital sicker than when i went in .
sharon , london the national health service is outdated and obsolete .
the limited government resources need to be focused on the poorest in our society , everyone else should be expected to pay for their own healthcare .
s. gordon , edinburgh as a nurse of 28yrs in the nhs i am increasingly fearful of our service and ability to deliver to forever increasing government targets .
whilst trying to achieve these we are losing sight of the needs of the patient .
we do n't have the time to spend with them we ca n't sit and hear what they are saying , we ca n't deliver the care we know they need ... why ?
no staff , no resources , constant constraint , persistent relentless government initiatives , etc .
we are in serious danger of no longer knowing what it is we are trying to do and losing sight of what 's important ... patient care .
as far as i am concerned the star rating system should be scrapped it sends the wrong message to the public , takes too much time away from more pressing matters and demoralises the staff of the nhs .
ea , west yorks i currently work in nhs management and i would like to take issue with the comment that managers do n't understand what the nhs stands for .
i joined this organisation so that i could put my skills to use for the good of patient care , rather than for the good of profits .
the nhs is in general staffed by people in all departments , not just clinical but management alike , who have a genuine desire to improve the patient experience .
the nhs has its faults like all organisations , but in general strives to provide the best service it can within its budgetary constraints , something that all the negative media surrounding it does n't help to remind people of .
olive , sheffield not where i live in north bristol , they are going up .
all my experiences with the nhs here have been excellent .
the only thing the local hospital failed on was the 4-hour time limit at a & e. seems to me the important thing about a & e is that people who need to be seen quickly are seen , while those who are able to wait wait .
tom , britsol the star system is a pointless exercise .
it does not accurately reflect how good or bad any hospital is .
hospitals currently only focus on the target , and not on the individual patients .
decisions are often made in a way that compromises patient care , in some cases prioritising a long-waiting routine list case over an emergency admission .
the only progress they produce is in the ability of management to manipulate the data .
robert crowder , todmorden , uk living in thurrock i have to travel 20 miles to my nearest a & e department .
with all these people proposing to build all these houses in thurrock would it not be better to build another hospital first , it is not fair to expect basildon to cope with all the people it will bring in .
denise , south ockendon , essex i wish people would stop complaining about the nhs , the service is 100 times better than the useless health service and doctors in holland -lrb- and you have to pay a lot more over here -rrb- it is so bad , i do n't even bother to go to doctors here anymore as they do nothing at all .
the nhs do the best they can and is probably the best health service in the world , we should be proud of it instead of always complaining .
ian purnell , maastricht holland it needs to be stated that these targets are government set and the role of the trust and health authority managers -lrb- of which i am one -rrb- is to ensure they are successfully achieved .
the causal effect of their implementation however is a resource -lrb- financial and human -rrb- commitment by the trust to achieving them which by implication draws resource away from other clinical areas .
this central direction is not well liked by trusts as it usurps local trust direction but is in direct response to public concern over high profile issues .
however , these results should be treated as indicative rather than definitive .
bob barr , london , uk my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic p , leicester as a nurse i have to echo the comments of the a & e doctor , the star system is corrupt .
the trust i work for got its 3 stars , to no ones surprise at all .
we had advance warning of the inspection , even their precise route through the hospital .
needless to say that route was spotless when the peat team arrived , having been attended to by more cleaners than on any normal day .
my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic .
p , leicester so , under the tories we had low taxes and poor hospitals .
under new labour we have high taxes and . poor hospitals .
of those two i think i prefer the former .
matt f , bristol , uk bean counters count beans , not quality .
just because something is measurable does not necessarily mean it is important .
the star ratings are essentially meaningless and therefore any change from year to year is also meaningless .
i am a doctor proud to work as part of the nhs , and am happy to work hard to improve the quality of care given to my patients , hospital star ratings do not help .
andrew brooks , derby , uk i feel very saddened by the ' 1 star ' grading of my local hospital , west suffolk .
it 's been struggling financially for a long while , but during the two operations i 've had in the last couple of years i 've received nothing but the highest standards of care .
it seems to me that sometimes financial and patient-care related targets are mutually exclusive .
david edwards , bury st edmunds , suffolk the trouble with performance indicators is that the government are continually changing the goalposts and changing priorities .
another major hurdle all trusts have had to jump was changing was in pay modernisation .
an inordinately large proportion of time has been given by all staff groups to the detriment of patient care .
the vast majority of staff within the nhs works well in excess of their contracted hours just to keep pace with government demands .
the government should back off and give all trusts time and adequate resources to meet what 's expected of them .
j , middlesbrough uk before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed amanda jenkinson , west midlands i think rating hospitals is like rating hotels .
mmsr has a large impact , and the government are simply not funding enough for housekeeping staff to clean the hospitals as they should be .
being a support service assistant myself , i can see where the problems are .
doctors and nurses are stretched .
so before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed .
amanda jenkinson , west midlands having previously worked for the nhs it does not surprise me that hospitals are losing stars .
money is spent on non-essential items instead of medical equipment .
staff would complain at meetings if biscuits were not provided with the tea and coffee and expensive venues were often used to hold the meetings .
many non-medical departments are now based in plush office blocks rather than in the hospitals themselves .
one department , which has only been created for one year for a particular project , has a newly refurbished office and furniture which could not be described as basic .
it is shocking that the nhs can spend money on luxury offices and biscuits for stuffy men in suits when they are already overspending and under performing .
anon , london the health watchdog has said targets are harder this year and ' the overall improvement in performance this year should not be underestimated . '
the disgrace is the headlines saying ' fewer 3 star hospitals ' .
why must the media always try and find failure in success ?
will rossetti , bristol , uk nothing like a good old league table to deplete the morale of thousands of doctors , nurses and nhs staff who work so hard everyday .
has anyone been in an nhs hospital recently ?
the improvement in recent years is staggering .
the standards the government have set are sometimes unreasonable high ; this does n't mean a hospital is ' bad . '
alex , cambridge the star ratings are a farce - my local nhs trust was recently the subject of a panorama special on hospital cleanliness yet it still achieves a pass rating - how can this be ?
stuart hadley , birmingham , uk i am pleased both of my local hospitals have a 3 star status .
however the system will only get better everywhere else when hospitals invest in more support staff instead of wasting millions on a huge senior management structure .
simon young , essex the government requires trust to achieve targets to convince the public that the nhs service is improving .
i am sure that we can see without the targets .
get rid of the targets and audit measurements and use the money in the nhs .
this is a free service , we do n't even pay to visit the doctor !
the public 's expectations of our nhs is far too high .
we have more people using the service than 10 years ago .
what do people expect ?
there is not enough tax paid to fund the large increase in its use .
the nhs will require higher funding from joe public 's purse .
if you want a better health service then you will have to pay at one end or the other .
myself i prefer higher taxes .
jeanette , northampton i 'm still struggling to lower my anger than i had to endure a 3 day traumatic labour before finally needing a c-section under general anaesthetic . because i am lead to believe that my nhs authorities stats for c-sections was already over quota .
i do n't care whether it 's down to finances or hospital management but things like this should not be allowed to happen and both sides should stop blaming each other and instead concentrate together to achieve a better outcome than is clear from the results that have come through today .
sharlie , oxfordshire the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct tony , grays , uk working within an nhs trust , i can tell you that everyone is working as hard as possible to ensure the highest level of care possible is achieved .
it 's easy for people to criticise the poor standards , but in recent years the nhs has started to turn around after almost two decades of severe under-funding by prior governments .
the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct , which i can say with confidence , is what everyone working here wants .
tony , grays , uk i am a qualified nurse , i can honestly say that i have given 100 % on every shift i have worked since qualifying in 1998 .
i genuinely care for all my patients , even the ones that swear , bite and scratch .
i care for my patients as if they were my own family .
my passion for nursing is ebbing though when i come to work to be faced with more unrealistic targets stipulated by the government and to be told that we are now a zero rated trust because we were 2 % off one target out of eight .
where is the incentive to give quality nursing care when it is easier to cut corners to meet targets ?
p , leeds , uk the latest results have been published at a time when the public perception of hospital care is at an all-time low .
my hospital , king 's college in south london has lost its 3rd star simply as a result of finance .
the star ratings do not show to the general public the huge improvements made by dedicated and talented nhs staff .
the a & e department at king 's has been commended and shown as one of the best in the uk , and yet a star is still lost !
thank goodness the system is about to change !
dr , london uk the star ratings are a very crude and inaccurate tool indeed , and the amount of cheating / fudging possible to ensure hitting them is immense .
i think what we are seeing here is a combination of less cheating as loopholes are filled , plus chronic under funding becoming impossible to hide any more , and not actually any real degradation of our hospitals .
mark williams , grays , essex i just felt that i had to stick up for the nhs , as it does work well .
i think it needs modernising but i think the problem is too many managers that do n't really understand what the nhs actually stands for .
i would love to see more managers actually having more nursing experience as then they would have a better understanding of what it is like to work in the environment itself . the staff shortages , the shortages of basic equipment i.e hoists , handling belts , to simple things like soap and other toiletries .
however the nurses and other nursing staff do their best , and we experienced this when my father-in-law was operated on and back onto the ward within 3 hours of him going to a + e. the care he received was great .
these ' stars ' are n't a good thing in my opinion - who has the right to be judgemental like that ?
in my opinion it should be the service users themselves i.e the patients and their relatives - if there is a problem , let the staff know .
danni , ipswich , uk the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort s , newcastle as an a & e doctor , i can tell you that the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort .
nobody on the coal face pays any attention to them .
the a & e waiting time is a complete joke .
the times are falsified in order to meet the targets , and patients are moved from a & e , against the advice of clinicians , by the managers .
the managers are not accountable to anyone but themselves and make decisions that could adversely affect patient outcomes .
the star rating system has been corrupt since its inception as the chief execs and middle managers focus on the targets that will get them points , at the expense of genuine clinical need .
as we know , points make prizes -lrb- or in this case stars -rrb- .
s , newcastle the majority of health services are delivering really tough targets .
i think that taking services down to a local or regional level does create differences in how health services perform , but perhaps that is an issue about local accountability- and perhaps the public bothering to hold local health chiefs accountable .
it 's important to understand that the nhs was close to collapse a decade ago .
in under 10 years it 's got miles better - not perfect , but then nobody has a magic wand .

an inordinately large proportion of time has been given by all staff groups to the detriment of patient care .
the vast majority of staff within the nhs works well in excess of their contracted hours just to keep pace with government demands .
the government should back off and give all trusts time and adequate resources to meet what 's expected of them .
j , middlesbrough uk before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed amanda jenkinson , west midlands i think rating hospitals is like rating hotels .
mmsr has a large impact , and the government are simply not funding enough for housekeeping staff to clean the hospitals as they should be .
being a support service assistant myself , i can see where the problems are .
doctors and nurses are stretched .
so before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed .
amanda jenkinson , west midlands having previously worked for the nhs it does not surprise me that hospitals are losing stars .
money is spent on non-essential items instead of medical equipment .
staff would complain at meetings if biscuits were not provided with the tea and coffee and expensive venues were often used to hold the meetings .
many non-medical departments are now based in plush office blocks rather than in the hospitals themselves .
one department , which has only been created for one year for a particular project , has a newly refurbished office and furniture which could not be described as basic .
it is shocking that the nhs can spend money on luxury offices and biscuits for stuffy men in suits when they are already overspending and under performing .
anon , london the health watchdog has said targets are harder this year and ' the overall improvement in performance this year should not be underestimated . '
the disgrace is the headlines saying ' fewer 3 star hospitals ' .
why must the media always try and find failure in success ?
will rossetti , bristol , uk nothing like a good old league table to deplete the morale of thousands of doctors , nurses and nhs staff who work so hard everyday .
has anyone been in an nhs hospital recently ?
the improvement in recent years is staggering .
the standards the government have set are sometimes unreasonable high ; this does n't mean a hospital is ' bad . '
alex , cambridge the star ratings are a farce - my local nhs trust was recently the subject of a panorama special on hospital cleanliness yet it still achieves a pass rating - how can this be ?
stuart hadley , birmingham , uk i am pleased both of my local hospitals have a 3 star status .
however the system will only get better everywhere else when hospitals invest in more support staff instead of wasting millions on a huge senior management structure .
simon young , essex the government requires trust to achieve targets to convince the public that the nhs service is improving .
i am sure that we can see without the targets .
get rid of the targets and audit measurements and use the money in the nhs .
this is a free service , we do n't even pay to visit the doctor !
the public 's expectations of our nhs is far too high .
we have more people using the service than 10 years ago .
what do people expect ?
there is not enough tax paid to fund the large increase in its use .
the nhs will require higher funding from joe public 's purse .
if you want a better health service then you will have to pay at one end or the other .
myself i prefer higher taxes .
jeanette , northampton i 'm still struggling to lower my anger than i had to endure a 3 day traumatic labour before finally needing a c-section under general anaesthetic . because i am lead to believe that my nhs authorities stats for c-sections was already over quota .
i do n't care whether it 's down to finances or hospital management but things like this should not be allowed to happen and both sides should stop blaming each other and instead concentrate together to achieve a better outcome than is clear from the results that have come through today .
sharlie , oxfordshire the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct tony , grays , uk working within an nhs trust , i can tell you that everyone is working as hard as possible to ensure the highest level of care possible is achieved .
it 's easy for people to criticise the poor standards , but in recent years the nhs has started to turn around after almost two decades of severe under-funding by prior governments .
the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct , which i can say with confidence , is what everyone working here wants .
tony , grays , uk i am a qualified nurse , i can honestly say that i have given 100 % on every shift i have worked since qualifying in 1998 .
i genuinely care for all my patients , even the ones that swear , bite and scratch .
i care for my patients as if they were my own family .
my passion for nursing is ebbing though when i come to work to be faced with more unrealistic targets stipulated by the government and to be told that we are now a zero rated trust because we were 2 % off one target out of eight .
where is the incentive to give quality nursing care when it is easier to cut corners to meet targets ?
p , leeds , uk the latest results have been published at a time when the public perception of hospital care is at an all-time low .
my hospital , king 's college in south london has lost its 3rd star simply as a result of finance .
the star ratings do not show to the general public the huge improvements made by dedicated and talented nhs staff .
the a & e department at king 's has been commended and shown as one of the best in the uk , and yet a star is still lost !
thank goodness the system is about to change !
dr , london uk the star ratings are a very crude and inaccurate tool indeed , and the amount of cheating / fudging possible to ensure hitting them is immense .
i think what we are seeing here is a combination of less cheating as loopholes are filled , plus chronic under funding becoming impossible to hide any more , and not actually any real degradation of our hospitals .
mark williams , grays , essex i just felt that i had to stick up for the nhs , as it does work well .
i think it needs modernising but i think the problem is too many managers that do n't really understand what the nhs actually stands for .
i would love to see more managers actually having more nursing experience as then they would have a better understanding of what it is like to work in the environment itself . the staff shortages , the shortages of basic equipment i.e hoists , handling belts , to simple things like soap and other toiletries .
however the nurses and other nursing staff do their best , and we experienced this when my father-in-law was operated on and back onto the ward within 3 hours of him going to a + e. the care he received was great .
these ' stars ' are n't a good thing in my opinion - who has the right to be judgemental like that ?
in my opinion it should be the service users themselves i.e the patients and their relatives - if there is a problem , let the staff know .
danni , ipswich , uk the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort s , newcastle as an a & e doctor , i can tell you that the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort .
nobody on the coal face pays any attention to them .
the a & e waiting time is a complete joke .
the times are falsified in order to meet the targets , and patients are moved from a & e , against the advice of clinicians , by the managers .
the managers are not accountable to anyone but themselves and make decisions that could adversely affect patient outcomes .
the star rating system has been corrupt since its inception as the chief execs and middle managers focus on the targets that will get them points , at the expense of genuine clinical need .
as we know , points make prizes -lrb- or in this case stars -rrb- .
s , newcastle the majority of health services are delivering really tough targets .
i think that taking services down to a local or regional level does create differences in how health services perform , but perhaps that is an issue about local accountability- and perhaps the public bothering to hold local health chiefs accountable .
it 's important to understand that the nhs was close to collapse a decade ago .
in under 10 years it 's got miles better - not perfect , but then nobody has a magic wand .
i 'm diabetic and the improved service just so far will add years to my life .
chris , london i am delighted to hear that mansfield district primary care trust has retained its 3 star status of excellence .
i have been overwhelmingly pleased by the level of care provided by them over the past three years of my illness .
all the staff based at ransom hall also deserve a round of applause for their commitment to improving services .
well done mansfield district michael jones , mansfield , uk these results show that it is pointless for the government to pour increasing amounts of taxpayers ' money into the national health service before a radical change in management and structure is introduced .
as evidenced in brighton recently in the panorama tv programme filmed in the old people 's ward , top management is unaccountable , anarchy seems to prevail , wards are still filthy , patients are n't cared for - the list is endless .
all this proves that targets are pointless as they only gloss over the rotten foundations .
tony ellis , northwood , england i think it 's absolutely disgusting , the government has nagged on about this being a high priority yet things get worse .
my partner is pregnant and the three hospitals near us in south london have all received poor results , this coupled with the terrible results regarding mrsa on these hospitals has made us decide on a home birth .
i am losing complete faith in our local hospitals to provide a satisfactory service .
the last thing you want to worry about is someone coming out worse than when they went in .
andrew daw , london does the last comment by andrew daw not prove that the star ratings are considered and used by the public .
by choosing a home birth then this couple have opted not to use an acute hospital with a low star rating and instead opted for the home birth with a community mid-wife who will be part of the nhs and attached to -lrb- possibly -rrb- a better performing trust or pct .

this year fewer hospitals in england have received three stars - the top rating - in the health commission 's annual survey .
it 's the first time standards have fallen in four years .
problems with finances and government targets are being blamed .
but primary care , mental health and the ambulance trust have improved , according to the nhs watchdog .
nhs star ratings are to be scrapped - from next year , trusts will be asked to produce annual self-assessments and there will random spot checks on trusts with problems .
what is your experience of nhs hospitals ?
is the star rating system fair ?
what can be done to improve hospitals ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by alison , uk hospitals are allegedly failing to reach certain targets and have , therefore , lost " stars " .
should the government stop setting targets and allow the hospitals to have more autonomy to improve patient care ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates i think the nhs needs to stop appointing nurses and medical staff to managerial positions .
nursing staff are very good at nursing but they are not trained to manage a business .
properly trained managerial staff would be able to manage the business of running a hospital and control the finances .
there are far too many managers in the nhs and by employing a few less managers , and more front line staff then they will be able to do the jobs that actually help hospitals to run every day lucy , uk if people were cans of beans and we all were in supermarkets then i could understand the star rating system because everyone would be the same .
however we are not .
the star rating system is a simplistic and meaningless way of assessing services , just like school league tables .
they are there for the consumption of ' middle england ' and the sound bite politics and journalism we are fed through the media .
here in stoke we have a fantastic hospital with dedicated and hardworking professionals who are doing more with fewer resources and as their rating has fallen they will be in line for yet another rubbishing by the media .
all i want to say is well done you are all stars ...
10 stars that is .
robert fair , staffs having just received treatment for a mild heart attack in fairfield general hospital , bury .
i have nothing but praise for the team in coronary care unit .
i am not surprised that some hospitals are suffering because these days there are too many chiefs in the nhs .
maybe if the cut back on all the unnecessary departments and got back to basics the nhs would be in a better state .
i work within the nhs for a supplier and i know the hassle the staff have to go through to sometimes get basic equipment .
w shepherd , bolton i think that the nhs needs to pay more attention to their management .
managers within the nhs appear to be promoted through their ranks and lack basic management skills .
this results in a waste of resources , money and mismanagement of staff , particularly at the lower grades .
doug powell , london the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients anon , uk the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients .
i would always prefer to wait and see a doctor who actually is an expert than see an inferior / failed doctor instantly i walk into a hospital .
i work in a zero rated university teaching hospital but my department has an international reputation for excellence .
everyone who works in the nhs knows that these rating schemes never measure the things that really matter but are management games .
anon , uk i have been in and out of hospital quite a few times over the last three years and i have had nothing but wonderful service from paramedics , doctors , nurses , and staff less recognised like cleaners .
they have all given me a high standard of care , been incredibly compassionate and kind , and made me feel a whole less frightened by the whole experience .
there is too much talk of low ' star ' service , so i want to take this time to thank all those in the nhs service for everything they have done for me and my loved ones .
you do a great job , guys !
nicole , london i think the nhs is appalling .
i went in to have a lymph node removed and tested last year and came out with a terrible hip infection after i had been operated on .
the lymph node came back clear but i left hospital sicker than when i went in .
sharon , london the national health service is outdated and obsolete .
the limited government resources need to be focused on the poorest in our society , everyone else should be expected to pay for their own healthcare .
s. gordon , edinburgh as a nurse of 28yrs in the nhs i am increasingly fearful of our service and ability to deliver to forever increasing government targets .
whilst trying to achieve these we are losing sight of the needs of the patient .
we do n't have the time to spend with them we ca n't sit and hear what they are saying , we ca n't deliver the care we know they need ... why ?
no staff , no resources , constant constraint , persistent relentless government initiatives , etc .
we are in serious danger of no longer knowing what it is we are trying to do and losing sight of what 's important ... patient care .
as far as i am concerned the star rating system should be scrapped it sends the wrong message to the public , takes too much time away from more pressing matters and demoralises the staff of the nhs .
ea , west yorks i currently work in nhs management and i would like to take issue with the comment that managers do n't understand what the nhs stands for .
i joined this organisation so that i could put my skills to use for the good of patient care , rather than for the good of profits .
the nhs is in general staffed by people in all departments , not just clinical but management alike , who have a genuine desire to improve the patient experience .
the nhs has its faults like all organisations , but in general strives to provide the best service it can within its budgetary constraints , something that all the negative media surrounding it does n't help to remind people of .
olive , sheffield not where i live in north bristol , they are going up .
all my experiences with the nhs here have been excellent .
the only thing the local hospital failed on was the 4-hour time limit at a & e. seems to me the important thing about a & e is that people who need to be seen quickly are seen , while those who are able to wait wait .
tom , britsol the star system is a pointless exercise .
it does not accurately reflect how good or bad any hospital is .
hospitals currently only focus on the target , and not on the individual patients .
decisions are often made in a way that compromises patient care , in some cases prioritising a long-waiting routine list case over an emergency admission .
the only progress they produce is in the ability of management to manipulate the data .
robert crowder , todmorden , uk living in thurrock i have to travel 20 miles to my nearest a & e department .
with all these people proposing to build all these houses in thurrock would it not be better to build another hospital first , it is not fair to expect basildon to cope with all the people it will bring in .
denise , south ockendon , essex i wish people would stop complaining about the nhs , the service is 100 times better than the useless health service and doctors in holland -lrb- and you have to pay a lot more over here -rrb- it is so bad , i do n't even bother to go to doctors here anymore as they do nothing at all .
the nhs do the best they can and is probably the best health service in the world , we should be proud of it instead of always complaining .
ian purnell , maastricht holland it needs to be stated that these targets are government set and the role of the trust and health authority managers -lrb- of which i am one -rrb- is to ensure they are successfully achieved .
the causal effect of their implementation however is a resource -lrb- financial and human -rrb- commitment by the trust to achieving them which by implication draws resource away from other clinical areas .
this central direction is not well liked by trusts as it usurps local trust direction but is in direct response to public concern over high profile issues .
however , these results should be treated as indicative rather than definitive .
bob barr , london , uk my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic p , leicester as a nurse i have to echo the comments of the a & e doctor , the star system is corrupt .
the trust i work for got its 3 stars , to no ones surprise at all .
we had advance warning of the inspection , even their precise route through the hospital .
needless to say that route was spotless when the peat team arrived , having been attended to by more cleaners than on any normal day .
my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic .
p , leicester so , under the tories we had low taxes and poor hospitals .
under new labour we have high taxes and . poor hospitals .
of those two i think i prefer the former .
matt f , bristol , uk bean counters count beans , not quality .
just because something is measurable does not necessarily mean it is important .
the star ratings are essentially meaningless and therefore any change from year to year is also meaningless .
i am a doctor proud to work as part of the nhs , and am happy to work hard to improve the quality of care given to my patients , hospital star ratings do not help .
andrew brooks , derby , uk i feel very saddened by the ' 1 star ' grading of my local hospital , west suffolk .
it 's been struggling financially for a long while , but during the two operations i 've had in the last couple of years i 've received nothing but the highest standards of care .
it seems to me that sometimes financial and patient-care related targets are mutually exclusive .

i am not surprised that some hospitals are suffering because these days there are too many chiefs in the nhs .
maybe if the cut back on all the unnecessary departments and got back to basics the nhs would be in a better state .
i work within the nhs for a supplier and i know the hassle the staff have to go through to sometimes get basic equipment .
w shepherd , bolton i think that the nhs needs to pay more attention to their management .
managers within the nhs appear to be promoted through their ranks and lack basic management skills .
this results in a waste of resources , money and mismanagement of staff , particularly at the lower grades .
doug powell , london the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients anon , uk the rating scheme is not an indicator of good scientific or clinical care of patients .
i would always prefer to wait and see a doctor who actually is an expert than see an inferior / failed doctor instantly i walk into a hospital .
i work in a zero rated university teaching hospital but my department has an international reputation for excellence .
everyone who works in the nhs knows that these rating schemes never measure the things that really matter but are management games .
anon , uk i have been in and out of hospital quite a few times over the last three years and i have had nothing but wonderful service from paramedics , doctors , nurses , and staff less recognised like cleaners .
they have all given me a high standard of care , been incredibly compassionate and kind , and made me feel a whole less frightened by the whole experience .
there is too much talk of low ' star ' service , so i want to take this time to thank all those in the nhs service for everything they have done for me and my loved ones .
you do a great job , guys !
nicole , london i think the nhs is appalling .
i went in to have a lymph node removed and tested last year and came out with a terrible hip infection after i had been operated on .
the lymph node came back clear but i left hospital sicker than when i went in .
sharon , london the national health service is outdated and obsolete .
the limited government resources need to be focused on the poorest in our society , everyone else should be expected to pay for their own healthcare .
s. gordon , edinburgh as a nurse of 28yrs in the nhs i am increasingly fearful of our service and ability to deliver to forever increasing government targets .
whilst trying to achieve these we are losing sight of the needs of the patient .
we do n't have the time to spend with them we ca n't sit and hear what they are saying , we ca n't deliver the care we know they need ... why ?
no staff , no resources , constant constraint , persistent relentless government initiatives , etc .
we are in serious danger of no longer knowing what it is we are trying to do and losing sight of what 's important ... patient care .
as far as i am concerned the star rating system should be scrapped it sends the wrong message to the public , takes too much time away from more pressing matters and demoralises the staff of the nhs .
ea , west yorks i currently work in nhs management and i would like to take issue with the comment that managers do n't understand what the nhs stands for .
i joined this organisation so that i could put my skills to use for the good of patient care , rather than for the good of profits .
the nhs is in general staffed by people in all departments , not just clinical but management alike , who have a genuine desire to improve the patient experience .
the nhs has its faults like all organisations , but in general strives to provide the best service it can within its budgetary constraints , something that all the negative media surrounding it does n't help to remind people of .
olive , sheffield not where i live in north bristol , they are going up .
all my experiences with the nhs here have been excellent .
the only thing the local hospital failed on was the 4-hour time limit at a & e. seems to me the important thing about a & e is that people who need to be seen quickly are seen , while those who are able to wait wait .
tom , britsol the star system is a pointless exercise .
it does not accurately reflect how good or bad any hospital is .
hospitals currently only focus on the target , and not on the individual patients .
decisions are often made in a way that compromises patient care , in some cases prioritising a long-waiting routine list case over an emergency admission .
the only progress they produce is in the ability of management to manipulate the data .
robert crowder , todmorden , uk living in thurrock i have to travel 20 miles to my nearest a & e department .
with all these people proposing to build all these houses in thurrock would it not be better to build another hospital first , it is not fair to expect basildon to cope with all the people it will bring in .
denise , south ockendon , essex i wish people would stop complaining about the nhs , the service is 100 times better than the useless health service and doctors in holland -lrb- and you have to pay a lot more over here -rrb- it is so bad , i do n't even bother to go to doctors here anymore as they do nothing at all .
the nhs do the best they can and is probably the best health service in the world , we should be proud of it instead of always complaining .
ian purnell , maastricht holland it needs to be stated that these targets are government set and the role of the trust and health authority managers -lrb- of which i am one -rrb- is to ensure they are successfully achieved .
the causal effect of their implementation however is a resource -lrb- financial and human -rrb- commitment by the trust to achieving them which by implication draws resource away from other clinical areas .
this central direction is not well liked by trusts as it usurps local trust direction but is in direct response to public concern over high profile issues .
however , these results should be treated as indicative rather than definitive .
bob barr , london , uk my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic p , leicester as a nurse i have to echo the comments of the a & e doctor , the star system is corrupt .
the trust i work for got its 3 stars , to no ones surprise at all .
we had advance warning of the inspection , even their precise route through the hospital .
needless to say that route was spotless when the peat team arrived , having been attended to by more cleaners than on any normal day .
my ward had a squad of cleaners on duty for the days leading up to the inspection , the next day reverting back to its one part-time domestic .
p , leicester so , under the tories we had low taxes and poor hospitals .
under new labour we have high taxes and . poor hospitals .
of those two i think i prefer the former .
matt f , bristol , uk bean counters count beans , not quality .
just because something is measurable does not necessarily mean it is important .
the star ratings are essentially meaningless and therefore any change from year to year is also meaningless .
i am a doctor proud to work as part of the nhs , and am happy to work hard to improve the quality of care given to my patients , hospital star ratings do not help .
andrew brooks , derby , uk i feel very saddened by the ' 1 star ' grading of my local hospital , west suffolk .
it 's been struggling financially for a long while , but during the two operations i 've had in the last couple of years i 've received nothing but the highest standards of care .
it seems to me that sometimes financial and patient-care related targets are mutually exclusive .
david edwards , bury st edmunds , suffolk the trouble with performance indicators is that the government are continually changing the goalposts and changing priorities .
another major hurdle all trusts have had to jump was changing was in pay modernisation .
an inordinately large proportion of time has been given by all staff groups to the detriment of patient care .
the vast majority of staff within the nhs works well in excess of their contracted hours just to keep pace with government demands .
the government should back off and give all trusts time and adequate resources to meet what 's expected of them .
j , middlesbrough uk before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed amanda jenkinson , west midlands i think rating hospitals is like rating hotels .
mmsr has a large impact , and the government are simply not funding enough for housekeeping staff to clean the hospitals as they should be .
being a support service assistant myself , i can see where the problems are .
doctors and nurses are stretched .
so before they give star ratings they should put funding where it is needed .
amanda jenkinson , west midlands having previously worked for the nhs it does not surprise me that hospitals are losing stars .
money is spent on non-essential items instead of medical equipment .
staff would complain at meetings if biscuits were not provided with the tea and coffee and expensive venues were often used to hold the meetings .
many non-medical departments are now based in plush office blocks rather than in the hospitals themselves .
one department , which has only been created for one year for a particular project , has a newly refurbished office and furniture which could not be described as basic .
it is shocking that the nhs can spend money on luxury offices and biscuits for stuffy men in suits when they are already overspending and under performing .
anon , london the health watchdog has said targets are harder this year and ' the overall improvement in performance this year should not be underestimated . '
the disgrace is the headlines saying ' fewer 3 star hospitals ' .
why must the media always try and find failure in success ?
will rossetti , bristol , uk nothing like a good old league table to deplete the morale of thousands of doctors , nurses and nhs staff who work so hard everyday .
has anyone been in an nhs hospital recently ?
the improvement in recent years is staggering .
the standards the government have set are sometimes unreasonable high ; this does n't mean a hospital is ' bad . '
alex , cambridge the star ratings are a farce - my local nhs trust was recently the subject of a panorama special on hospital cleanliness yet it still achieves a pass rating - how can this be ?
stuart hadley , birmingham , uk i am pleased both of my local hospitals have a 3 star status .
however the system will only get better everywhere else when hospitals invest in more support staff instead of wasting millions on a huge senior management structure .
simon young , essex the government requires trust to achieve targets to convince the public that the nhs service is improving .
i am sure that we can see without the targets .
get rid of the targets and audit measurements and use the money in the nhs .
this is a free service , we do n't even pay to visit the doctor !
the public 's expectations of our nhs is far too high .
we have more people using the service than 10 years ago .
what do people expect ?
there is not enough tax paid to fund the large increase in its use .
the nhs will require higher funding from joe public 's purse .
if you want a better health service then you will have to pay at one end or the other .
myself i prefer higher taxes .
jeanette , northampton i 'm still struggling to lower my anger than i had to endure a 3 day traumatic labour before finally needing a c-section under general anaesthetic . because i am lead to believe that my nhs authorities stats for c-sections was already over quota .
i do n't care whether it 's down to finances or hospital management but things like this should not be allowed to happen and both sides should stop blaming each other and instead concentrate together to achieve a better outcome than is clear from the results that have come through today .
sharlie , oxfordshire the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct tony , grays , uk working within an nhs trust , i can tell you that everyone is working as hard as possible to ensure the highest level of care possible is achieved .
it 's easy for people to criticise the poor standards , but in recent years the nhs has started to turn around after almost two decades of severe under-funding by prior governments .
the problems within the nhs are going to take time and effort to correct , which i can say with confidence , is what everyone working here wants .
tony , grays , uk i am a qualified nurse , i can honestly say that i have given 100 % on every shift i have worked since qualifying in 1998 .
i genuinely care for all my patients , even the ones that swear , bite and scratch .
i care for my patients as if they were my own family .
my passion for nursing is ebbing though when i come to work to be faced with more unrealistic targets stipulated by the government and to be told that we are now a zero rated trust because we were 2 % off one target out of eight .
where is the incentive to give quality nursing care when it is easier to cut corners to meet targets ?
p , leeds , uk the latest results have been published at a time when the public perception of hospital care is at an all-time low .
my hospital , king 's college in south london has lost its 3rd star simply as a result of finance .
the star ratings do not show to the general public the huge improvements made by dedicated and talented nhs staff .
the a & e department at king 's has been commended and shown as one of the best in the uk , and yet a star is still lost !
thank goodness the system is about to change !
dr , london uk the star ratings are a very crude and inaccurate tool indeed , and the amount of cheating / fudging possible to ensure hitting them is immense .
i think what we are seeing here is a combination of less cheating as loopholes are filled , plus chronic under funding becoming impossible to hide any more , and not actually any real degradation of our hospitals .
mark williams , grays , essex i just felt that i had to stick up for the nhs , as it does work well .
i think it needs modernising but i think the problem is too many managers that do n't really understand what the nhs actually stands for .
i would love to see more managers actually having more nursing experience as then they would have a better understanding of what it is like to work in the environment itself . the staff shortages , the shortages of basic equipment i.e hoists , handling belts , to simple things like soap and other toiletries .
however the nurses and other nursing staff do their best , and we experienced this when my father-in-law was operated on and back onto the ward within 3 hours of him going to a + e. the care he received was great .
these ' stars ' are n't a good thing in my opinion - who has the right to be judgemental like that ?
in my opinion it should be the service users themselves i.e the patients and their relatives - if there is a problem , let the staff know .
danni , ipswich , uk the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort s , newcastle as an a & e doctor , i can tell you that the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort .
nobody on the coal face pays any attention to them .
the a & e waiting time is a complete joke .
the times are falsified in order to meet the targets , and patients are moved from a & e , against the advice of clinicians , by the managers .
the managers are not accountable to anyone but themselves and make decisions that could adversely affect patient outcomes .
the star rating system has been corrupt since its inception as the chief execs and middle managers focus on the targets that will get them points , at the expense of genuine clinical need .
as we know , points make prizes -lrb- or in this case stars -rrb- .
s , newcastle the majority of health services are delivering really tough targets .
i think that taking services down to a local or regional level does create differences in how health services perform , but perhaps that is an issue about local accountability- and perhaps the public bothering to hold local health chiefs accountable .
it 's important to understand that the nhs was close to collapse a decade ago .
in under 10 years it 's got miles better - not perfect , but then nobody has a magic wand .
i 'm diabetic and the improved service just so far will add years to my life .
chris , london i am delighted to hear that mansfield district primary care trust has retained its 3 star status of excellence .
i have been overwhelmingly pleased by the level of care provided by them over the past three years of my illness .
all the staff based at ransom hall also deserve a round of applause for their commitment to improving services .
well done mansfield district michael jones , mansfield , uk these results show that it is pointless for the government to pour increasing amounts of taxpayers ' money into the national health service before a radical change in management and structure is introduced .
as evidenced in brighton recently in the panorama tv programme filmed in the old people 's ward , top management is unaccountable , anarchy seems to prevail , wards are still filthy , patients are n't cared for - the list is endless .
all this proves that targets are pointless as they only gloss over the rotten foundations .
tony ellis , northwood , england i think it 's absolutely disgusting , the government has nagged on about this being a high priority yet things get worse .
my partner is pregnant and the three hospitals near us in south london have all received poor results , this coupled with the terrible results regarding mrsa on these hospitals has made us decide on a home birth .
i am losing complete faith in our local hospitals to provide a satisfactory service .
the last thing you want to worry about is someone coming out worse than when they went in .
andrew daw , london does the last comment by andrew daw not prove that the star ratings are considered and used by the public .
by choosing a home birth then this couple have opted not to use an acute hospital with a low star rating and instead opted for the home birth with a community mid-wife who will be part of the nhs and attached to -lrb- possibly -rrb- a better performing trust or pct .

this year fewer hospitals in england have received three stars - the top rating - in the health commission 's annual survey .
it 's the first time standards have fallen in four years .
problems with finances and government targets are being blamed .
but primary care , mental health and the ambulance trust have improved , according to the nhs watchdog .
nhs star ratings are to be scrapped - from next year , trusts will be asked to produce annual self-assessments and there will random spot checks on trusts with problems .
what is your experience of nhs hospitals ?
is the star rating system fair ?
what can be done to improve hospitals ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : suggest a debate this topic was suggested by alison , uk hospitals are allegedly failing to reach certain targets and have , therefore , lost " stars " .
should the government stop setting targets and allow the hospitals to have more autonomy to improve patient care ?
send us your suggestions for have your say debates i think the nhs needs to stop appointing nurses and medical staff to managerial positions .
nursing staff are very good at nursing but they are not trained to manage a business .
properly trained managerial staff would be able to manage the business of running a hospital and control the finances .
there are far too many managers in the nhs and by employing a few less managers , and more front line staff then they will be able to do the jobs that actually help hospitals to run every day lucy , uk if people were cans of beans and we all were in supermarkets then i could understand the star rating system because everyone would be the same .
however we are not .
the star rating system is a simplistic and meaningless way of assessing services , just like school league tables .
they are there for the consumption of ' middle england ' and the sound bite politics and journalism we are fed through the media .
here in stoke we have a fantastic hospital with dedicated and hardworking professionals who are doing more with fewer resources and as their rating has fallen they will be in line for yet another rubbishing by the media .
all i want to say is well done you are all stars ...
10 stars that is .

i think it needs modernising but i think the problem is too many managers that do n't really understand what the nhs actually stands for .
i would love to see more managers actually having more nursing experience as then they would have a better understanding of what it is like to work in the environment itself . the staff shortages , the shortages of basic equipment i.e hoists , handling belts , to simple things like soap and other toiletries .
however the nurses and other nursing staff do their best , and we experienced this when my father-in-law was operated on and back onto the ward within 3 hours of him going to a + e. the care he received was great .
these ' stars ' are n't a good thing in my opinion - who has the right to be judgemental like that ?
in my opinion it should be the service users themselves i.e the patients and their relatives - if there is a problem , let the staff know .
danni , ipswich , uk the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort s , newcastle as an a & e doctor , i can tell you that the star ratings are a complete waste of time and effort .
nobody on the coal face pays any attention to them .
the a & e waiting time is a complete joke .
the times are falsified in order to meet the targets , and patients are moved from a & e , against the advice of clinicians , by the managers .
the managers are not accountable to anyone but themselves and make decisions that could adversely affect patient outcomes .
the star rating system has been corrupt since its inception as the chief execs and middle managers focus on the targets that will get them points , at the expense of genuine clinical need .
as we know , points make prizes -lrb- or in this case stars -rrb- .
s , newcastle the majority of health services are delivering really tough targets .
i think that taking services down to a local or regional level does create differences in how health services perform , but perhaps that is an issue about local accountability- and perhaps the public bothering to hold local health chiefs accountable .
it 's important to understand that the nhs was close to collapse a decade ago .
in under 10 years it 's got miles better - not perfect , but then nobody has a magic wand .
i 'm diabetic and the improved service just so far will add years to my life .
chris , london i am delighted to hear that mansfield district primary care trust has retained its 3 star status of excellence .
i have been overwhelmingly pleased by the level of care provided by them over the past three years of my illness .
all the staff based at ransom hall also deserve a round of applause for their commitment to improving services .
well done mansfield district michael jones , mansfield , uk these results show that it is pointless for the government to pour increasing amounts of taxpayers ' money into the national health service before a radical change in management and structure is introduced .
as evidenced in brighton recently in the panorama tv programme filmed in the old people 's ward , top management is unaccountable , anarchy seems to prevail , wards are still filthy , patients are n't cared for - the list is endless .
all this proves that targets are pointless as they only gloss over the rotten foundations .
tony ellis , northwood , england i think it 's absolutely disgusting , the government has nagged on about this being a high priority yet things get worse .
my partner is pregnant and the three hospitals near us in south london have all received poor results , this coupled with the terrible results regarding mrsa on these hospitals has made us decide on a home birth .
i am losing complete faith in our local hospitals to provide a satisfactory service .
the last thing you want to worry about is someone coming out worse than when they went in .
andrew daw , london does the last comment by andrew daw not prove that the star ratings are considered and used by the public .
by choosing a home birth then this couple have opted not to use an acute hospital with a low star rating and instead opted for the home birth with a community mid-wife who will be part of the nhs and attached to -lrb- possibly -rrb- a better performing trust or pct .

the station was damaged when a bomb was set off on a circle line train , killing six people .
district line trains are running again but the circle line remains suspended .
there are still restrictions to the hammersmith & city line .
platforms and trains at edgware road remained virtually empty during the usual morning rush hour .
some may have avoided the station , which showed no sign of the devastation caused by the blast , due to nerves while others were not aware it had reopened .
our job is to give confidence back to people howard collins , london underground carpenter william mascimento , from camden , north london , was one of just two people to take the 0705 bst train from edgware road to wimbledon .
the 22-year-old said : " i am worried , i will admit it - i just wo n't show it .
but at the same time i have got to get to work and carry on with everyday things . "
five workmates , who usually accompany him , opted to stay away from edgware road station and took alternative routes .
howard collins , london underground 's service director , said : " the reality is that obviously people are cautious but our job is to give confidence back to people , to work out the best way to ensure that london is a safe place to travel .
" our number one aim is to restore the service so that customers are confident the tube is running as before .
" we have had great support from london underground staff and metronet engineers who have worked round the clock to reopen edgware road station . "
' wo n't be defeated ' mr collins said he expected the station to be quiet on friday but that it would get busier when the hammersmith & city line opens on tuesday .
andrew lezala , chief executive of metronet - one of the private maintenance firms that maintain the london underground , said : " we 're determined to help get the capital back on its feet .
" londoners wo n't be defeated by the terrorists . "
engineers got the station repaired just eight days after it was handed back by the police .
police from the anti-terrorist branch gave back control of edgware road to london underground on 20 july , after the bombed carriage was lifted out by crane the previous night .
