the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome . " economic interests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder talk during their meeting in moscow on may 9 , 2005 khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .

the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .

" a global warming of two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- or more -lrb- by the year 2100 over pre-industrial levels -rrb- increases the likelihood of disastrous and irreversible damage . "
the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .

" never before has europe been so strong , so safe , so close to being united , " president aleksander kwasniewski of host nation poland said in a speech to open the summit , held in warsaw 's royal castle , which , like many landmarks in the polish capital , was rebuilt after being reduced to rubble in world war ii . " what better place than warsaw to organize the first ever summit of the whole of europe , " said the speaker of the council 's parliamentary council , rene van der linden .
" warsaw , a city which became the symbol of the horrors of world war ii ... a city that today welcomes a united europe for the first time in history , a europe united by the power of values , not the power of arms , " he said . portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country will take over the six-month chairmanship of the council from poland when the summit ends on tuesday , also praised europe 's oldest political organization , for its role in promoting human rights , in consolidating democracy and expanding the rule of law , which he called " the three main pillars of its activities . " " the political transformations that have been taking place in europe in the last decades demand more than ever a sustainable commitment to those values which reinforce our unity , " said socrates at the first plenary session - entitled " european values , european unity . "
a missing piece but amid all the praise , lithuanian leader valdas adamkus lithuanian president valdas adamkus reminded the gathering that a piece was missing in the puzzle of a united europe .
" the fact that european values have not won their way in belarus testifies to our joint failure , " adamkus said . " one european country is missing at this forum , a country whose citizens subscribe to the values of the council of europe , but who have been robbed of the opportunity to live by them . the alexander lukashenko regime is further isolating itself and the people of belarus from the family of free european nations and the values of democracy , " adamkus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' lukashenko lukashenko -lrb- photo -rrb- has been criticized in the west for the alleged systematic persecution of his political opponents , for rights abuses and for hampering freedom of the press .
belarus wants to join the 46-member council , which was founded in 1949 , four years after the end of world war ii . no room for lukashenko 's belarus a key role of the council since 1989 , when the berlin wall crumbled , has been to monitor human rights and rule of law in europe 's post-communist democracies .
last year , the council poured cold water on belarus 's membership ambitions , with its rapporteur on the persecution of the press in the country saying it " stands no foreseeable chance of being admitted . " french foreign minister michel barnier urged belarus " to make a vital effort " to gain membership to the council , which holds as its basic values democracy , rule of law and respect of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis council secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- alluded to the absence of belarus at the summit , saying " 46 out of 47 european countries " were members of the grouping .
davis , a former british lawmaker from the multi-ethnic birmingham constituency also urged summiteers to " campaign against the new evil of terrorism and the old evil of racism . " later monday , the summit participants , who included 22 european presidents and 13 prime ministers , were meant to sign conventions on the prevention of terrorism , human trafficking , and money laundering and the financing of terrorist acts .
then they must be ratified by individual countries ' parliaments and translated onto the statute books . the council 's parliamentary speaker , van der linden , urged summit participants to actively implement the conventions they would sign in warsaw , to ensure the future of the council and of europe .
" the decisions you are about to take will enable us to meet the challenges " of responding to european citizens ' needs , of working more closely with civil society , of erasing the dividing lines still evident in europe , he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw hosts pan-european summit sixty years after the end of world war ii , heads of state from 46 countries are meeting in warsaw for a pan-european summit to define future priorities in a new political mandate for the council of europe .

" " the political transformations that have been taking place in europe in the last decades demand more than ever a sustainable commitment to those values which reinforce our unity , " said socrates at the first plenary session - entitled " european values , european unity . "
a missing piece but amid all the praise , lithuanian leader valdas adamkus lithuanian president valdas adamkus reminded the gathering that a piece was missing in the puzzle of a united europe .
" the fact that european values have not won their way in belarus testifies to our joint failure , " adamkus said . " one european country is missing at this forum , a country whose citizens subscribe to the values of the council of europe , but who have been robbed of the opportunity to live by them . the alexander lukashenko regime is further isolating itself and the people of belarus from the family of free european nations and the values of democracy , " adamkus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' lukashenko lukashenko -lrb- photo -rrb- has been criticized in the west for the alleged systematic persecution of his political opponents , for rights abuses and for hampering freedom of the press .
belarus wants to join the 46-member council , which was founded in 1949 , four years after the end of world war ii . no room for lukashenko 's belarus a key role of the council since 1989 , when the berlin wall crumbled , has been to monitor human rights and rule of law in europe 's post-communist democracies .
last year , the council poured cold water on belarus 's membership ambitions , with its rapporteur on the persecution of the press in the country saying it " stands no foreseeable chance of being admitted . " french foreign minister michel barnier urged belarus " to make a vital effort " to gain membership to the council , which holds as its basic values democracy , rule of law and respect of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis council secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- alluded to the absence of belarus at the summit , saying " 46 out of 47 european countries " were members of the grouping .
davis , a former british lawmaker from the multi-ethnic birmingham constituency also urged summiteers to " campaign against the new evil of terrorism and the old evil of racism . " later monday , the summit participants , who included 22 european presidents and 13 prime ministers , were meant to sign conventions on the prevention of terrorism , human trafficking , and money laundering and the financing of terrorist acts .
then they must be ratified by individual countries ' parliaments and translated onto the statute books . the council 's parliamentary speaker , van der linden , urged summit participants to actively implement the conventions they would sign in warsaw , to ensure the future of the council and of europe .
" the decisions you are about to take will enable us to meet the challenges " of responding to european citizens ' needs , of working more closely with civil society , of erasing the dividing lines still evident in europe , he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw hosts pan-european summit sixty years after the end of world war ii , heads of state from 46 countries are meeting in warsaw for a pan-european summit to define future priorities in a new political mandate for the council of europe .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome . " economic interests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder talk during their meeting in moscow on may 9 , 2005 khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder implicated in kremlin intrigue after former yukos head mikhail khodorkovsky made his final statement in court monday , his lawyers accused gerhard schröder of complicity in the kremlin 's bid to eliminate dangerously independent tycoons .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome . " economic interests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder talk during their meeting in moscow on may 9 , 2005 khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder implicated in kremlin intrigue after former yukos head mikhail khodorkovsky made his final statement in court monday , his lawyers accused gerhard schröder of complicity in the kremlin 's bid to eliminate dangerously independent tycoons .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2005 eu : khodorkovsky case " internal affair " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax evader or political prisoner ?
the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome . " economic interests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder talk during their meeting in moscow on may 9 , 2005 khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder implicated in kremlin intrigue after former yukos head mikhail khodorkovsky made his final statement in court monday , his lawyers accused gerhard schröder of complicity in the kremlin 's bid to eliminate dangerously independent tycoons .
-lrb- april 13 , 2004 -rrb- verdict in yukos trial postponed the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed nations are supposed to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions the developed nations should take the lead in reducing pollution but developing nations must also consider how they could take part in the future without endangering economic growth .
kyoto just entered into force on february 16 after years of delays and was significantly weakened by the united states ' pullout .
nevertheless , kyoto supporters realize that future treaties can not be effective without the inclusion of the us .
" this is a global problem - we ca n't let the united states stay out , " said argentine environment minister gines gonzalez garcia .

one of europe 's most outspoken politicians in favor of the treaty is germany 's environment minister jürgen trittin .
" climate change is already a harsh reality , " the green party politician told delegates in bonn .
" a global warming of two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- or more -lrb- by the year 2100 over pre-industrial levels -rrb- increases the likelihood of disastrous and irreversible damage . "
the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .
also , a rush of freshwater into the north atlantic could shut down the gulf stream which is responsible for the temperate european climate .

" we desperately hope that the bush administration will wake up one day and understand that climate change is also threatening the us and the rest of the world . "
developing countries like india , china and brazil see rich nations in general as one problem .
developed countries are not pulling their end of the bargain by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases .
" we hope that -lrb- developed nations -rrb- will honor their commitments , " china 's head of delegation gao feng said .
" the extent to which they do will influence actions in the future . "
developing countries are also urging for more aid and non-polluting energy technologies such as solar and wind energy .

she had n't received any money in april and may and was starting to have difficulties paying her bills .
but the 82-year-old woman from a small town near hanover in northern germany was n't prepared for the explanation she got . " do n't get upset , but you died on jan .

thomas lieth , the head of the bundesknappschaft fund , said kruse had been confused with another client who had died , but defended the decision to ask for proof she was alive . " when someone just telephones us , it is not enough , " lieth said , adding that the fund had apologized . kruse said she would have expected a little more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

despite the turbulence over iraq , german officials say the term 's been constructive .

the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

" i do n't downplay in any way the personal catastrophes which happened , " he said during a press conference with his czech counterpart , jiri paroubek .
" but the causes were the occupation and the war , and these came from germany . " he insisted that the continuing row over the wartime expulsion could not negatively affect the " excellent " bilateral relations . stoiber attacks benes statue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edvard benes at the weekend rally in germany , sudeten germans and their patron , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , again called for the so-called benes decrees to be revoked and attacked the unveiling of a statue in prague this week to former czechoslovak president edvard benes -lrb- photo -rrb- , who signed the expulsion order . around 2.5 million people were expelled from czechoslovakia under the 1945 benes decrees on the basis that they had supported hitler 's annexation .
their property was confiscated .
between 25,000 and 30,000 people died during the expulsion . the postwar transfer of the strong german minority from czechoslovakia 's border areas , the sudeten territories , continues to stir up emotions in both the czech republic and germany , although not at a government level . after their talks in prague schröder and paroubek traveled to terezin , also known as theresienstadt , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- north of prague , to the site of the former nazi transit camp to pay tribute to the 35,000 people who died there . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair warns of german " victims ' culture " british prime minister tony blair described germany as a friend in an interview with a german tabloid monday , but warned germans not to foster a " victims ' culture " since the nazis started world war ii .

" i do n't downplay in any way the personal catastrophes which happened , " he said during a press conference with his czech counterpart , jiri paroubek .
" but the causes were the occupation and the war , and these came from germany . " he insisted that the continuing row over the wartime expulsion could not negatively affect the " excellent " bilateral relations . stoiber attacks benes statue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edvard benes at the weekend rally in germany , sudeten germans and their patron , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , again called for the so-called benes decrees to be revoked and attacked the unveiling of a statue in prague this week to former czechoslovak president edvard benes -lrb- photo -rrb- , who signed the expulsion order . around 2.5 million people were expelled from czechoslovakia under the 1945 benes decrees on the basis that they had supported hitler 's annexation .
their property was confiscated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

" critical comments regarding the competitive behavior of companies and investors have sparked fresh uncertainty , " the german central bank wrote in its may monthly report .
combined with the government 's decision to introduce a type of minimum wage in a number of key sectors as a weapon against wage-dumping from the eastward expansion of the eu , such comments " raise doubts about the willingness -lrb- of the government -rrb- to press ahead with its economic reforms , " the bundesbank wrote .
" it must be recognized that jobs which cost more than employees contribute to a company 's earnings can not survive in an open economy . "
with unemployment in the euro zone 's biggest economy at postwar highs and the government 's popularity slumping to new lows in opinion polls , leading politicians have attacked what they see as the avarice of capitalism , likening multinational companies that slash jobs in order to boost profits to swarms of locusts that devour everything in their path and then move on .
the bundesbank insisted that " further decisive reforms " are needed if domestic demand in germany is to emerge from its long stagnation . dw-world.de deutsche börse meets " locusts " some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .

what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia .

" this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.05.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc bundesbank deaf to calls for ecb rate cut the current level of interest rates in the 12-country euro zone is no impediment to growth in the region , the bundesbank wrote in its may monthly report published on monday , implicitly rejecting recent political calls for lower rates .
" as far as monetary policy is concerned , the conditions are in place for more growth and employment , " the german central bank wrote .
economics minister wolfgang clement recently complained that the current cost of borrowing in europe - the ecb has held its key rates steady at 2.0 percent since june 2003 - was not concurrent with german interests and that the bank had room for maneuver on rates .
the bundesbank disagreed .
" price developments are continuing to support purchasing power , " and the low level of interest rates were an incentive to spend , it argued .
and it lobbed the ball back into the government 's court , saying that " in order to overcome the weakness of domestic demand , further decisive -lrb- structural -rrb- reforms are imperative . " dw-world.de german economy set for modest growth the german economy is set to grow only modestly this year , germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , predicted on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.05.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc bundesbank criticizes capitalism debate the bundesbank on tuesday waded into the current debate in germany over the perceived excesses of capitalism , criticizing the government for sending conflicting signals about its willingness to implement much-needed structural reforms .
" critical comments regarding the competitive behavior of companies and investors have sparked fresh uncertainty , " the german central bank wrote in its may monthly report .
combined with the government 's decision to introduce a type of minimum wage in a number of key sectors as a weapon against wage-dumping from the eastward expansion of the eu , such comments " raise doubts about the willingness -lrb- of the government -rrb- to press ahead with its economic reforms , " the bundesbank wrote .
" it must be recognized that jobs which cost more than employees contribute to a company 's earnings can not survive in an open economy . "
with unemployment in the euro zone 's biggest economy at postwar highs and the government 's popularity slumping to new lows in opinion polls , leading politicians have attacked what they see as the avarice of capitalism , likening multinational companies that slash jobs in order to boost profits to swarms of locusts that devour everything in their path and then move on .

the number of extremists displaying neo-nazi sympathies rose more than 25 percent between 2003 and 2004 , from 3,000 to 3,800 , schily said at a press conference to present the findings of the domestic intelligence service in 2004 .
these extremists consider themselves to be " the fighters of a ' german reich ' which contains no foreigners or jews and is led by a führer , " the interior ministry report said .
the intelligence services also recorded a rise of more than 10 percent in the number of crimes committed by the extreme-right , such as attacks on immigrants and denial of the holocaust .
the figure was 12,051 offences in 2004 compared with 10,792 the year before .
the total number of far-right extremists prone to violence remained the same at around 10,000 , with around half living in the former east germany , where unemployment is higher .
the report added that neo-nazi supporters were playing an increasing role in the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , which caused shockwaves when it won more than nine percent of the votes in an election in the eastern state of saxony last september .
schily described the election result as " shameful . " dw-world.de a " day of democracy " against neo-nazis berlin , the final battlefield of wwii , is planning a " day of democracy " filled with activities designed to keep neo-nazis from making an appearance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany opinion : a good beginning , but that 's all germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 what can the world expect post-kyoto ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change could endanger the employment of icebreakers a two-day united nations ’ meeting on climate change is taking place in the german city of bonn .
one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed nations are supposed to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions the developed nations should take the lead in reducing pollution but developing nations must also consider how they could take part in the future without endangering economic growth .
kyoto just entered into force on february 16 after years of delays and was significantly weakened by the united states ' pullout .
nevertheless , kyoto supporters realize that future treaties can not be effective without the inclusion of the us .
" this is a global problem - we ca n't let the united states stay out , " said argentine environment minister gines gonzalez garcia .
australia , another outsider , must also be pulled into the fold , he said .
effects of continued climate change " disastrous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin is one of the most vocal supporters of environmental protection kyoto 's champion , the european union , says that the planet is warming at an alarmingly fast pace .
one of europe 's most outspoken politicians in favor of the treaty is germany 's environment minister jürgen trittin .
" climate change is already a harsh reality , " the green party politician told delegates in bonn .
" a global warming of two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- or more -lrb- by the year 2100 over pre-industrial levels -rrb- increases the likelihood of disastrous and irreversible damage . "
the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .

" critical comments regarding the competitive behavior of companies and investors have sparked fresh uncertainty , " the german central bank wrote in its may monthly report .
combined with the government 's decision to introduce a type of minimum wage in a number of key sectors as a weapon against wage-dumping from the eastward expansion of the eu , such comments " raise doubts about the willingness -lrb- of the government -rrb- to press ahead with its economic reforms , " the bundesbank wrote .
" it must be recognized that jobs which cost more than employees contribute to a company 's earnings can not survive in an open economy . "
with unemployment in the euro zone 's biggest economy at postwar highs and the government 's popularity slumping to new lows in opinion polls , leading politicians have attacked what they see as the avarice of capitalism , likening multinational companies that slash jobs in order to boost profits to swarms of locusts that devour everything in their path and then move on .
the bundesbank insisted that " further decisive reforms " are needed if domestic demand in germany is to emerge from its long stagnation . dw-world.de deutsche börse meets " locusts " some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .
but recent events at deutsche börse have lent the anti-capitalists support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed nations are supposed to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions the developed nations should take the lead in reducing pollution but developing nations must also consider how they could take part in the future without endangering economic growth .
kyoto just entered into force on february 16 after years of delays and was significantly weakened by the united states ' pullout .
nevertheless , kyoto supporters realize that future treaties can not be effective without the inclusion of the us .
" this is a global problem - we ca n't let the united states stay out , " said argentine environment minister gines gonzalez garcia .

" a global warming of two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- or more -lrb- by the year 2100 over pre-industrial levels -rrb- increases the likelihood of disastrous and irreversible damage . "
the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .
also , a rush of freshwater into the north atlantic could shut down the gulf stream which is responsible for the temperate european climate .
finger-pointing on many sides environmental groups view the united states as the single largest obstacle to curbing the current climate changes , most prominently global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is seen by environmental groups as one of the bigger hurdles in stopping global warming " the biggest challenge is the united states because they still do not want to come back to the international climate process , " markus steigenberger from friends of the earth told dw-radio .
" we desperately hope that the bush administration will wake up one day and understand that climate change is also threatening the us and the rest of the world . "
developing countries like india , china and brazil see rich nations in general as one problem .
developed countries are not pulling their end of the bargain by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases .
" we hope that -lrb- developed nations -rrb- will honor their commitments , " china 's head of delegation gao feng said .
" the extent to which they do will influence actions in the future . "
developing countries are also urging for more aid and non-polluting energy technologies such as solar and wind energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed nations are supposed to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions the developed nations should take the lead in reducing pollution but developing nations must also consider how they could take part in the future without endangering economic growth .
kyoto just entered into force on february 16 after years of delays and was significantly weakened by the united states ' pullout .
nevertheless , kyoto supporters realize that future treaties can not be effective without the inclusion of the us .
" this is a global problem - we ca n't let the united states stay out , " said argentine environment minister gines gonzalez garcia .
australia , another outsider , must also be pulled into the fold , he said .
effects of continued climate change " disastrous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin is one of the most vocal supporters of environmental protection kyoto 's champion , the european union , says that the planet is warming at an alarmingly fast pace .
one of europe 's most outspoken politicians in favor of the treaty is germany 's environment minister jürgen trittin .
" climate change is already a harsh reality , " the green party politician told delegates in bonn .
" a global warming of two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- or more -lrb- by the year 2100 over pre-industrial levels -rrb- increases the likelihood of disastrous and irreversible damage . "
the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .
also , a rush of freshwater into the north atlantic could shut down the gulf stream which is responsible for the temperate european climate .
finger-pointing on many sides environmental groups view the united states as the single largest obstacle to curbing the current climate changes , most prominently global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is seen by environmental groups as one of the bigger hurdles in stopping global warming " the biggest challenge is the united states because they still do not want to come back to the international climate process , " markus steigenberger from friends of the earth told dw-radio .
" we desperately hope that the bush administration will wake up one day and understand that climate change is also threatening the us and the rest of the world . "
developing countries like india , china and brazil see rich nations in general as one problem .
developed countries are not pulling their end of the bargain by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases .
" we hope that -lrb- developed nations -rrb- will honor their commitments , " china 's head of delegation gao feng said .
" the extent to which they do will influence actions in the future . "
developing countries are also urging for more aid and non-polluting energy technologies such as solar and wind energy .
but no matter who or what is primarily responsible for climate change , cooperation and common solutions are needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

" never before has europe been so strong , so safe , so close to being united , " president aleksander kwasniewski of host nation poland said in a speech to open the summit , held in warsaw 's royal castle , which , like many landmarks in the polish capital , was rebuilt after being reduced to rubble in world war ii . " what better place than warsaw to organize the first ever summit of the whole of europe , " said the speaker of the council 's parliamentary council , rene van der linden .
" warsaw , a city which became the symbol of the horrors of world war ii ... a city that today welcomes a united europe for the first time in history , a europe united by the power of values , not the power of arms , " he said . portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country will take over the six-month chairmanship of the council from poland when the summit ends on tuesday , also praised europe 's oldest political organization , for its role in promoting human rights , in consolidating democracy and expanding the rule of law , which he called " the three main pillars of its activities . " " the political transformations that have been taking place in europe in the last decades demand more than ever a sustainable commitment to those values which reinforce our unity , " said socrates at the first plenary session - entitled " european values , european unity . "
a missing piece but amid all the praise , lithuanian leader valdas adamkus lithuanian president valdas adamkus reminded the gathering that a piece was missing in the puzzle of a united europe .
" the fact that european values have not won their way in belarus testifies to our joint failure , " adamkus said . " one european country is missing at this forum , a country whose citizens subscribe to the values of the council of europe , but who have been robbed of the opportunity to live by them . the alexander lukashenko regime is further isolating itself and the people of belarus from the family of free european nations and the values of democracy , " adamkus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' lukashenko lukashenko -lrb- photo -rrb- has been criticized in the west for the alleged systematic persecution of his political opponents , for rights abuses and for hampering freedom of the press .
belarus wants to join the 46-member council , which was founded in 1949 , four years after the end of world war ii . no room for lukashenko 's belarus a key role of the council since 1989 , when the berlin wall crumbled , has been to monitor human rights and rule of law in europe 's post-communist democracies .
last year , the council poured cold water on belarus 's membership ambitions , with its rapporteur on the persecution of the press in the country saying it " stands no foreseeable chance of being admitted .

" i do n't downplay in any way the personal catastrophes which happened , " he said during a press conference with his czech counterpart , jiri paroubek .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed nations are supposed to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions the developed nations should take the lead in reducing pollution but developing nations must also consider how they could take part in the future without endangering economic growth .
kyoto just entered into force on february 16 after years of delays and was significantly weakened by the united states ' pullout .
nevertheless , kyoto supporters realize that future treaties can not be effective without the inclusion of the us .
" this is a global problem - we ca n't let the united states stay out , " said argentine environment minister gines gonzalez garcia .
australia , another outsider , must also be pulled into the fold , he said .
effects of continued climate change " disastrous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin is one of the most vocal supporters of environmental protection kyoto 's champion , the european union , says that the planet is warming at an alarmingly fast pace .
one of europe 's most outspoken politicians in favor of the treaty is germany 's environment minister jürgen trittin .
" climate change is already a harsh reality , " the green party politician told delegates in bonn .
" a global warming of two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- or more -lrb- by the year 2100 over pre-industrial levels -rrb- increases the likelihood of disastrous and irreversible damage . "
the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .
also , a rush of freshwater into the north atlantic could shut down the gulf stream which is responsible for the temperate european climate .
finger-pointing on many sides environmental groups view the united states as the single largest obstacle to curbing the current climate changes , most prominently global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is seen by environmental groups as one of the bigger hurdles in stopping global warming " the biggest challenge is the united states because they still do not want to come back to the international climate process , " markus steigenberger from friends of the earth told dw-radio .
" we desperately hope that the bush administration will wake up one day and understand that climate change is also threatening the us and the rest of the world . "
developing countries like india , china and brazil see rich nations in general as one problem .
developed countries are not pulling their end of the bargain by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases .
" we hope that -lrb- developed nations -rrb- will honor their commitments , " china 's head of delegation gao feng said .
" the extent to which they do will influence actions in the future . "
developing countries are also urging for more aid and non-polluting energy technologies such as solar and wind energy .
but no matter who or what is primarily responsible for climate change , cooperation and common solutions are needed .
" the best way to ensure post-2012 is to ensure now the success of the kyoto protocol , " brazil 's delegate andrea correa do lago said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

" i do n't downplay in any way the personal catastrophes which happened , " he said during a press conference with his czech counterpart , jiri paroubek .
" but the causes were the occupation and the war , and these came from germany . " he insisted that the continuing row over the wartime expulsion could not negatively affect the " excellent " bilateral relations . stoiber attacks benes statue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edvard benes at the weekend rally in germany , sudeten germans and their patron , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , again called for the so-called benes decrees to be revoked and attacked the unveiling of a statue in prague this week to former czechoslovak president edvard benes -lrb- photo -rrb- , who signed the expulsion order . around 2.5 million people were expelled from czechoslovakia under the 1945 benes decrees on the basis that they had supported hitler 's annexation .
their property was confiscated .
between 25,000 and 30,000 people died during the expulsion . the postwar transfer of the strong german minority from czechoslovakia 's border areas , the sudeten territories , continues to stir up emotions in both the czech republic and germany , although not at a government level . after their talks in prague schröder and paroubek traveled to terezin , also known as theresienstadt , 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- north of prague , to the site of the former nazi transit camp to pay tribute to the 35,000 people who died there . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair warns of german " victims ' culture " british prime minister tony blair described germany as a friend in an interview with a german tabloid monday , but warned germans not to foster a " victims ' culture " since the nazis started world war ii .

the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .

the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

" never before has europe been so strong , so safe , so close to being united , " president aleksander kwasniewski of host nation poland said in a speech to open the summit , held in warsaw 's royal castle , which , like many landmarks in the polish capital , was rebuilt after being reduced to rubble in world war ii . " what better place than warsaw to organize the first ever summit of the whole of europe , " said the speaker of the council 's parliamentary council , rene van der linden .
" warsaw , a city which became the symbol of the horrors of world war ii ... a city that today welcomes a united europe for the first time in history , a europe united by the power of values , not the power of arms , " he said . portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country will take over the six-month chairmanship of the council from poland when the summit ends on tuesday , also praised europe 's oldest political organization , for its role in promoting human rights , in consolidating democracy and expanding the rule of law , which he called " the three main pillars of its activities . " " the political transformations that have been taking place in europe in the last decades demand more than ever a sustainable commitment to those values which reinforce our unity , " said socrates at the first plenary session - entitled " european values , european unity . "
a missing piece but amid all the praise , lithuanian leader valdas adamkus lithuanian president valdas adamkus reminded the gathering that a piece was missing in the puzzle of a united europe .
" the fact that european values have not won their way in belarus testifies to our joint failure , " adamkus said . " one european country is missing at this forum , a country whose citizens subscribe to the values of the council of europe , but who have been robbed of the opportunity to live by them . the alexander lukashenko regime is further isolating itself and the people of belarus from the family of free european nations and the values of democracy , " adamkus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' lukashenko lukashenko -lrb- photo -rrb- has been criticized in the west for the alleged systematic persecution of his political opponents , for rights abuses and for hampering freedom of the press .
belarus wants to join the 46-member council , which was founded in 1949 , four years after the end of world war ii . no room for lukashenko 's belarus a key role of the council since 1989 , when the berlin wall crumbled , has been to monitor human rights and rule of law in europe 's post-communist democracies .
last year , the council poured cold water on belarus 's membership ambitions , with its rapporteur on the persecution of the press in the country saying it " stands no foreseeable chance of being admitted . " french foreign minister michel barnier urged belarus " to make a vital effort " to gain membership to the council , which holds as its basic values democracy , rule of law and respect of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis council secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- alluded to the absence of belarus at the summit , saying " 46 out of 47 european countries " were members of the grouping .
davis , a former british lawmaker from the multi-ethnic birmingham constituency also urged summiteers to " campaign against the new evil of terrorism and the old evil of racism .

" i do n't downplay in any way the personal catastrophes which happened , " he said during a press conference with his czech counterpart , jiri paroubek .
" but the causes were the occupation and the war , and these came from germany .

their property was confiscated .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .

she had n't received any money in april and may and was starting to have difficulties paying her bills .
but the 82-year-old woman from a small town near hanover in northern germany was n't prepared for the explanation she got . " do n't get upset , but you died on jan .

instead , the fund official asked for a so-called " life certificate , " obtainable from her municipal office at 4.80 euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . the certificate stated that kruse was alive and well and fully able to present her identity papers . how about some flowers ?
thomas lieth , the head of the bundesknappschaft fund , said kruse had been confused with another client who had died , but defended the decision to ask for proof she was alive . " when someone just telephones us , it is not enough , " lieth said , adding that the fund had apologized . kruse said she would have expected a little more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

despite the turbulence over iraq , german officials say the term 's been constructive .

" one european country is missing at this forum , a country whose citizens subscribe to the values of the council of europe , but who have been robbed of the opportunity to live by them . the alexander lukashenko regime is further isolating itself and the people of belarus from the family of free european nations and the values of democracy , " adamkus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' lukashenko lukashenko -lrb- photo -rrb- has been criticized in the west for the alleged systematic persecution of his political opponents , for rights abuses and for hampering freedom of the press .
belarus wants to join the 46-member council , which was founded in 1949 , four years after the end of world war ii . no room for lukashenko 's belarus a key role of the council since 1989 , when the berlin wall crumbled , has been to monitor human rights and rule of law in europe 's post-communist democracies .
last year , the council poured cold water on belarus 's membership ambitions , with its rapporteur on the persecution of the press in the country saying it " stands no foreseeable chance of being admitted . " french foreign minister michel barnier urged belarus " to make a vital effort " to gain membership to the council , which holds as its basic values democracy , rule of law and respect of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis council secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- alluded to the absence of belarus at the summit , saying " 46 out of 47 european countries " were members of the grouping .
davis , a former british lawmaker from the multi-ethnic birmingham constituency also urged summiteers to " campaign against the new evil of terrorism and the old evil of racism . " later monday , the summit participants , who included 22 european presidents and 13 prime ministers , were meant to sign conventions on the prevention of terrorism , human trafficking , and money laundering and the financing of terrorist acts .
then they must be ratified by individual countries ' parliaments and translated onto the statute books . the council 's parliamentary speaker , van der linden , urged summit participants to actively implement the conventions they would sign in warsaw , to ensure the future of the council and of europe .
" the decisions you are about to take will enable us to meet the challenges " of responding to european citizens ' needs , of working more closely with civil society , of erasing the dividing lines still evident in europe , he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw hosts pan-european summit sixty years after the end of world war ii , heads of state from 46 countries are meeting in warsaw for a pan-european summit to define future priorities in a new political mandate for the council of europe .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed nations are supposed to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions the developed nations should take the lead in reducing pollution but developing nations must also consider how they could take part in the future without endangering economic growth .
kyoto just entered into force on february 16 after years of delays and was significantly weakened by the united states ' pullout .
nevertheless , kyoto supporters realize that future treaties can not be effective without the inclusion of the us .

the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .
also , a rush of freshwater into the north atlantic could shut down the gulf stream which is responsible for the temperate european climate .
finger-pointing on many sides environmental groups view the united states as the single largest obstacle to curbing the current climate changes , most prominently global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs .

" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed nations are supposed to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions the developed nations should take the lead in reducing pollution but developing nations must also consider how they could take part in the future without endangering economic growth .
kyoto just entered into force on february 16 after years of delays and was significantly weakened by the united states ' pullout .
nevertheless , kyoto supporters realize that future treaties can not be effective without the inclusion of the us .
" this is a global problem - we ca n't let the united states stay out , " said argentine environment minister gines gonzalez garcia .
australia , another outsider , must also be pulled into the fold , he said .
effects of continued climate change " disastrous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin is one of the most vocal supporters of environmental protection kyoto 's champion , the european union , says that the planet is warming at an alarmingly fast pace .
one of europe 's most outspoken politicians in favor of the treaty is germany 's environment minister jürgen trittin .
" climate change is already a harsh reality , " the green party politician told delegates in bonn .
" a global warming of two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- or more -lrb- by the year 2100 over pre-industrial levels -rrb- increases the likelihood of disastrous and irreversible damage . "
the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .
also , a rush of freshwater into the north atlantic could shut down the gulf stream which is responsible for the temperate european climate .
finger-pointing on many sides environmental groups view the united states as the single largest obstacle to curbing the current climate changes , most prominently global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is seen by environmental groups as one of the bigger hurdles in stopping global warming " the biggest challenge is the united states because they still do not want to come back to the international climate process , " markus steigenberger from friends of the earth told dw-radio .
" we desperately hope that the bush administration will wake up one day and understand that climate change is also threatening the us and the rest of the world . "
developing countries like india , china and brazil see rich nations in general as one problem .
developed countries are not pulling their end of the bargain by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases .
" we hope that -lrb- developed nations -rrb- will honor their commitments , " china 's head of delegation gao feng said .
" the extent to which they do will influence actions in the future . "
developing countries are also urging for more aid and non-polluting energy technologies such as solar and wind energy .
but no matter who or what is primarily responsible for climate change , cooperation and common solutions are needed .
" the best way to ensure post-2012 is to ensure now the success of the kyoto protocol , " brazil 's delegate andrea correa do lago said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on climate change rich countries cut emissions , more needed opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons drastic climate change affects germany opinion : a good beginning , but that 's all germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 what can the world expect post-kyoto ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change could endanger the employment of icebreakers a two-day united nations ’ meeting on climate change is taking place in the german city of bonn .
one goal of the informal conference is to start considering what to do after the kyoto protocol runs out in 2012 . over 150 countries are meeting in bonn , germany to discuss the post-kyoto protocol era .
one of the major calls is for the world 's largest polluter , the united states , and developing nations to participate when the protocol expires in 2012 .
the kyoto protocol is meant to obligate rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from power plants , cars and factories by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developed nations are supposed to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions the developed nations should take the lead in reducing pollution but developing nations must also consider how they could take part in the future without endangering economic growth .
kyoto just entered into force on february 16 after years of delays and was significantly weakened by the united states ' pullout .
nevertheless , kyoto supporters realize that future treaties can not be effective without the inclusion of the us .
" this is a global problem - we ca n't let the united states stay out , " said argentine environment minister gines gonzalez garcia .
australia , another outsider , must also be pulled into the fold , he said .
effects of continued climate change " disastrous " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister jürgen trittin is one of the most vocal supporters of environmental protection kyoto 's champion , the european union , says that the planet is warming at an alarmingly fast pace .
one of europe 's most outspoken politicians in favor of the treaty is germany 's environment minister jürgen trittin .
" climate change is already a harsh reality , " the green party politician told delegates in bonn .
" a global warming of two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- or more -lrb- by the year 2100 over pre-industrial levels -rrb- increases the likelihood of disastrous and irreversible damage . "
the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .
also , a rush of freshwater into the north atlantic could shut down the gulf stream which is responsible for the temperate european climate .
finger-pointing on many sides environmental groups view the united states as the single largest obstacle to curbing the current climate changes , most prominently global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush is seen by environmental groups as one of the bigger hurdles in stopping global warming " the biggest challenge is the united states because they still do not want to come back to the international climate process , " markus steigenberger from friends of the earth told dw-radio .
" we desperately hope that the bush administration will wake up one day and understand that climate change is also threatening the us and the rest of the world . "
developing countries like india , china and brazil see rich nations in general as one problem .
developed countries are not pulling their end of the bargain by reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases .
" we hope that -lrb- developed nations -rrb- will honor their commitments , " china 's head of delegation gao feng said .
" the extent to which they do will influence actions in the future . "
developing countries are also urging for more aid and non-polluting energy technologies such as solar and wind energy .
but no matter who or what is primarily responsible for climate change , cooperation and common solutions are needed .
" the best way to ensure post-2012 is to ensure now the success of the kyoto protocol , " brazil 's delegate andrea correa do lago said . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

" never before has europe been so strong , so safe , so close to being united , " president aleksander kwasniewski of host nation poland said in a speech to open the summit , held in warsaw 's royal castle , which , like many landmarks in the polish capital , was rebuilt after being reduced to rubble in world war ii . " what better place than warsaw to organize the first ever summit of the whole of europe , " said the speaker of the council 's parliamentary council , rene van der linden .
" warsaw , a city which became the symbol of the horrors of world war ii ... a city that today welcomes a united europe for the first time in history , a europe united by the power of values , not the power of arms , " he said . portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country will take over the six-month chairmanship of the council from poland when the summit ends on tuesday , also praised europe 's oldest political organization , for its role in promoting human rights , in consolidating democracy and expanding the rule of law , which he called " the three main pillars of its activities . " " the political transformations that have been taking place in europe in the last decades demand more than ever a sustainable commitment to those values which reinforce our unity , " said socrates at the first plenary session - entitled " european values , european unity . "
a missing piece but amid all the praise , lithuanian leader valdas adamkus lithuanian president valdas adamkus reminded the gathering that a piece was missing in the puzzle of a united europe .
" the fact that european values have not won their way in belarus testifies to our joint failure , " adamkus said . " one european country is missing at this forum , a country whose citizens subscribe to the values of the council of europe , but who have been robbed of the opportunity to live by them . the alexander lukashenko regime is further isolating itself and the people of belarus from the family of free european nations and the values of democracy , " adamkus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' lukashenko lukashenko -lrb- photo -rrb- has been criticized in the west for the alleged systematic persecution of his political opponents , for rights abuses and for hampering freedom of the press .
belarus wants to join the 46-member council , which was founded in 1949 , four years after the end of world war ii . no room for lukashenko 's belarus a key role of the council since 1989 , when the berlin wall crumbled , has been to monitor human rights and rule of law in europe 's post-communist democracies .
last year , the council poured cold water on belarus 's membership ambitions , with its rapporteur on the persecution of the press in the country saying it " stands no foreseeable chance of being admitted . " french foreign minister michel barnier urged belarus " to make a vital effort " to gain membership to the council , which holds as its basic values democracy , rule of law and respect of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis council secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- alluded to the absence of belarus at the summit , saying " 46 out of 47 european countries " were members of the grouping .
davis , a former british lawmaker from the multi-ethnic birmingham constituency also urged summiteers to " campaign against the new evil of terrorism and the old evil of racism . " later monday , the summit participants , who included 22 european presidents and 13 prime ministers , were meant to sign conventions on the prevention of terrorism , human trafficking , and money laundering and the financing of terrorist acts .
then they must be ratified by individual countries ' parliaments and translated onto the statute books . the council 's parliamentary speaker , van der linden , urged summit participants to actively implement the conventions they would sign in warsaw , to ensure the future of the council and of europe .
" the decisions you are about to take will enable us to meet the challenges " of responding to european citizens ' needs , of working more closely with civil society , of erasing the dividing lines still evident in europe , he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw hosts pan-european summit sixty years after the end of world war ii , heads of state from 46 countries are meeting in warsaw for a pan-european summit to define future priorities in a new political mandate for the council of europe .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome . " economic interests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder talk during their meeting in moscow on may 9 , 2005 khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder implicated in kremlin intrigue after former yukos head mikhail khodorkovsky made his final statement in court monday , his lawyers accused gerhard schröder of complicity in the kremlin 's bid to eliminate dangerously independent tycoons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

" worried about what had happened to her pension checks , martha kruse called up her pension fund .
she had n't received any money in april and may and was starting to have difficulties paying her bills .
but the 82-year-old woman from a small town near hanover in northern germany was n't prepared for the explanation she got . " do n't get upset , but you died on jan .

i 'm still very much alive . bureaucracy 's beauty she had n't taken into consideration the mysterious ways of germany 's bureaucracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martha kruse 's still very much alive just hearing kruse 's voice on the phone was n't good enough .
instead , the fund official asked for a so-called " life certificate , " obtainable from her municipal office at 4.80 euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . the certificate stated that kruse was alive and well and fully able to present her identity papers . how about some flowers ?
thomas lieth , the head of the bundesknappschaft fund , said kruse had been confused with another client who had died , but defended the decision to ask for proof she was alive . " when someone just telephones us , it is not enough , " lieth said , adding that the fund had apologized . kruse said she would have expected a little more .

the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome .

the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .
ongoing dispute for over ten years , there have been discussions to reform the un security council .
the g4 launched the latest campaign last september .
secretary general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- has also proposed his own ideas in reforming the security council , one with 24 members , ten of which would be permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i urge to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , and i suggest that the renewed security council should make clear the principles by which it intends to be guided and decide whether or not to authorize the use of force , " said annan when he presented his proposals .
while the veto right appears to be the biggest hurdle for the us to accept an expansion , china is principally opposed to japan 's candidacy .
nevertheless , after the us , germany and japan are the largest donors to the un , something that may carry some weight when it comes to a vote this summer . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as non-permanent member of the un security council ends dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2005 eu : khodorkovsky case " internal affair " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax evader or political prisoner ?
the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome . " economic interests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder talk during their meeting in moscow on may 9 , 2005 khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder implicated in kremlin intrigue after former yukos head mikhail khodorkovsky made his final statement in court monday , his lawyers accused gerhard schröder of complicity in the kremlin 's bid to eliminate dangerously independent tycoons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.05.2005 germany starts un reform resolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is determined to get a permanent seat at the security table germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .

the us and china are showing signs of resistance . germany , brazil , india and japan have sent a new un motion into circulation in which they propose an enlargement of the un security council from the current 15 members to 25 .
the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- are asking that six of those ten new seats be permanent , of which they would be included , said a diplomat of the four nations .
the g4 is planning to introduce the resolution at the un general assembly in june but are starting off cautiously in gaining momentum for the vote .
the draft resolution was being shown to countries that might co-sponsor it at the general assembly and to a second group that supports reform of the united nations , according to the diplomat .
the necessary 128 countries in favor of the motion is anything but certain and finding a consensus on the issue of the rights of the permanent members will not be easy to reach .
the right of veto is a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 wants the door to be opened to permanent status on the council the motion does not mention who would be amongst the 11 permanent members but the current permanent security council members , the us , russia , china , france and britain would certainly retain their seats .
the text also does not say who amongst the six new permanent members would get a seat , but recommends two for asia , two for africa , one for latin america and one for western europe , which germany would naturally have its eye on .
a two-thirds majority of the 191 members is needed for passage in which one hotly-contested point will be which rights permanent members should receive .
" all permanent members should have the same responsibilities and the same rights , " says the text .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us senate , among other legislative bodies , may show great resistance to an expansion of the security council that would also mean the right of veto , a matter that most un observers do n't see washington , moscow or beijing passing onto others very soon .
" even if a two-thirds majority would be reached , the current five members would have to be among these -lrb- permanent members -rrb- .
the final model would have to be ratified by the parliaments of the five permanent members , including the us senate and the duma in moscow , and that is a very high hurdle , " andreas zumach , a un commentator from germany , told dw-radio .
the g4 has publicly said that it does not want to the veto issue to become a cause to block the reform .
this may be necessary because the new york times said sunday that washington would not support the g4 's demand unless they agreed to give up the veto right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2005 eu : khodorkovsky case " internal affair " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax evader or political prisoner ?
the european commission declined to comment tuesday on judgments handed down on russian oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , but german observers criticized a lack of objectivity in the trial . the european union 's executive arm , speaking as khodorkovsky was found guilty on one count of fraud , said that it has always pressed russia on human rights , and would continue to do so . " the commission is not in a position to judge , and it 's not up to the commission to judge whether mr. khodorkovsky is guilty or not , " said a spokeswoman for eu external relations commissioner benita ferrera-waldner .
" but what is important from our point view is the signal sent to the business and investor community .
what 's important to us is that there is a transparent and non-discriminatory framework for business to invest in russia . " she was speaking after khodorkovsky and his business associate platon lebedev were found guilty by a moscow court tuesday of a count of fraud , the first of 11 counts in the controversial trial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian riot police detain a khodorkovsky supporter khodorkovsky outside the court room reading of the verdict began monday , with a three-judge panel taking turns to read from the complex indictment in the 11-month trial . chief eu commission spokeswoman francoise le bail also underlined that the eu executive can not meddle in internal russian affairs . " the yukos affair is of course a domestic and internal affair for russia , " she said .
" we have always been advocating with the russian authorities ... for respect of human rights and respect of civil society as well , and this is what we will continue doing . " a blank check from schröder ? german chancellor gerhard schröder also has n't seemed perturbed by the case .
schröder , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it is n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . but german observers of the trial came to a different conclusion and criticized schröder 's stand in the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger former german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , who is monitoring the trial for the council of europe , said schröder 's statements amounted to a " blank check " that he has issued " without knowing what 's really going on . " in an interview with german public broadcaster mdr on monday , leutheusser-schnarrenberger also called the judge 's verdict " a ratification of the indictment . " this shows that the judge is n't making an objective decision , " the neoliberal free democratic german parliamentarian added .
" the prosecutor dominates , as has been the case throughout the trial . " an authoritarian relapse ? others in germany also expressed concern over the state of russian rule of law . " judging by the verdict so far , everything seems to suggest that the case against khodorkovsky has been politically motivated , " said katrin göring-eckardt , the parliamentary leader of germany 's greens , who form part of the governing coalition . she added that khodorkovsky was on trial for his own political ambitions and warned against " a relapse into authoritarian times that seemed to have been overcome . " economic interests ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder talk during their meeting in moscow on may 9 , 2005 khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder implicated in kremlin intrigue after former yukos head mikhail khodorkovsky made his final statement in court monday , his lawyers accused gerhard schröder of complicity in the kremlin 's bid to eliminate dangerously independent tycoons .
-lrb- april 13 , 2004 -rrb- verdict in yukos trial postponed the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow .

the possible effects according to some scientists are northern polar ice melts .

" never before has europe been so strong , so safe , so close to being united , " president aleksander kwasniewski of host nation poland said in a speech to open the summit , held in warsaw 's royal castle , which , like many landmarks in the polish capital , was rebuilt after being reduced to rubble in world war ii . " what better place than warsaw to organize the first ever summit of the whole of europe , " said the speaker of the council 's parliamentary council , rene van der linden .
" warsaw , a city which became the symbol of the horrors of world war ii ... a city that today welcomes a united europe for the first time in history , a europe united by the power of values , not the power of arms , " he said . portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country will take over the six-month chairmanship of the council from poland when the summit ends on tuesday , also praised europe 's oldest political organization , for its role in promoting human rights , in consolidating democracy and expanding the rule of law , which he called " the three main pillars of its activities . " " the political transformations that have been taking place in europe in the last decades demand more than ever a sustainable commitment to those values which reinforce our unity , " said socrates at the first plenary session - entitled " european values , european unity . "
a missing piece but amid all the praise , lithuanian leader valdas adamkus lithuanian president valdas adamkus reminded the gathering that a piece was missing in the puzzle of a united europe .
" the fact that european values have not won their way in belarus testifies to our joint failure , " adamkus said . " one european country is missing at this forum , a country whose citizens subscribe to the values of the council of europe , but who have been robbed of the opportunity to live by them . the alexander lukashenko regime is further isolating itself and the people of belarus from the family of free european nations and the values of democracy , " adamkus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' lukashenko lukashenko -lrb- photo -rrb- has been criticized in the west for the alleged systematic persecution of his political opponents , for rights abuses and for hampering freedom of the press .
belarus wants to join the 46-member council , which was founded in 1949 , four years after the end of world war ii . no room for lukashenko 's belarus a key role of the council since 1989 , when the berlin wall crumbled , has been to monitor human rights and rule of law in europe 's post-communist democracies .
last year , the council poured cold water on belarus 's membership ambitions , with its rapporteur on the persecution of the press in the country saying it " stands no foreseeable chance of being admitted . " french foreign minister michel barnier urged belarus " to make a vital effort " to gain membership to the council , which holds as its basic values democracy , rule of law and respect of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terry davis council secretary general terry davis -lrb- photo -rrb- alluded to the absence of belarus at the summit , saying " 46 out of 47 european countries " were members of the grouping .
davis , a former british lawmaker from the multi-ethnic birmingham constituency also urged summiteers to " campaign against the new evil of terrorism and the old evil of racism . " later monday , the summit participants , who included 22 european presidents and 13 prime ministers , were meant to sign conventions on the prevention of terrorism , human trafficking , and money laundering and the financing of terrorist acts .
then they must be ratified by individual countries ' parliaments and translated onto the statute books . the council 's parliamentary speaker , van der linden , urged summit participants to actively implement the conventions they would sign in warsaw , to ensure the future of the council and of europe .
" the decisions you are about to take will enable us to meet the challenges " of responding to european citizens ' needs , of working more closely with civil society , of erasing the dividing lines still evident in europe , he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de warsaw hosts pan-european summit sixty years after the end of world war ii , heads of state from 46 countries are meeting in warsaw for a pan-european summit to define future priorities in a new political mandate for the council of europe .

on 17 may 1965 , a methane explosion hit the pentre seam at the cambrian colliery in tonypandy , rhondda .
dr chris williams , history professor at the university of wales , swansea , described it as " a tremendous tragedy " .
the explosion was followed the next year by the aberfan disaster , which claimed the lives of 144 people - 116 of them children - in october 1966 .
former miner ron eveleigh , who was working at another pit at the time , knew some of the men killed .
he also attended a mass funeral held for some of the victims at trealaw , which the then south wales secretary of the national union of miners also attended . "
i did not think twice about going into work the next day " ron eveleigh mr eveleigh described exactly what happened at the cambrian colliery shortly before 1300 bst on 17 may .
" it was a methane explosion in the coal face , " he said .
" there were two factors which contributed - first , there was a short circuit in the ventilation of the air going to the face , so the air was still .
" as the methane was built up , it was not ventilated away .
" second , there was an electrical breakdown and , in checking the electrical equipment , this caused a spark which ignited the methane gas . "
the explosion happened around 300 yards underground and more than one-and-a-half miles from the pithead .
mr eveleigh , who was at lewis merthyr colliery , is now a guide at the rhondda heritage park on the same site .
he said the cambrian disaster had shocked other miners , partly because it was considered to be a modern coalmine .
" even though it was an old mine , it had been modernised , " he added .
mr eveleigh said that , after investigations at the coal face , work restarted at cambrian colliery just days after the tragedy , and it did not stop him working .
" business would have gone on - they would have shut down but it was n't a long gap , a matter of days , " he said .
" i did not think twice about going into work the next day . "
in july 1965 , an inquiry into the disaster was held at the law courts in cardiff .
the cambrian colliery was shut in 1966 .
mr eveleigh finished working as a miner 22 years after the explosion , in 1987 .
mining historian and aberavon mp hywel francis said : " i remember seeing the list of men who died and what shocked and struck me was they were virtually all within a mile of the pit head , from the communities of clydach vale , blaenclydach , penrhiwfer , llwynypia and trealaw .
" there 's going to be an immediate memory for those people but it will be remembered as well historically because it continued that process of people turning away from the mining industry and leaving for cleaner and safer jobs . "

it has taken corris railway society 10 years to pay for the tattoo class loco , which was built section by section as money became available .
on the powys-gwynedd border near machynlleth , the track dates back to the 1800s .
it was closed in 1948 , but reopened in 2002 .
the new train is expected to go into service in the summer .
corris railway supplied a passenger service from 1883 , but in 1930 it was closed to the public and used as a route for slate .
in 2002 , corris railway society reopened the track to passengers .
society treasurer richard greenhough said : " the loco has been constructed in daventry over a 10-year period , funded by subscription from members of the corris railway society .
" it is the railway 's first new steam loco since 1921 , and may also be the first all-new steam loco constructed for the 2ft 3in track gauge since that date . "
" steam trains are far more attractive to people " richard greenhough mr greenhough added : " over the next few days it will be tested and then drivers will be given training . "
" we decided we wanted to build a locomotive because there was nothing second hand available and steam trains are far more attractive to people . "
corris railway also has three diesel engines which it has used to carry passengers along its three-quarters-of-a-mile section .
planning officials at gwynedd council and snowdonia national park are considering an application to extend the route to two-and-a-half miles .
built in daventry in northamptonshire , the new locomotive will arrive by truck from tamworth in staffordshire , where it is being painted .
it will be met in machynlleth by the town mayor before continuing its journey to the railway 's sheds at maespoeth , corris .

on 17 may 1965 , a methane explosion hit the pentre seam at the cambrian colliery in tonypandy , rhondda .
dr chris williams , history professor at the university of wales , swansea , described it as " a tremendous tragedy " .
the explosion was followed the next year by the aberfan disaster , which claimed the lives of 144 people - 116 of them children - in october 1966 .
former miner ron eveleigh , who was working at another pit at the time , knew some of the men killed .
he also attended a mass funeral held for some of the victims at trealaw , which the then south wales secretary of the national union of miners also attended .
i did not think twice about going into work the next day ron eveleigh mr eveleigh described exactly what happened at the cambrian colliery shortly before 1300 bst on 17 may .
" it was a methane explosion in the coal face , " he said .
" there were two factors which contributed - first , there was a short circuit in the ventilation of the air going to the face , so the air was still .
" as the methane was built up , it was not ventilated away .
" second , there was an electrical breakdown and , in checking the electrical equipment , this caused a spark which ignited the methane gas . "
the explosion happened around 300 yards underground and more than one-and-a-half miles from the pithead .
the aberfan disaster followed the year after the cambrian colliery blast mr eveleigh , who was at lewis merthyr colliery , is now a guide at the rhondda heritage park on the same site .
he said the cambrian disaster had shocked other miners , partly because it was considered to be a modern coalmine .
" even though it was an old mine , it had been modernised , " he added .
mr eveleigh said that , after investigations at the coal face , work restarted at cambrian colliery just days after the tragedy , and it did not stop him working .
" business would have gone on - they would have shut down but it was n't a long gap , a matter of days , " he said .
" i did not think twice about going into work the next day . "
in july 1965 , an inquiry into the disaster was held at the law courts in cardiff .
the cambrian colliery was shut in 1966 .
mr eveleigh finished working as a miner 22 years after the explosion , in 1987 .
mining historian and aberavon mp hywel francis said : " i remember seeing the list of men who died and what shocked and struck me was they were virtually all within a mile of the pit head , from the communities of clydach vale , blaenclydach , penrhiwfer , llwynypia and trealaw .
" there 's going to be an immediate memory for those people but it will be remembered as well historically because it continued that process of people turning away from the mining industry and leaving for cleaner and safer jobs . "

certainly , the case qualified as one of the biggest attempted frauds of all time .
but what really caught everyone 's attention that it was the bank 's computers and networks which had been compromised .
hackers , the headlines screamed , were burrowing their way in past firewalls and security systems .
but the warnings were directed at the wrong threat .
sumitomo had been threatened not from the outside , but from within .
left behind certainly , outside computer expertise was necessary to attack sumitomo .
but without help from people working for the bank , the attempt would have fallen at the first fence . "
i 'm struggling to think of a fraud case i 've ever done which did n't involve an insider .
it 's not just access that 's needed ; it 's understanding " dan morrison , mishcon de reya it was insiders who facilitated the assault , exploiting knowledge of the bank 's practices to enable the crooks to install keyloggers on the right machines .
the keyloggers - software which record every keypress to record passwords and map networks - were targetted on the bank 's swift systems , set up to control transactions across the universal bank transfer network .
and the same insiders may well have helped design the actual fraud : a string of 10 transfers , each of more than £ 10m , into accounts at other financial institutions around the world .
the plan was only foiled by a suspicious employee at an israeli bank who queried one of the transactions .
that allowed sumitomo to lock down its systems , prevent the transfers and equip police to make arrests .
outside in it remains unclear how high up the inside help went .
some experts believe the keylogging could have supplied sufficient information for a financial expert - and organised crime has little difficulty in recruiting such people - to plan the transactions .
others feel that since every bank 's systems are different , detailed inside knowledge would have been needed .
one thing , though , is unchallenged by everyone who investigates financial crime .
far too often companies concentrate on protecting their perimeters , and forget that their biggest problem may already be within their own walls .
" the biggest risk to corporations is n't hackers , and it 's not al-qaeda .
it 's their own people and their imaginations , " says dan morrison , fraud partner at london law firm mishcon de reya .
" i 'm struggling to think of a fraud case i 've ever done which did n't involve an insider .
it 's not just access that 's needed ; it 's understanding . "
in other words , whatever the similarities between how companies operate , the key for the fraudster is to spot the particular loopholes and opportunities a specific target offers .
" it 's very difficult to commit a major fraud against a company without internal assistance , " says simon dawson , head of corporate investigations at the risk advisory group .
more than money as the sumitomo case demonstrates , the insider concerned can be at any level .
rarely - perhaps one time in 10 - organised criminals will infiltrate someone into a company or a financial institution .
most of the time , according to detective chief superintendent ken farrow of the city of london police , the threat will come either from outsiders subverting existing staff - whether through bribery , blackmail or threats - or staff simply seeing the chance for themselves .
for the insider crook , the really tempting target may not be found in the company 's bank account but in its computer system .
an enterprising fraudster can walk out with intellectual property - client lists , new product details , pricing information and more - and deliver them to a new employer with minimal scruples to guarantee a fat raise . "

certainly , the case qualified as one of the biggest attempted frauds of all time .
but what really caught everyone 's attention that it was the bank 's computers and networks which had been compromised .
hackers , the headlines screamed , were burrowing their way in past firewalls and security systems .
but the warnings were directed at the wrong threat .
sumitomo had been threatened not from the outside , but from within .
left behind certainly , outside computer expertise was necessary to attack sumitomo .
but without help from people working for the bank , the attempt would have fallen at the first fence .
i 'm struggling to think of a fraud case i 've ever done which did n't involve an insider .
it 's not just access that 's needed ; it 's understanding dan morrison , mishcon de reya it was insiders who facilitated the assault , exploiting knowledge of the bank 's practices to enable the crooks to install keyloggers on the right machines .
the keyloggers - software which record every keypress to record passwords and map networks - were targetted on the bank 's swift systems , set up to control transactions across the universal bank transfer network .
and the same insiders may well have helped design the actual fraud : a string of 10 transfers , each of more than £ 10m , into accounts at other financial institutions around the world .
the plan was only foiled by a suspicious employee at an israeli bank who queried one of the transactions .
that allowed sumitomo to lock down its systems , prevent the transfers and equip police to make arrests .
outside in it remains unclear how high up the inside help went .
some experts believe the keylogging could have supplied sufficient information for a financial expert - and organised crime has little difficulty in recruiting such people - to plan the transactions .
others feel that since every bank 's systems are different , detailed inside knowledge would have been needed .
one thing , though , is unchallenged by everyone who investigates financial crime .
far too often companies concentrate on protecting their perimeters , and forget that their biggest problem may already be within their own walls .
prompt action led to one arrest in israel " the biggest risk to corporations is n't hackers , and it 's not al-qaeda .
it 's their own people and their imaginations , " says dan morrison , fraud partner at london law firm mishcon de reya .
" i 'm struggling to think of a fraud case i 've ever done which did n't involve an insider .
it 's not just access that 's needed ; it 's understanding . "
in other words , whatever the similarities between how companies operate , the key for the fraudster is to spot the particular loopholes and opportunities a specific target offers .
" it 's very difficult to commit a major fraud against a company without internal assistance , " says simon dawson , head of corporate investigations at the risk advisory group .
more than money as the sumitomo case demonstrates , the insider concerned can be at any level .
rarely - perhaps one time in 10 - organised criminals will infiltrate someone into a company or a financial institution .
most of the time , according to detective chief superintendent ken farrow of the city of london police , the threat will come either from outsiders subverting existing staff - whether through bribery , blackmail or threats - or staff simply seeing the chance for themselves .
for the insider crook , the really tempting target may not be found in the company 's bank account but in its computer system .
an enterprising fraudster can walk out with intellectual property - client lists , new product details , pricing information and more - and deliver them to a new employer with minimal scruples to guarantee a fat raise .

" this is a system to be placed in the centre of the living room around the world , " said ken kutaragi , head of sony 's game unit , at a news conference in los angeles announcing the playstation 3 .
this strategy parallels that of microsoft , which is keen to challenge playstation by also making its new xbox 360 a hub for all kinds of media .

more than 80 million units have been sold worldwide , with microsoft and nintendo trailing far behind .

it will be available in black , silver and white .

the controllers are wireless , using bluetooth technology .
people will be able to plug in other gadgets into the console via six usb ports .
the machine will be backwards compatible , meaning gamers will be able to play playstation 2 titles on it .

games line-up sony can count on the backing of some of the biggest names in the games business , such as electronic arts , the world 's biggest games publisher .
among the games in the pipeline are new versions of popular franchises such as racing title gran turismo , the role-playing game final fantasy and the gangster title the getaway .
several new titles are also planned , including the samurai epic heavenly sword by small uk developer ninja theory .
like other console makers , sony realises that the new wave of machines must offer more than prettier graphics .
key to their success will be the ability of game makers to tap into the power of these new digital workhorses to produce original and compelling gameplay .
developers are aiming to combine processing power and realistic graphics to better convey emotions and create what one game maker described as a truly immersive , living , breathing world .
sony 's announcement comes two days ahead of the electronic entertainment expo or e3 , the largest video games event in the world , which runs from 18 to 20 may .

economics minister heizo takenaka said it might no longer be appropriate to describe japan 's economy as being in " a soft patch " .
japan had a mild recession from april to september 2004 , and zero growth from october to december .
but economists warned japan 's recovery remains fragile and may be short-lived .
the annualised growth rate was 5.3 % , while the quarterly growth rate was the best since the first quarter of last year when it was 1.4 % .
stop-start growth ?
japan 's first-quarter growth rested on rises in consumer spending and on japanese companies building up their inventories .
inventory building suggests a more optimistic view of future prospects but without sizeable demand it is unlikely to continue .
exports fell 0.2 % in the january-to-march period due to slower demand for machinery from asia .
economists have put this down in part to china 's efforts to curb runaway growth .
japan 's economy " is going to be zigzagging for a while " , said yukari sato , chief economist of csfb securities japan .
she highlighted " uncertainty about external demand " due to " uncertainty about the american economy " .
" the question is whether this is a sustainable growth rate and i think the quick answer is no " ' , said hsbc securities japan chief economist peter morgan .
