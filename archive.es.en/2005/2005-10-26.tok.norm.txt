program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! german rap keeps it real tocotronic ushered in new era of german rock culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.10.2005 krautrock created a new sound for a new generation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influence of kraftwerk endures in avant-garde and pop music germany 's children of world war ii alchemized the revolutionary spirit of the 1960s into sound and vision , ushering in their own musical genre . " krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faust 's 1971 debut lp sold badly but secured a cult following equally significant during this time was what krautrock did n't draw from , namely the blues-rock purism purported by the likes of eric clapton 's cream or the rolling stones . " there were so many reasons to be different , " said michael rother of neu !
" we did n't discuss ' theories , ' we just got together and started playing and it happened .
we all knew about the velvet underground but somehow ended up with different structures . " foreshadow of things to come talking to the legendary music critic and writer lester bangs in 1975 , kraftwerk 's ralf hütter offered this explanation : " we were very lucky .
at the time there were electronic music concerts , happenings , the fluxus group , etc .
it was very normal ; we played on the same circuit , the galleries .
when we began we did n't have any engagements in the traditional music world , we were engaged in the artistic world , galleries , universities . " but it would be a mistake to characterize krautrock as so far out that it did n't make an impression on mainstream pop music . while the post-1960s music world was becoming ever more decadent , the germans moved in the opposite direction , becoming more stripped down , more inward .
holger czukay 's so-called " minimal-is-maximal " credo , which he pioneered in can , would soon become the status quo for much of the punk , post-punk and new-wave era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk 's 1978 album " man machine " impacted what would become synth pop and techno can , faust , neu ! and tangerine dream , which sold well in europe , cultivated a devoted circle of fans including other hip art-rockers such as david bowie , brian eno , iggy pop and negativeland .
likewise , a group of classical music students from düsseldorf known as kraftwerk -lrb- german for ' power plant ' -rrb- were bringing new visual art concepts to their music while at the same time tinkering with electronics , altering their moog synthesizers and building their own drum machines . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faust 's 1971 debut lp sold badly but secured a cult following equally significant during this time was what krautrock did n't draw from , namely the blues-rock purism purported by the likes of eric clapton 's cream or the rolling stones . " there were so many reasons to be different , " said michael rother of neu !
" we did n't discuss ' theories , ' we just got together and started playing and it happened .
we all knew about the velvet underground but somehow ended up with different structures . " foreshadow of things to come talking to the legendary music critic and writer lester bangs in 1975 , kraftwerk 's ralf hütter offered this explanation : " we were very lucky .
at the time there were electronic music concerts , happenings , the fluxus group , etc .
it was very normal ; we played on the same circuit , the galleries .
when we began we did n't have any engagements in the traditional music world , we were engaged in the artistic world , galleries , universities . " but it would be a mistake to characterize krautrock as so far out that it did n't make an impression on mainstream pop music . while the post-1960s music world was becoming ever more decadent , the germans moved in the opposite direction , becoming more stripped down , more inward .
holger czukay 's so-called " minimal-is-maximal " credo , which he pioneered in can , would soon become the status quo for much of the punk , post-punk and new-wave era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk 's 1978 album " man machine " impacted what would become synth pop and techno can , faust , neu ! and tangerine dream , which sold well in europe , cultivated a devoted circle of fans including other hip art-rockers such as david bowie , brian eno , iggy pop and negativeland .
likewise , a group of classical music students from düsseldorf known as kraftwerk -lrb- german for ' power plant ' -rrb- were bringing new visual art concepts to their music while at the same time tinkering with electronics , altering their moog synthesizers and building their own drum machines . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .

although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .

at an emotional meeting , the air was cleared between the two sides . the german soccer league 's front office managers finally got their wish .
less then two weeks after the less than spectacular displays against turkey and china they demanded a meeting with germany 's national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann to clear some things up about just how team germany should be run . on tuesday , klinsmann , who by no means was avoiding the rendezvous with the likes of bayern munich 's uli hoeness , met representatives from the league and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- to discuss just how the success of germany can best be guaranteed at next summer 's world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness has been one of the loudest critics of klinsmann after a round of talks in frankfurt that lasted two and a half hours , klinsmann called the discussion " lively and good . "
in the past month , he had drawn the wrath of bundesliga managers over a number of points including his continuing presence in california for long periods of time , the ongoing goalkeeper duel between oliver kahn and jens lehmann , and the intensive physical fitness program he and his assistant joachim löw have introduced . when all was said and done , the two sides , who had at times in the past two weeks used the mass media to launch volleys at the other , left the summit as " friends and not as parties with differences , " according to bayern munich 's chief director karl-heinz rummenigge . task force revival in an effort to improve communications between the two sides , which as could be seen in newspaper articles was anything but optimal , the task force has been reconvened to support klinsmann .
before the euro 2000 , a similar commission was established . seven people will head up the force whose spokesman will be none other than the outspoken hoeness .
also joining the group will be uli 's brother , dieter hoeness from hertha berlin and representatives from schalke , stuttgart , bremen and dortmund in addition to the league 's president werner hackmann . in addressing the criticisms that the league 's managers have been leveling at klinsmann , compromises were found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately a third man is between goalkeeping rivals jens lehmann -lrb- l -rrb- and oliver kahn " i 'll be present -lrb- in germany -rrb- when it 's important to move things ahead , " was his answer to his absence from the company .
nevertheless , when those " things " will happen remains unclear and he said he will come when necessary . as for the fitness program that he has brought partially from his long stay in the usa , when and how tests will be held would be better communicated . finally , as for the goalie debate that many say is preventing the formation of a cohesive unit , nothing has changed .
the rotation between kahn and lehmann will continue . and so little may have changed in reality but league reps and the coaching staff around jürgen klinsmann had the opportunity to get some things off their chest . in the typical , optimistic style of klinsmann he wrapped things up by saying that the team would have to find the " motivation and euphoria that we had before the confederations cup . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann to critics : tell it to my face germany coach jürgen klinsmann told his critics to deliver their grievances to his face not via the media after taking a sustained pummeling in the press for his stateside lifestyle .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faust 's 1971 debut lp sold badly but secured a cult following equally significant during this time was what krautrock did n't draw from , namely the blues-rock purism purported by the likes of eric clapton 's cream or the rolling stones . " there were so many reasons to be different , " said michael rother of neu !
" we did n't discuss ' theories , ' we just got together and started playing and it happened .
we all knew about the velvet underground but somehow ended up with different structures . " foreshadow of things to come talking to the legendary music critic and writer lester bangs in 1975 , kraftwerk 's ralf hütter offered this explanation : " we were very lucky .
at the time there were electronic music concerts , happenings , the fluxus group , etc .
it was very normal ; we played on the same circuit , the galleries .
when we began we did n't have any engagements in the traditional music world , we were engaged in the artistic world , galleries , universities . " but it would be a mistake to characterize krautrock as so far out that it did n't make an impression on mainstream pop music . while the post-1960s music world was becoming ever more decadent , the germans moved in the opposite direction , becoming more stripped down , more inward .
holger czukay 's so-called " minimal-is-maximal " credo , which he pioneered in can , would soon become the status quo for much of the punk , post-punk and new-wave era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk 's 1978 album " man machine " impacted what would become synth pop and techno can , faust , neu ! and tangerine dream , which sold well in europe , cultivated a devoted circle of fans including other hip art-rockers such as david bowie , brian eno , iggy pop and negativeland .
likewise , a group of classical music students from düsseldorf known as kraftwerk -lrb- german for ' power plant ' -rrb- were bringing new visual art concepts to their music while at the same time tinkering with electronics , altering their moog synthesizers and building their own drum machines . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

an ocean pipeline would bypass the three transit countries by pumping gas directly from russia to germany via the baltic sea , thus robbing them of transfer costs . adamkus and the lithuanian prime minister algirdas brazaukas have both voiced their opposition to the pipeline , which is scheduled for completion by 2010 .
in an interview on lithuanian television ahead of his visit to berlin , adamkus said there was still time to rethink the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuanian president valdas adamkus " although the agreement exists on paper , work has not yet begun .
that means it is still possible to reconsider the issue . "
but in chancellor schröder , his hopes met with an unresponsive audience . sovereign right " germany has a sovereign right to take steps to make sure it has reliable and sustainable energy resources " , schröder said in a statement issued by his office . ahead of his arrival in berlin , adamkus this week complained that " germany , a member of the european union , reached and signed an agreement with russia without informing poland and lithuania . " brazauskas echoed the sentiment in an interview with germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" during the preparation of the project nobody asked our opinion even once .
everything was done behind our backs , " he said .
" i do n't know who is trying to play around with us , russia , or maybe germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern european countries want a land route eastern european critics say it would make more sense to modernize and extend the two existing pipelines which already run through the three traditional transit countries .
poland , ukraine and the baltic states have also proposed an alternative land route .
the " bernstein pipeline " would pass run from russia to poland , passing through latvia and lithuania . brazauskas has also warned of the dangers of an underwater project , which he says risks disturbing tons of chemical weapons sunk in the baltic sea by the russians following world war ii . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

" we must revive the european spirit and give it renewed impetus , " he wrote .
" europe can not stand still while its competitors forge ahead .
to meet their expectations we must reassert our belief in a powerful europe of growth and jobs that strengthens us . " but chirac pre-empted any suggestion that europe rip down its long-established social security systems in favor of what many europeans regard as a ruthless " anglo-saxon " model of untethered markets . " the society europe strives for is centred on human dignity .
were we to give up this ideal we would betray our heritage , " he said . " france will therefore never let europe become a mere free-trade area .
we want a political and social europe rooted in solidarity . " spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero , writing in the guardian newspaper , said he intended to broaden the debate to include illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa - a serious issue for madrid . " status quo not an option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission condemned the bloc 's high jobless rate in its latest document informing the debate at hampton court is a paper from the european commission - just 15 pages long - which argues that " europe must reform and modernize its policies to preserve its values . " it said it is " unacceptable " that 19 million europeans are jobless , and that the european union " is not closing the gap with the united states , " let alone china and india . at the same time , it said , europe must act now to bear the burden of a shrinking and ageing population - a combination that could , it projected , send growth down to 1.25 percent in 2040 , compared with 2.0-2.5 percent currently . " the status quo is not an option , " the european commission 's representative in london , reijo kemppinen , told the foreign press association in london on wednesday . " we have weaknesses in education , research , innovation and productivity which are holding back labor markets and economic performance , " he said .

" we must revive the european spirit and give it renewed impetus , " he wrote .
" europe can not stand still while its competitors forge ahead .
to meet their expectations we must reassert our belief in a powerful europe of growth and jobs that strengthens us .

were we to give up this ideal we would betray our heritage , " he said . " france will therefore never let europe become a mere free-trade area .

" the status quo is not an option , " the european commission 's representative in london , reijo kemppinen , told the foreign press association in london on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 26.10.2005 league managers and klinsmann clear the air großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has taken a lot of flak from the media and managers alike the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .
at an emotional meeting , the air was cleared between the two sides . the german soccer league 's front office managers finally got their wish .
less then two weeks after the less than spectacular displays against turkey and china they demanded a meeting with germany 's national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann to clear some things up about just how team germany should be run . on tuesday , klinsmann , who by no means was avoiding the rendezvous with the likes of bayern munich 's uli hoeness , met representatives from the league and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- to discuss just how the success of germany can best be guaranteed at next summer 's world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness has been one of the loudest critics of klinsmann after a round of talks in frankfurt that lasted two and a half hours , klinsmann called the discussion " lively and good . "
in the past month , he had drawn the wrath of bundesliga managers over a number of points including his continuing presence in california for long periods of time , the ongoing goalkeeper duel between oliver kahn and jens lehmann , and the intensive physical fitness program he and his assistant joachim löw have introduced . when all was said and done , the two sides , who had at times in the past two weeks used the mass media to launch volleys at the other , left the summit as " friends and not as parties with differences , " according to bayern munich 's chief director karl-heinz rummenigge . task force revival in an effort to improve communications between the two sides , which as could be seen in newspaper articles was anything but optimal , the task force has been reconvened to support klinsmann .
before the euro 2000 , a similar commission was established . seven people will head up the force whose spokesman will be none other than the outspoken hoeness .
also joining the group will be uli 's brother , dieter hoeness from hertha berlin and representatives from schalke , stuttgart , bremen and dortmund in addition to the league 's president werner hackmann . in addressing the criticisms that the league 's managers have been leveling at klinsmann , compromises were found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately a third man is between goalkeeping rivals jens lehmann -lrb- l -rrb- and oliver kahn " i 'll be present -lrb- in germany -rrb- when it 's important to move things ahead , " was his answer to his absence from the company .
nevertheless , when those " things " will happen remains unclear and he said he will come when necessary . as for the fitness program that he has brought partially from his long stay in the usa , when and how tests will be held would be better communicated . finally , as for the goalie debate that many say is preventing the formation of a cohesive unit , nothing has changed .
the rotation between kahn and lehmann will continue . and so little may have changed in reality but league reps and the coaching staff around jürgen klinsmann had the opportunity to get some things off their chest . in the typical , optimistic style of klinsmann he wrapped things up by saying that the team would have to find the " motivation and euphoria that we had before the confederations cup . " dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann to critics : tell it to my face germany coach jürgen klinsmann told his critics to deliver their grievances to his face not via the media after taking a sustained pummeling in the press for his stateside lifestyle .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .

german officials have since said that they are almost certain the birds died from poison and carried a harmless flu virus . concern was also raised by the discovery of a lethal strain of bird flu in a parrot that died while in quarantine in britain last week . the eu import ban was agreed in brussels by veterinary experts from the eu 's 25 member states , based on proposals drawn up urgently by the european commission following the british case . " these measures ... aim to strengthen further the eu 's defenses against avian influenza , " said the commission in a statement . commercial , private birds ha n dled differe n tly the new ban covers captive live birds other than poultry imported for commercial purposes , while separate measures were agreed for private imports of pet birds , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 virus under the microscope the eu has bolstered its defenses against bird flu after the h5n1 lethal strain of the virus , which has killed over 60 people in asia since 2003 , was found in turkey and romania . the sense of urgency was heightened further when british authorities confirmed at the end of last week that a parrot which died while in quarantine was infected with the deadly asian strain . croatia n poultry ba n n ed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swans in croatia were infected with h5n1 in a separate measure to stop the disease spreading the eu commission earlier tuesday confirmed an eu ban on live poultry imports from croatia , after a second outbreak was detected there this week .
on wednesday , eu officials confirmed that animals in the balkan country had been infected with the h5n1 virus . the global ban on pet bird imports , confirmed late tuesday by the eu 's standing committee on the food chain and animal health , will come into force as soon as formally approved by the eu commission in the next few days . health certificates n eeded under the commission 's proposal , individuals could only import five birds as pets and would have to provide certificates proving that the birds were not infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vaccine can only be developed after an outbreak " we feel that the main risk is through commercial imports , which are large scale imports , " commission spokesman philip tod said . about 232,000 pet and exotic birds have been imported into the eu over the past three months . health experts fear that a lethal strain of bird flu may at some stage jump the species barrier in europe and mix with normal influenza genes to create a pandemic that would be difficult to control . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dead birds raise virus scare in germany the discovery of more than 20 dead birds at a pond in western germany has raised fears that avian flu may have already found its way into the country , though officials are urging the public to remain calm .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faust 's 1971 debut lp sold badly but secured a cult following equally significant during this time was what krautrock did n't draw from , namely the blues-rock purism purported by the likes of eric clapton 's cream or the rolling stones . " there were so many reasons to be different , " said michael rother of neu !
" we did n't discuss ' theories , ' we just got together and started playing and it happened .
we all knew about the velvet underground but somehow ended up with different structures . " foreshadow of things to come talking to the legendary music critic and writer lester bangs in 1975 , kraftwerk 's ralf hütter offered this explanation : " we were very lucky .
at the time there were electronic music concerts , happenings , the fluxus group , etc .
it was very normal ; we played on the same circuit , the galleries .
when we began we did n't have any engagements in the traditional music world , we were engaged in the artistic world , galleries , universities . " but it would be a mistake to characterize krautrock as so far out that it did n't make an impression on mainstream pop music . while the post-1960s music world was becoming ever more decadent , the germans moved in the opposite direction , becoming more stripped down , more inward .
holger czukay 's so-called " minimal-is-maximal " credo , which he pioneered in can , would soon become the status quo for much of the punk , post-punk and new-wave era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk 's 1978 album " man machine " impacted what would become synth pop and techno can , faust , neu ! and tangerine dream , which sold well in europe , cultivated a devoted circle of fans including other hip art-rockers such as david bowie , brian eno , iggy pop and negativeland .
likewise , a group of classical music students from düsseldorf known as kraftwerk -lrb- german for ' power plant ' -rrb- were bringing new visual art concepts to their music while at the same time tinkering with electronics , altering their moog synthesizers and building their own drum machines . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

an ocean pipeline would bypass the three transit countries by pumping gas directly from russia to germany via the baltic sea , thus robbing them of transfer costs . adamkus and the lithuanian prime minister algirdas brazaukas have both voiced their opposition to the pipeline , which is scheduled for completion by 2010 .

bombs were falling all around ilse walter and her family .
in the inferno of dresden tens of thousands of people fell victim to the allied bombing raid .

6 , 1945 dresden 's famous church with its often admired sandstone roofed dome had stood proudly in the city center for 200 years , but when allied planes dropped their bombs in one of the most severe attacks in world war ii , it was hollowed out .
after the air raid , there was hope the frauenkirche had survived , but on february 15 , 1945 at 10:00 a.m. the church eventually collapsed .
up to this point the city of dresden had only experienced the horrors of war through stories told by frontier soldiers or reports of eastern europe refugees , who thought they were safe in dresden .
ilse walter recalls the last days before the dresden bombing : " it was reported that bombing squads were approaching hannover / braunschweig .

" february 13 , 1945 was a day that reminded me of pre-spring .
i still remember every detail .
my family and i were sitting at the table and were listening to the radio program .
that evening the rundfunk transmitted a program that created a rather happy atmosphere when suddenly during a song named ' on the wings of colored dreams ' we heard the sirens . "
bombs were falling all around ilse walter and her family .
in the inferno of dresden tens of thousands of people fell victim to the allied bombing raid .
some 15 square kilometers of the historical city center were turned into nothing but a gigantic heap of debris .
the former palace , the zwinger , the semper opera , the arts gallery and the theatre were reduced to smoking ruins .
even the monumental frauenkirche , whose impressive dome towered above the silhouette of the city , was leveled in the bombing .
destroying history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us planes drop bombs near dresden on feb .
6 , 1945 dresden 's famous church with its often admired sandstone roofed dome had stood proudly in the city center for 200 years , but when allied planes dropped their bombs in one of the most severe attacks in world war ii , it was hollowed out .
after the air raid , there was hope the frauenkirche had survived , but on february 15 , 1945 at 10:00 a.m. the church eventually collapsed .
up to this point the city of dresden had only experienced the horrors of war through stories told by frontier soldiers or reports of eastern europe refugees , who thought they were safe in dresden .
ilse walter recalls the last days before the dresden bombing : " it was reported that bombing squads were approaching hannover / braunschweig .
yes , hannover / braunschweig , we were used to hearing this every day .
for us in dresden these cities were far , far away . "
senseless bombing from a military point of view the bombing of dresden was completely senseless .
the plan of splitting germany had been finished long before .
the protocol of london had already set the borderlines of the occupation zones in autumn 1944 and the end of the war was obvious for everyone , even though berlin still professed otherwise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolished dresden after the air raids on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 dresden was not a garrison city and its industry was located far away from the city 's core .
still today there is a question mark over the motives for the destruction of one of europe 's sites of cultural heritage .
many speculations and rumors concerning the attack existed and still exist today .
winston churchill said at the time : " it seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of german cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror , should be reviewed .
otherwise we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land .
i feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives ... rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction . "
rebuilding dresden the socialist way after the war in 1945 east german leader walter ulbricht dreamed of a socialist dresden with wide boulevards and large squares for state functions .
however , art historians , city planners and protectors of dresden 's historical architecture fought for a thorough reconstruction of the baroque city .
their dream began to materialize on aug .
9 , 1945 when renovation work began on the zwinger palace and theater .
the frauenkirche , however , did not enjoy the same fate .
a symbol of destruction and rebirth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dome of the frauenkirche in dresden unlike many other churches in the german democratic republic which were demolished during the 40 years of communist rule , the thirteen-meter high skeleton of the frauenkirche was preserved as a reminder of war 's destruction .
after the fall of the wall in 1990 a foundation was established to gather money for the reconstruction of dresden 's famous church .
since then , vast sums of money have poured in from across germany and around the world , and the church has slowly , piece by piece , been rebuilt .
on feb .
13 , 2006 , 61 years after ilse walter witnessed the destruction of the city 's emblem right in front of her eyes , the frauenkirche will once again dominate dresden 's historic sky line . gerda gericke -lrb- lucas -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden - a city risen from the ashes looking back on dresden 's historical development , it is remarkable that the city has recovered and developed into a thriving metropolis in the economically deprived region of eastern germany .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faust 's 1971 debut lp sold badly but secured a cult following equally significant during this time was what krautrock did n't draw from , namely the blues-rock purism purported by the likes of eric clapton 's cream or the rolling stones . " there were so many reasons to be different , " said michael rother of neu !
" we did n't discuss ' theories , ' we just got together and started playing and it happened .
we all knew about the velvet underground but somehow ended up with different structures . " foreshadow of things to come talking to the legendary music critic and writer lester bangs in 1975 , kraftwerk 's ralf hütter offered this explanation : " we were very lucky .
at the time there were electronic music concerts , happenings , the fluxus group , etc .
it was very normal ; we played on the same circuit , the galleries .
when we began we did n't have any engagements in the traditional music world , we were engaged in the artistic world , galleries , universities . " but it would be a mistake to characterize krautrock as so far out that it did n't make an impression on mainstream pop music . while the post-1960s music world was becoming ever more decadent , the germans moved in the opposite direction , becoming more stripped down , more inward .
holger czukay 's so-called " minimal-is-maximal " credo , which he pioneered in can , would soon become the status quo for much of the punk , post-punk and new-wave era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk 's 1978 album " man machine " impacted what would become synth pop and techno can , faust , neu ! and tangerine dream , which sold well in europe , cultivated a devoted circle of fans including other hip art-rockers such as david bowie , brian eno , iggy pop and negativeland .
likewise , a group of classical music students from düsseldorf known as kraftwerk -lrb- german for ' power plant ' -rrb- were bringing new visual art concepts to their music while at the same time tinkering with electronics , altering their moog synthesizers and building their own drum machines . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

" we must revive the european spirit and give it renewed impetus , " he wrote .
" europe can not stand still while its competitors forge ahead .
to meet their expectations we must reassert our belief in a powerful europe of growth and jobs that strengthens us . " but chirac pre-empted any suggestion that europe rip down its long-established social security systems in favor of what many europeans regard as a ruthless " anglo-saxon " model of untethered markets . " the society europe strives for is centred on human dignity .
were we to give up this ideal we would betray our heritage , " he said . " france will therefore never let europe become a mere free-trade area .
we want a political and social europe rooted in solidarity . " spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero , writing in the guardian newspaper , said he intended to broaden the debate to include illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa - a serious issue for madrid . " status quo not an option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission condemned the bloc 's high jobless rate in its latest document informing the debate at hampton court is a paper from the european commission - just 15 pages long - which argues that " europe must reform and modernize its policies to preserve its values . " it said it is " unacceptable " that 19 million europeans are jobless , and that the european union " is not closing the gap with the united states , " let alone china and india . at the same time , it said , europe must act now to bear the burden of a shrinking and ageing population - a combination that could , it projected , send growth down to 1.25 percent in 2040 , compared with 2.0-2.5 percent currently . " the status quo is not an option , " the european commission 's representative in london , reijo kemppinen , told the foreign press association in london on wednesday . " we have weaknesses in education , research , innovation and productivity which are holding back labor markets and economic performance , " he said .

" we must revive the european spirit and give it renewed impetus , " he wrote .
" europe can not stand still while its competitors forge ahead .
to meet their expectations we must reassert our belief in a powerful europe of growth and jobs that strengthens us . " but chirac pre-empted any suggestion that europe rip down its long-established social security systems in favor of what many europeans regard as a ruthless " anglo-saxon " model of untethered markets . " the society europe strives for is centred on human dignity .
were we to give up this ideal we would betray our heritage , " he said . " france will therefore never let europe become a mere free-trade area .
we want a political and social europe rooted in solidarity . " spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero , writing in the guardian newspaper , said he intended to broaden the debate to include illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa - a serious issue for madrid . " status quo not an option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission condemned the bloc 's high jobless rate in its latest document informing the debate at hampton court is a paper from the european commission - just 15 pages long - which argues that " europe must reform and modernize its policies to preserve its values . " it said it is " unacceptable " that 19 million europeans are jobless , and that the european union " is not closing the gap with the united states , " let alone china and india . at the same time , it said , europe must act now to bear the burden of a shrinking and ageing population - a combination that could , it projected , send growth down to 1.25 percent in 2040 , compared with 2.0-2.5 percent currently . " the status quo is not an option , " the european commission 's representative in london , reijo kemppinen , told the foreign press association in london on wednesday . " we have weaknesses in education , research , innovation and productivity which are holding back labor markets and economic performance , " he said .

in the past month , he had drawn the wrath of bundesliga managers over a number of points including his continuing presence in california for long periods of time , the ongoing goalkeeper duel between oliver kahn and jens lehmann , and the intensive physical fitness program he and his assistant joachim löw have introduced . when all was said and done , the two sides , who had at times in the past two weeks used the mass media to launch volleys at the other , left the summit as " friends and not as parties with differences , " according to bayern munich 's chief director karl-heinz rummenigge . task force revival in an effort to improve communications between the two sides , which as could be seen in newspaper articles was anything but optimal , the task force has been reconvened to support klinsmann .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

an ocean pipeline would bypass the three transit countries by pumping gas directly from russia to germany via the baltic sea , thus robbing them of transfer costs . adamkus and the lithuanian prime minister algirdas brazaukas have both voiced their opposition to the pipeline , which is scheduled for completion by 2010 .

an ocean pipeline would bypass the three transit countries by pumping gas directly from russia to germany via the baltic sea , thus robbing them of transfer costs . adamkus and the lithuanian prime minister algirdas brazaukas have both voiced their opposition to the pipeline , which is scheduled for completion by 2010 .
in an interview on lithuanian television ahead of his visit to berlin , adamkus said there was still time to rethink the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuanian president valdas adamkus " although the agreement exists on paper , work has not yet begun .
that means it is still possible to reconsider the issue . "
but in chancellor schröder , his hopes met with an unresponsive audience . sovereign right " germany has a sovereign right to take steps to make sure it has reliable and sustainable energy resources " , schröder said in a statement issued by his office . ahead of his arrival in berlin , adamkus this week complained that " germany , a member of the european union , reached and signed an agreement with russia without informing poland and lithuania . " brazauskas echoed the sentiment in an interview with germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" during the preparation of the project nobody asked our opinion even once .
everything was done behind our backs , " he said .
" i do n't know who is trying to play around with us , russia , or maybe germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern european countries want a land route eastern european critics say it would make more sense to modernize and extend the two existing pipelines which already run through the three traditional transit countries .
poland , ukraine and the baltic states have also proposed an alternative land route .
the " bernstein pipeline " would pass run from russia to poland , passing through latvia and lithuania . brazauskas has also warned of the dangers of an underwater project , which he says risks disturbing tons of chemical weapons sunk in the baltic sea by the russians following world war ii . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .

" we must revive the european spirit and give it renewed impetus , " he wrote .
" europe can not stand still while its competitors forge ahead .
to meet their expectations we must reassert our belief in a powerful europe of growth and jobs that strengthens us . " but chirac pre-empted any suggestion that europe rip down its long-established social security systems in favor of what many europeans regard as a ruthless " anglo-saxon " model of untethered markets . " the society europe strives for is centred on human dignity .
were we to give up this ideal we would betray our heritage , " he said . " france will therefore never let europe become a mere free-trade area .
we want a political and social europe rooted in solidarity . " spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero , writing in the guardian newspaper , said he intended to broaden the debate to include illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa - a serious issue for madrid . " status quo not an option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission condemned the bloc 's high jobless rate in its latest document informing the debate at hampton court is a paper from the european commission - just 15 pages long - which argues that " europe must reform and modernize its policies to preserve its values . " it said it is " unacceptable " that 19 million europeans are jobless , and that the european union " is not closing the gap with the united states , " let alone china and india . at the same time , it said , europe must act now to bear the burden of a shrinking and ageing population - a combination that could , it projected , send growth down to 1.25 percent in 2040 , compared with 2.0-2.5 percent currently . " the status quo is not an option , " the european commission 's representative in london , reijo kemppinen , told the foreign press association in london on wednesday . " we have weaknesses in education , research , innovation and productivity which are holding back labor markets and economic performance , " he said .

" we must revive the european spirit and give it renewed impetus , " he wrote .
" europe can not stand still while its competitors forge ahead .
to meet their expectations we must reassert our belief in a powerful europe of growth and jobs that strengthens us . " but chirac pre-empted any suggestion that europe rip down its long-established social security systems in favor of what many europeans regard as a ruthless " anglo-saxon " model of untethered markets . " the society europe strives for is centred on human dignity .
were we to give up this ideal we would betray our heritage , " he said . " france will therefore never let europe become a mere free-trade area .
we want a political and social europe rooted in solidarity . " spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero , writing in the guardian newspaper , said he intended to broaden the debate to include illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa - a serious issue for madrid . " status quo not an option " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission condemned the bloc 's high jobless rate in its latest document informing the debate at hampton court is a paper from the european commission - just 15 pages long - which argues that " europe must reform and modernize its policies to preserve its values . " it said it is " unacceptable " that 19 million europeans are jobless , and that the european union " is not closing the gap with the united states , " let alone china and india . at the same time , it said , europe must act now to bear the burden of a shrinking and ageing population - a combination that could , it projected , send growth down to 1.25 percent in 2040 , compared with 2.0-2.5 percent currently . " the status quo is not an option , " the european commission 's representative in london , reijo kemppinen , told the foreign press association in london on wednesday . " we have weaknesses in education , research , innovation and productivity which are holding back labor markets and economic performance , " he said .
" we have to close ranks and find new ways to address these issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! german rap keeps it real tocotronic ushered in new era of german rock culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.10.2005 krautrock created a new sound for a new generation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the influence of kraftwerk endures in avant-garde and pop music germany 's children of world war ii alchemized the revolutionary spirit of the 1960s into sound and vision , ushering in their own musical genre . " krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faust 's 1971 debut lp sold badly but secured a cult following equally significant during this time was what krautrock did n't draw from , namely the blues-rock purism purported by the likes of eric clapton 's cream or the rolling stones .

" we must revive the european spirit and give it renewed impetus , " he wrote .
" europe can not stand still while its competitors forge ahead .
to meet their expectations we must reassert our belief in a powerful europe of growth and jobs that strengthens us . " but chirac pre-empted any suggestion that europe rip down its long-established social security systems in favor of what many europeans regard as a ruthless " anglo-saxon " model of untethered markets . " the society europe strives for is centred on human dignity .
were we to give up this ideal we would betray our heritage , " he said . " france will therefore never let europe become a mere free-trade area .
we want a political and social europe rooted in solidarity . " spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero , writing in the guardian newspaper , said he intended to broaden the debate to include illegal immigration from sub-saharan africa - a serious issue for madrid .

at an emotional meeting , the air was cleared between the two sides . the german soccer league 's front office managers finally got their wish .
less then two weeks after the less than spectacular displays against turkey and china they demanded a meeting with germany 's national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann to clear some things up about just how team germany should be run . on tuesday , klinsmann , who by no means was avoiding the rendezvous with the likes of bayern munich 's uli hoeness , met representatives from the league and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- to discuss just how the success of germany can best be guaranteed at next summer 's world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness has been one of the loudest critics of klinsmann after a round of talks in frankfurt that lasted two and a half hours , klinsmann called the discussion " lively and good . "
in the past month , he had drawn the wrath of bundesliga managers over a number of points including his continuing presence in california for long periods of time , the ongoing goalkeeper duel between oliver kahn and jens lehmann , and the intensive physical fitness program he and his assistant joachim löw have introduced . when all was said and done , the two sides , who had at times in the past two weeks used the mass media to launch volleys at the other , left the summit as " friends and not as parties with differences , " according to bayern munich 's chief director karl-heinz rummenigge . task force revival in an effort to improve communications between the two sides , which as could be seen in newspaper articles was anything but optimal , the task force has been reconvened to support klinsmann .
before the euro 2000 , a similar commission was established . seven people will head up the force whose spokesman will be none other than the outspoken hoeness .
also joining the group will be uli 's brother , dieter hoeness from hertha berlin and representatives from schalke , stuttgart , bremen and dortmund in addition to the league 's president werner hackmann . in addressing the criticisms that the league 's managers have been leveling at klinsmann , compromises were found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately a third man is between goalkeeping rivals jens lehmann -lrb- l -rrb- and oliver kahn " i 'll be present -lrb- in germany -rrb- when it 's important to move things ahead , " was his answer to his absence from the company .
nevertheless , when those " things " will happen remains unclear and he said he will come when necessary . as for the fitness program that he has brought partially from his long stay in the usa , when and how tests will be held would be better communicated . finally , as for the goalie debate that many say is preventing the formation of a cohesive unit , nothing has changed .
the rotation between kahn and lehmann will continue . and so little may have changed in reality but league reps and the coaching staff around jürgen klinsmann had the opportunity to get some things off their chest . in the typical , optimistic style of klinsmann he wrapped things up by saying that the team would have to find the " motivation and euphoria that we had before the confederations cup .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faust 's 1971 debut lp sold badly but secured a cult following equally significant during this time was what krautrock did n't draw from , namely the blues-rock purism purported by the likes of eric clapton 's cream or the rolling stones . " there were so many reasons to be different , " said michael rother of neu !
" we did n't discuss ' theories , ' we just got together and started playing and it happened .
we all knew about the velvet underground but somehow ended up with different structures . " foreshadow of things to come talking to the legendary music critic and writer lester bangs in 1975 , kraftwerk 's ralf hütter offered this explanation : " we were very lucky .
at the time there were electronic music concerts , happenings , the fluxus group , etc .
it was very normal ; we played on the same circuit , the galleries .
when we began we did n't have any engagements in the traditional music world , we were engaged in the artistic world , galleries , universities . " but it would be a mistake to characterize krautrock as so far out that it did n't make an impression on mainstream pop music . while the post-1960s music world was becoming ever more decadent , the germans moved in the opposite direction , becoming more stripped down , more inward .
holger czukay 's so-called " minimal-is-maximal " credo , which he pioneered in can , would soon become the status quo for much of the punk , post-punk and new-wave era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk 's 1978 album " man machine " impacted what would become synth pop and techno can , faust , neu ! and tangerine dream , which sold well in europe , cultivated a devoted circle of fans including other hip art-rockers such as david bowie , brian eno , iggy pop and negativeland .
likewise , a group of classical music students from düsseldorf known as kraftwerk -lrb- german for ' power plant ' -rrb- were bringing new visual art concepts to their music while at the same time tinkering with electronics , altering their moog synthesizers and building their own drum machines . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

an ocean pipeline would bypass the three transit countries by pumping gas directly from russia to germany via the baltic sea , thus robbing them of transfer costs . adamkus and the lithuanian prime minister algirdas brazaukas have both voiced their opposition to the pipeline , which is scheduled for completion by 2010 .
in an interview on lithuanian television ahead of his visit to berlin , adamkus said there was still time to rethink the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuanian president valdas adamkus " although the agreement exists on paper , work has not yet begun .
that means it is still possible to reconsider the issue . "
but in chancellor schröder , his hopes met with an unresponsive audience . sovereign right " germany has a sovereign right to take steps to make sure it has reliable and sustainable energy resources " , schröder said in a statement issued by his office . ahead of his arrival in berlin , adamkus this week complained that " germany , a member of the european union , reached and signed an agreement with russia without informing poland and lithuania . " brazauskas echoed the sentiment in an interview with germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" during the preparation of the project nobody asked our opinion even once .
everything was done behind our backs , " he said .
" i do n't know who is trying to play around with us , russia , or maybe germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern european countries want a land route eastern european critics say it would make more sense to modernize and extend the two existing pipelines which already run through the three traditional transit countries .
poland , ukraine and the baltic states have also proposed an alternative land route .
the " bernstein pipeline " would pass run from russia to poland , passing through latvia and lithuania . brazauskas has also warned of the dangers of an underwater project , which he says risks disturbing tons of chemical weapons sunk in the baltic sea by the russians following world war ii . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

german officials have since said that they are almost certain the birds died from poison and carried a harmless flu virus . concern was also raised by the discovery of a lethal strain of bird flu in a parrot that died while in quarantine in britain last week . the eu import ban was agreed in brussels by veterinary experts from the eu 's 25 member states , based on proposals drawn up urgently by the european commission following the british case . " these measures ... aim to strengthen further the eu 's defenses against avian influenza , " said the commission in a statement . commercial , private birds ha n dled differe n tly the new ban covers captive live birds other than poultry imported for commercial purposes , while separate measures were agreed for private imports of pet birds , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 virus under the microscope the eu has bolstered its defenses against bird flu after the h5n1 lethal strain of the virus , which has killed over 60 people in asia since 2003 , was found in turkey and romania . the sense of urgency was heightened further when british authorities confirmed at the end of last week that a parrot which died while in quarantine was infected with the deadly asian strain . croatia n poultry ba n n ed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swans in croatia were infected with h5n1 in a separate measure to stop the disease spreading the eu commission earlier tuesday confirmed an eu ban on live poultry imports from croatia , after a second outbreak was detected there this week .

an ocean pipeline would bypass the three transit countries by pumping gas directly from russia to germany via the baltic sea , thus robbing them of transfer costs . adamkus and the lithuanian prime minister algirdas brazaukas have both voiced their opposition to the pipeline , which is scheduled for completion by 2010 .
in an interview on lithuanian television ahead of his visit to berlin , adamkus said there was still time to rethink the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuanian president valdas adamkus " although the agreement exists on paper , work has not yet begun .
that means it is still possible to reconsider the issue . "
but in chancellor schröder , his hopes met with an unresponsive audience . sovereign right " germany has a sovereign right to take steps to make sure it has reliable and sustainable energy resources " , schröder said in a statement issued by his office . ahead of his arrival in berlin , adamkus this week complained that " germany , a member of the european union , reached and signed an agreement with russia without informing poland and lithuania . " brazauskas echoed the sentiment in an interview with germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" during the preparation of the project nobody asked our opinion even once .
everything was done behind our backs , " he said .
" i do n't know who is trying to play around with us , russia , or maybe germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern european countries want a land route eastern european critics say it would make more sense to modernize and extend the two existing pipelines which already run through the three traditional transit countries .
poland , ukraine and the baltic states have also proposed an alternative land route .
the " bernstein pipeline " would pass run from russia to poland , passing through latvia and lithuania . brazauskas has also warned of the dangers of an underwater project , which he says risks disturbing tons of chemical weapons sunk in the baltic sea by the russians following world war ii . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

german officials have since said that they are almost certain the birds died from poison and carried a harmless flu virus . concern was also raised by the discovery of a lethal strain of bird flu in a parrot that died while in quarantine in britain last week . the eu import ban was agreed in brussels by veterinary experts from the eu 's 25 member states , based on proposals drawn up urgently by the european commission following the british case . " these measures ... aim to strengthen further the eu 's defenses against avian influenza , " said the commission in a statement . commercial , private birds ha n dled differe n tly the new ban covers captive live birds other than poultry imported for commercial purposes , while separate measures were agreed for private imports of pet birds , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 virus under the microscope the eu has bolstered its defenses against bird flu after the h5n1 lethal strain of the virus , which has killed over 60 people in asia since 2003 , was found in turkey and romania . the sense of urgency was heightened further when british authorities confirmed at the end of last week that a parrot which died while in quarantine was infected with the deadly asian strain . croatia n poultry ba n n ed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swans in croatia were infected with h5n1 in a separate measure to stop the disease spreading the eu commission earlier tuesday confirmed an eu ban on live poultry imports from croatia , after a second outbreak was detected there this week .
on wednesday , eu officials confirmed that animals in the balkan country had been infected with the h5n1 virus . the global ban on pet bird imports , confirmed late tuesday by the eu 's standing committee on the food chain and animal health , will come into force as soon as formally approved by the eu commission in the next few days . health certificates n eeded under the commission 's proposal , individuals could only import five birds as pets and would have to provide certificates proving that the birds were not infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vaccine can only be developed after an outbreak " we feel that the main risk is through commercial imports , which are large scale imports , " commission spokesman philip tod said . about 232,000 pet and exotic birds have been imported into the eu over the past three months . health experts fear that a lethal strain of bird flu may at some stage jump the species barrier in europe and mix with normal influenza genes to create a pandemic that would be difficult to control . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dead birds raise virus scare in germany the discovery of more than 20 dead birds at a pond in western germany has raised fears that avian flu may have already found its way into the country , though officials are urging the public to remain calm .

german officials have since said that they are almost certain the birds died from poison and carried a harmless flu virus . concern was also raised by the discovery of a lethal strain of bird flu in a parrot that died while in quarantine in britain last week . the eu import ban was agreed in brussels by veterinary experts from the eu 's 25 member states , based on proposals drawn up urgently by the european commission following the british case . " these measures ... aim to strengthen further the eu 's defenses against avian influenza , " said the commission in a statement . commercial , private birds ha n dled differe n tly the new ban covers captive live birds other than poultry imported for commercial purposes , while separate measures were agreed for private imports of pet birds , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 virus under the microscope the eu has bolstered its defenses against bird flu after the h5n1 lethal strain of the virus , which has killed over 60 people in asia since 2003 , was found in turkey and romania . the sense of urgency was heightened further when british authorities confirmed at the end of last week that a parrot which died while in quarantine was infected with the deadly asian strain . croatia n poultry ba n n ed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swans in croatia were infected with h5n1 in a separate measure to stop the disease spreading the eu commission earlier tuesday confirmed an eu ban on live poultry imports from croatia , after a second outbreak was detected there this week .

an ocean pipeline would bypass the three transit countries by pumping gas directly from russia to germany via the baltic sea , thus robbing them of transfer costs . adamkus and the lithuanian prime minister algirdas brazaukas have both voiced their opposition to the pipeline , which is scheduled for completion by 2010 .
in an interview on lithuanian television ahead of his visit to berlin , adamkus said there was still time to rethink the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuanian president valdas adamkus " although the agreement exists on paper , work has not yet begun .
that means it is still possible to reconsider the issue . "
but in chancellor schröder , his hopes met with an unresponsive audience . sovereign right " germany has a sovereign right to take steps to make sure it has reliable and sustainable energy resources " , schröder said in a statement issued by his office . ahead of his arrival in berlin , adamkus this week complained that " germany , a member of the european union , reached and signed an agreement with russia without informing poland and lithuania . " brazauskas echoed the sentiment in an interview with germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .
" during the preparation of the project nobody asked our opinion even once .
everything was done behind our backs , " he said .
" i do n't know who is trying to play around with us , russia , or maybe germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern european countries want a land route eastern european critics say it would make more sense to modernize and extend the two existing pipelines which already run through the three traditional transit countries .
poland , ukraine and the baltic states have also proposed an alternative land route .
the " bernstein pipeline " would pass run from russia to poland , passing through latvia and lithuania . brazauskas has also warned of the dangers of an underwater project , which he says risks disturbing tons of chemical weapons sunk in the baltic sea by the russians following world war ii . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

in the past month , he had drawn the wrath of bundesliga managers over a number of points including his continuing presence in california for long periods of time , the ongoing goalkeeper duel between oliver kahn and jens lehmann , and the intensive physical fitness program he and his assistant joachim löw have introduced . when all was said and done , the two sides , who had at times in the past two weeks used the mass media to launch volleys at the other , left the summit as " friends and not as parties with differences , " according to bayern munich 's chief director karl-heinz rummenigge . task force revival in an effort to improve communications between the two sides , which as could be seen in newspaper articles was anything but optimal , the task force has been reconvened to support klinsmann .
before the euro 2000 , a similar commission was established . seven people will head up the force whose spokesman will be none other than the outspoken hoeness .
also joining the group will be uli 's brother , dieter hoeness from hertha berlin and representatives from schalke , stuttgart , bremen and dortmund in addition to the league 's president werner hackmann . in addressing the criticisms that the league 's managers have been leveling at klinsmann , compromises were found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately a third man is between goalkeeping rivals jens lehmann -lrb- l -rrb- and oliver kahn " i 'll be present -lrb- in germany -rrb- when it 's important to move things ahead , " was his answer to his absence from the company .
nevertheless , when those " things " will happen remains unclear and he said he will come when necessary . as for the fitness program that he has brought partially from his long stay in the usa , when and how tests will be held would be better communicated . finally , as for the goalie debate that many say is preventing the formation of a cohesive unit , nothing has changed .
the rotation between kahn and lehmann will continue . and so little may have changed in reality but league reps and the coaching staff around jürgen klinsmann had the opportunity to get some things off their chest . in the typical , optimistic style of klinsmann he wrapped things up by saying that the team would have to find the " motivation and euphoria that we had before the confederations cup .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faust 's 1971 debut lp sold badly but secured a cult following equally significant during this time was what krautrock did n't draw from , namely the blues-rock purism purported by the likes of eric clapton 's cream or the rolling stones . " there were so many reasons to be different , " said michael rother of neu !
" we did n't discuss ' theories , ' we just got together and started playing and it happened .
we all knew about the velvet underground but somehow ended up with different structures . " foreshadow of things to come talking to the legendary music critic and writer lester bangs in 1975 , kraftwerk 's ralf hütter offered this explanation : " we were very lucky .
at the time there were electronic music concerts , happenings , the fluxus group , etc .
it was very normal ; we played on the same circuit , the galleries .
when we began we did n't have any engagements in the traditional music world , we were engaged in the artistic world , galleries , universities . " but it would be a mistake to characterize krautrock as so far out that it did n't make an impression on mainstream pop music . while the post-1960s music world was becoming ever more decadent , the germans moved in the opposite direction , becoming more stripped down , more inward .
holger czukay 's so-called " minimal-is-maximal " credo , which he pioneered in can , would soon become the status quo for much of the punk , post-punk and new-wave era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk 's 1978 album " man machine " impacted what would become synth pop and techno can , faust , neu ! and tangerine dream , which sold well in europe , cultivated a devoted circle of fans including other hip art-rockers such as david bowie , brian eno , iggy pop and negativeland .
likewise , a group of classical music students from düsseldorf known as kraftwerk -lrb- german for ' power plant ' -rrb- were bringing new visual art concepts to their music while at the same time tinkering with electronics , altering their moog synthesizers and building their own drum machines . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

german officials have since said that they are almost certain the birds died from poison and carried a harmless flu virus . concern was also raised by the discovery of a lethal strain of bird flu in a parrot that died while in quarantine in britain last week . the eu import ban was agreed in brussels by veterinary experts from the eu 's 25 member states , based on proposals drawn up urgently by the european commission following the british case . " these measures ... aim to strengthen further the eu 's defenses against avian influenza , " said the commission in a statement . commercial , private birds ha n dled differe n tly the new ban covers captive live birds other than poultry imported for commercial purposes , while separate measures were agreed for private imports of pet birds , the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 virus under the microscope the eu has bolstered its defenses against bird flu after the h5n1 lethal strain of the virus , which has killed over 60 people in asia since 2003 , was found in turkey and romania . the sense of urgency was heightened further when british authorities confirmed at the end of last week that a parrot which died while in quarantine was infected with the deadly asian strain . croatia n poultry ba n n ed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swans in croatia were infected with h5n1 in a separate measure to stop the disease spreading the eu commission earlier tuesday confirmed an eu ban on live poultry imports from croatia , after a second outbreak was detected there this week .
on wednesday , eu officials confirmed that animals in the balkan country had been infected with the h5n1 virus . the global ban on pet bird imports , confirmed late tuesday by the eu 's standing committee on the food chain and animal health , will come into force as soon as formally approved by the eu commission in the next few days . health certificates n eeded under the commission 's proposal , individuals could only import five birds as pets and would have to provide certificates proving that the birds were not infected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a vaccine can only be developed after an outbreak " we feel that the main risk is through commercial imports , which are large scale imports , " commission spokesman philip tod said . about 232,000 pet and exotic birds have been imported into the eu over the past three months . health experts fear that a lethal strain of bird flu may at some stage jump the species barrier in europe and mix with normal influenza genes to create a pandemic that would be difficult to control . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dead birds raise virus scare in germany the discovery of more than 20 dead birds at a pond in western germany has raised fears that avian flu may have already found its way into the country , though officials are urging the public to remain calm .

an ocean pipeline would bypass the three transit countries by pumping gas directly from russia to germany via the baltic sea , thus robbing them of transfer costs . adamkus and the lithuanian prime minister algirdas brazaukas have both voiced their opposition to the pipeline , which is scheduled for completion by 2010 .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neu ! - minimalist icons in a wilderness of psychedelia art in postwar germany to put a finger on the pulse of this musical zeitgeist , one has to imagine growing up in a postwar germany that was literally rebuilding itself from the ground up .
despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can was one of the 1970s ' primary avant-garde rock groups musical ground zero tweaking the anglo-american legacy , the german bands added a vital distance . by viewing rock ' n ' roll as a foreign import , they were able to make it even more unique .
they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faust 's 1971 debut lp sold badly but secured a cult following equally significant during this time was what krautrock did n't draw from , namely the blues-rock purism purported by the likes of eric clapton 's cream or the rolling stones . " there were so many reasons to be different , " said michael rother of neu !
" we did n't discuss ' theories , ' we just got together and started playing and it happened .
we all knew about the velvet underground but somehow ended up with different structures . " foreshadow of things to come talking to the legendary music critic and writer lester bangs in 1975 , kraftwerk 's ralf hütter offered this explanation : " we were very lucky .
at the time there were electronic music concerts , happenings , the fluxus group , etc .
it was very normal ; we played on the same circuit , the galleries .
when we began we did n't have any engagements in the traditional music world , we were engaged in the artistic world , galleries , universities . " but it would be a mistake to characterize krautrock as so far out that it did n't make an impression on mainstream pop music . while the post-1960s music world was becoming ever more decadent , the germans moved in the opposite direction , becoming more stripped down , more inward .
holger czukay 's so-called " minimal-is-maximal " credo , which he pioneered in can , would soon become the status quo for much of the punk , post-punk and new-wave era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraftwerk 's 1978 album " man machine " impacted what would become synth pop and techno can , faust , neu ! and tangerine dream , which sold well in europe , cultivated a devoted circle of fans including other hip art-rockers such as david bowie , brian eno , iggy pop and negativeland .
likewise , a group of classical music students from düsseldorf known as kraftwerk -lrb- german for ' power plant ' -rrb- were bringing new visual art concepts to their music while at the same time tinkering with electronics , altering their moog synthesizers and building their own drum machines . adam allington send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany sheds the spirit of ' 68 with the country turning away from the red-green government and poised for a new political departure , dw-world spoke to green party politician hans-christian ströbele about the legacy of the late ' 60s .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .

despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .
" and for 20 years , we had got rid of culture .
it was n't just towns that were bombed ; culture was bombed too , and you ca n't rebuild culture . "

they infused it with a german character that 's instantly audible yet hard to categorize .
a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .

" there were so many reasons to be different , " said michael rother of neu !
" we did n't discuss ' theories , ' we just got together and started playing and it happened .
we all knew about the velvet underground but somehow ended up with different structures . " foreshadow of things to come talking to the legendary music critic and writer lester bangs in 1975 , kraftwerk 's ralf hütter offered this explanation : " we were very lucky .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

spd struggles to find new blood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd needs an infusion of fresh blood , say younger members german political parties are finding it increasingly hard to get young people to join their ranks and perhaps even become tomorrow 's party leaders .
for the social democrats , it 's proving especially challenging . the leadership of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- is not quite a council of octogenarians , but then again , the faces at the top are not exactly pink with the flush of youth . party chief franz müntefering is 65 ; outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder is 61 ; outgoing interior minister otto schily is 73 ; and economic development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul has celebrated her 62nd birthday .
while these might come in at the upper end of the age scale , it can be hard to find high-profile spd politicians under 50 . " the party is ailing a little when it comes to the next generation , " said oskar niedermeyer , a political science professor who researches political parties at berlin 's free university .
" personnel is relatively thin on the ground when it comes to new blood . " that has some , especially those within the party , worried about the spd 's future .
with the departure of gerhard schröder the party is losing one of its most charismatic figures .
he was 54 when he became chancellor in 1998 and he attracted younger voters in part exactly because his image was a relatively youthful one , especially compared to that of his opponent , chancellor helmut kohl , then aged 68 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old guard : -lrb- from left -rrb- müntefering , schily , joschka fischer and gerhard schröder " we run the danger that the spd is going to become a party of old people , " said björn böhning , the chair of the spd 's youth wing , the jusos .
" we know that young people are attracted to us and support us right now , but if nothing is done -lrb- to give the party a younger face -rrb- , that will stop . " generational change he is demanding that the party work harder to support its younger members , putting more of them in high-profile , responsible positions with the aim of keeping the party from becoming stale . " the new cabinet is a good beginning , " he said , referring to the future cabinet in an angela merkel-led grand coalition government between the spd and the conservative christian union bloc .
there will be eight spd ministers , three of whom are under 50 .
" but there must be a much stronger generational change in the party and the parliamentary group . " but the question is who those new faces will be and even whether the spd has enough young people in the ranks who have the potential to be future leaders of the party , and by extension , perhaps the country . brandt era political scientists trace the low reserves in the party to the era of willy brandt , the legendary spd figure who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974 .
during this time , the party experienced an explosion of growth , and many of the new members were in their late teens or early 20s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young gerhard schröder with willy brandt in 1980 these so-called " brandt 's grandchildren , " and there were many of them , became the party leaders of the next generation , and are still there today .
their numbers left little room , and few leading positions , for younger people , who were often seen as competitors and pushed down when they showed too much ambition . that has led to some frustration among younger party members . " the same people have the power positions in the party for 20 years , " said werner patzelt , a political science professor at dresden 's technical university .
" young spd members want the same chances the schröders in the party had . " enough waiting in the wings ? sometimes , however , the younger people are simply not there .
when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

when the green party formed and began to coalesce as a small , but serious political party , many young , left-leaning spd members decided to jump ship and join the new guys on the block . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , up-and-coming spd youngster that is not to say that there are no younger spd politicians waiting in the wings .
andrea nahles -lrb- photo -rrb- , 35 , is being considered for the job of deputy parliamentary group leader , among other high-level jobs .
sigmar gabriel , 46 , has been named environment minister in the new merkel cabinet .
although klaus wowereit , current mayor of berlin , is already 53 , he still counts as a younger spd politician with a potentially bright future .
-lrb- most would say he acts much younger than his years , anyway . -rrb- " i 'm sometimes skeptical when people want new , younger faces just to have new faces , " said patzelt .
" you need people who have the experience needed in these high positions so they can hold their own against their opponents .
it 's important to have a balance between younger and older . " he also warns that the generational change brings other dangers with it , especially for the spd .
the jusos , and younger members of the party in general , tend to be more left-wing than the older , more experienced politicians .
as younger people try to get more power , it could lead to a schism between the young , who want to maintain germany 's generous welfare state and emphasize social justice , and those older members , who support gerhard schröder 's more centrist agenda 2010 , the controversial spate of welfare and labor reforms aimed at making germany more competitive on the world stage . experts are quick to point out that the problem of fresh blood is a problem for all germany 's political parties , although the spd has been hit perhaps the hardest .
according to patzelt , younger people in general are not as interested anymore in the traditional path of joining a political party and moving up in the ranks by proving their loyalty .
" people still want to participate , but are looking at things like citizens ' initiatives , more short-term commitments , " he said .
" besides , demographics show our society is getting older .
there are simply fewer young people to go around .

less then two weeks after the less than spectacular displays against turkey and china they demanded a meeting with germany 's national soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann to clear some things up about just how team germany should be run . on tuesday , klinsmann , who by no means was avoiding the rendezvous with the likes of bayern munich 's uli hoeness , met representatives from the league and the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- to discuss just how the success of germany can best be guaranteed at next summer 's world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness has been one of the loudest critics of klinsmann after a round of talks in frankfurt that lasted two and a half hours , klinsmann called the discussion " lively and good . "
in the past month , he had drawn the wrath of bundesliga managers over a number of points including his continuing presence in california for long periods of time , the ongoing goalkeeper duel between oliver kahn and jens lehmann , and the intensive physical fitness program he and his assistant joachim löw have introduced . when all was said and done , the two sides , who had at times in the past two weeks used the mass media to launch volleys at the other , left the summit as " friends and not as parties with differences , " according to bayern munich 's chief director karl-heinz rummenigge . task force revival in an effort to improve communications between the two sides , which as could be seen in newspaper articles was anything but optimal , the task force has been reconvened to support klinsmann .
before the euro 2000 , a similar commission was established . seven people will head up the force whose spokesman will be none other than the outspoken hoeness .
also joining the group will be uli 's brother , dieter hoeness from hertha berlin and representatives from schalke , stuttgart , bremen and dortmund in addition to the league 's president werner hackmann . in addressing the criticisms that the league 's managers have been leveling at klinsmann , compromises were found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortunately a third man is between goalkeeping rivals jens lehmann -lrb- l -rrb- and oliver kahn " i 'll be present -lrb- in germany -rrb- when it 's important to move things ahead , " was his answer to his absence from the company .
nevertheless , when those " things " will happen remains unclear and he said he will come when necessary . as for the fitness program that he has brought partially from his long stay in the usa , when and how tests will be held would be better communicated . finally , as for the goalie debate that many say is preventing the formation of a cohesive unit , nothing has changed .
the rotation between kahn and lehmann will continue . and so little may have changed in reality but league reps and the coaching staff around jürgen klinsmann had the opportunity to get some things off their chest . in the typical , optimistic style of klinsmann he wrapped things up by saying that the team would have to find the " motivation and euphoria that we had before the confederations cup .

an ocean pipeline would bypass the three transit countries by pumping gas directly from russia to germany via the baltic sea , thus robbing them of transfer costs . adamkus and the lithuanian prime minister algirdas brazaukas have both voiced their opposition to the pipeline , which is scheduled for completion by 2010 .

" brazauskas echoed the sentiment in an interview with germany 's mass-circulation bild newspaper .

the " bernstein pipeline " would pass run from russia to poland , passing through latvia and lithuania . brazauskas has also warned of the dangers of an underwater project , which he says risks disturbing tons of chemical weapons sunk in the baltic sea by the russians following world war ii . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy key as eu and russia meet the leaders of russia and the european union are meeting in london this week for a summit held against the background of deepening dependence on russian gas and oil in the energy-hungry eu bloc .

" february 13 , 1945 was a day that reminded me of pre-spring .
i still remember every detail .
my family and i were sitting at the table and were listening to the radio program .
that evening the rundfunk transmitted a program that created a rather happy atmosphere when suddenly during a song named ' on the wings of colored dreams ' we heard the sirens . "
bombs were falling all around ilse walter and her family .
in the inferno of dresden tens of thousands of people fell victim to the allied bombing raid .
some 15 square kilometers of the historical city center were turned into nothing but a gigantic heap of debris .
the former palace , the zwinger , the semper opera , the arts gallery and the theatre were reduced to smoking ruins .
even the monumental frauenkirche , whose impressive dome towered above the silhouette of the city , was leveled in the bombing .
destroying history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us planes drop bombs near dresden on feb .
6 , 1945 dresden 's famous church with its often admired sandstone roofed dome had stood proudly in the city center for 200 years , but when allied planes dropped their bombs in one of the most severe attacks in world war ii , it was hollowed out .
after the air raid , there was hope the frauenkirche had survived , but on february 15 , 1945 at 10:00 a.m. the church eventually collapsed .
up to this point the city of dresden had only experienced the horrors of war through stories told by frontier soldiers or reports of eastern europe refugees , who thought they were safe in dresden .
ilse walter recalls the last days before the dresden bombing : " it was reported that bombing squads were approaching hannover / braunschweig .
yes , hannover / braunschweig , we were used to hearing this every day .
for us in dresden these cities were far , far away . "
senseless bombing from a military point of view the bombing of dresden was completely senseless .
the plan of splitting germany had been finished long before .
the protocol of london had already set the borderlines of the occupation zones in autumn 1944 and the end of the war was obvious for everyone , even though berlin still professed otherwise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolished dresden after the air raids on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 dresden was not a garrison city and its industry was located far away from the city 's core .
still today there is a question mark over the motives for the destruction of one of europe 's sites of cultural heritage .
many speculations and rumors concerning the attack existed and still exist today .

" february 13 , 1945 was a day that reminded me of pre-spring .
i still remember every detail .
my family and i were sitting at the table and were listening to the radio program .
that evening the rundfunk transmitted a program that created a rather happy atmosphere when suddenly during a song named ' on the wings of colored dreams ' we heard the sirens . "
bombs were falling all around ilse walter and her family .
in the inferno of dresden tens of thousands of people fell victim to the allied bombing raid .
some 15 square kilometers of the historical city center were turned into nothing but a gigantic heap of debris .
the former palace , the zwinger , the semper opera , the arts gallery and the theatre were reduced to smoking ruins .
even the monumental frauenkirche , whose impressive dome towered above the silhouette of the city , was leveled in the bombing .
destroying history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us planes drop bombs near dresden on feb .
6 , 1945 dresden 's famous church with its often admired sandstone roofed dome had stood proudly in the city center for 200 years , but when allied planes dropped their bombs in one of the most severe attacks in world war ii , it was hollowed out .
after the air raid , there was hope the frauenkirche had survived , but on february 15 , 1945 at 10:00 a.m. the church eventually collapsed .
up to this point the city of dresden had only experienced the horrors of war through stories told by frontier soldiers or reports of eastern europe refugees , who thought they were safe in dresden .
ilse walter recalls the last days before the dresden bombing : " it was reported that bombing squads were approaching hannover / braunschweig .
yes , hannover / braunschweig , we were used to hearing this every day .
for us in dresden these cities were far , far away . "
senseless bombing from a military point of view the bombing of dresden was completely senseless .
the plan of splitting germany had been finished long before .
the protocol of london had already set the borderlines of the occupation zones in autumn 1944 and the end of the war was obvious for everyone , even though berlin still professed otherwise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demolished dresden after the air raids on feb .
13 and 14 , 1945 dresden was not a garrison city and its industry was located far away from the city 's core .
still today there is a question mark over the motives for the destruction of one of europe 's sites of cultural heritage .
many speculations and rumors concerning the attack existed and still exist today .
winston churchill said at the time : " it seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of german cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror , should be reviewed .
otherwise we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land .
i feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives ... rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction . "
rebuilding dresden the socialist way after the war in 1945 east german leader walter ulbricht dreamed of a socialist dresden with wide boulevards and large squares for state functions .
however , art historians , city planners and protectors of dresden 's historical architecture fought for a thorough reconstruction of the baroque city .
their dream began to materialize on aug .
9 , 1945 when renovation work began on the zwinger palace and theater .
the frauenkirche , however , did not enjoy the same fate .
a symbol of destruction and rebirth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dome of the frauenkirche in dresden unlike many other churches in the german democratic republic which were demolished during the 40 years of communist rule , the thirteen-meter high skeleton of the frauenkirche was preserved as a reminder of war 's destruction .
after the fall of the wall in 1990 a foundation was established to gather money for the reconstruction of dresden 's famous church .
since then , vast sums of money have poured in from across germany and around the world , and the church has slowly , piece by piece , been rebuilt .

" krautrock , " originally coined as a somewhat derogatory term by the british music press , was a label pinned to legions of west german bands that sprang up in the late 1960s and 70s . these groups , most of whom were radically different from their uk and us contemporaries , experimented with a variety of sounds , often incorporating primitive synthesizers , electric guitars , driving drum beats and pre-recorded audiotape to create droning , sonic soundscapes . similar to the british invasion groups who took a uniquely american form and reinvented it for themselves , krautrock encompassed not only the whole canon of rock and jazz but also visual art ideas about structure and composition as well as a uniquely german postwar ' everything is new ' sense of urgency . it 's difficult to pick a handful of representatives out of a genre that was by its very nature composed of experimentalists and outsiders .
but a good place to start would be the highly influential triumvirate of can , faust and neu ! , followed closely by the likes of kraftwerk , tangerine dream , harmonia , guru guru , amon duul , la düsseldorf and cluster to name a few .

despite the undercurrents of political unrest , the gaiety of the hippie era in much of the western world was a guilt-free indulgence in a wealth of new possibilities . while german youth of the same era shared similar hopes and desires , there were other , much darker influences on their world view . " all the young revolutionaries of 1968 had parents who were either nazis or had suffered under the nazis , and the relationship of the parents to the nazis , and of their children to them , was a special german thing and had a big influence on the 1968 troubles , " explained can 's irmin schmidt .

a combination of dada , lsd and cold-war politics resulted in a dry , absurdist humor that could range from zany to nonchalant . " the single unifying factor i see in most of these bands is that they - we - wanted to get away from traditional ways of making music , that we were looking for a new form ... like the students in and after 1968 were looking for new forms to live and organize society and politics , " said jochen irmler , who played keyboards in faust .

some 15 square kilometers of the historical city center were turned into nothing but a gigantic heap of debris .
the former palace , the zwinger , the semper opera , the arts gallery and the theatre were reduced to smoking ruins .
even the monumental frauenkirche , whose impressive dome towered above the silhouette of the city , was leveled in the bombing .
destroying history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us planes drop bombs near dresden on feb .
6 , 1945 dresden 's famous church with its often admired sandstone roofed dome had stood proudly in the city center for 200 years , but when allied planes dropped their bombs in one of the most severe attacks in world war ii , it was hollowed out .
after the air raid , there was hope the frauenkirche had survived , but on february 15 , 1945 at 10:00 a.m. the church eventually collapsed .
up to this point the city of dresden had only experienced the horrors of war through stories told by frontier soldiers or reports of eastern europe refugees , who thought they were safe in dresden .
ilse walter recalls the last days before the dresden bombing : " it was reported that bombing squads were approaching hannover / braunschweig .
yes , hannover / braunschweig , we were used to hearing this every day .
for us in dresden these cities were far , far away . "
senseless bombing from a military point of view the bombing of dresden was completely senseless .
the plan of splitting germany had been finished long before .
the protocol of london had already set the borderlines of the occupation zones in autumn 1944 and the end of the war was obvious for everyone , even though berlin still professed otherwise .

13 and 14 , 1945 dresden was not a garrison city and its industry was located far away from the city 's core .
still today there is a question mark over the motives for the destruction of one of europe 's sites of cultural heritage .
many speculations and rumors concerning the attack existed and still exist today .
winston churchill said at the time : " it seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of german cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror , should be reviewed .
otherwise we shall come into control of an utterly ruined land .
i feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives ... rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction . "
rebuilding dresden the socialist way after the war in 1945 east german leader walter ulbricht dreamed of a socialist dresden with wide boulevards and large squares for state functions .
however , art historians , city planners and protectors of dresden 's historical architecture fought for a thorough reconstruction of the baroque city .
their dream began to materialize on aug .
9 , 1945 when renovation work began on the zwinger palace and theater .
the frauenkirche , however , did not enjoy the same fate .
a symbol of destruction and rebirth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dome of the frauenkirche in dresden unlike many other churches in the german democratic republic which were demolished during the 40 years of communist rule , the thirteen-meter high skeleton of the frauenkirche was preserved as a reminder of war 's destruction .
after the fall of the wall in 1990 a foundation was established to gather money for the reconstruction of dresden 's famous church .
since then , vast sums of money have poured in from across germany and around the world , and the church has slowly , piece by piece , been rebuilt .
on feb .
13 , 2006 , 61 years after ilse walter witnessed the destruction of the city 's emblem right in front of her eyes , the frauenkirche will once again dominate dresden 's historic sky line . gerda gericke -lrb- lucas -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : dresden - a city risen from the ashes looking back on dresden 's historical development , it is remarkable that the city has recovered and developed into a thriving metropolis in the economically deprived region of eastern germany .

the firm 's chief executive , lee scott , told analysts that the rate - stuck at $ 5.15 for almost a decade - was " out of date with the times " .
customers were struggling to make ends meet , so a rising minimum wage would be good for business , he said .
but he resisted calls for wal-mart to raise its own wages .
at the same time , mr scott called for the firm to become more energy-efficient .
it would aim for a 30 % cut in energy use at stores and better fuel efficiency in its delivery fleet .
profit problems we can see first-hand at wal-mart how many of our customers are struggling to get by lee scott , wal-mart chief executive mr scott , speaking a week after the us senate voted down a minimum wage rise to $ 6.25 , said he normally would not take a position in public on this kind of issue .
but he said the hard-pressed status of many of his firm 's customers changed the rules .
" we simply believe it is time for congress to take a responsible look at the minimum wage and other legislation that may help working families , " he said .
" we can see first-hand at wal-mart how many of our customers are struggling to get by . "
despite his call for a general rise in wages , mr scott said the firm would not be raising its own pay rates for " associates " , as it calls its shopfloor staff , saying it would hammer the firm 's $ 10bn a year profits .
wal-mart pays an average of $ 9.37 an hour .
" we almost always pay better " than competing firms , he said , both to analysts and in a speech to staff .
" but that is often overlooked or ignored in the public debate about wal-mart . "
still , the group - the biggest retailer in the world - acknowledged that healthcare in particular was a burden for its employees , promising to introduce a cheaper healthcare package .

the firm 's chief executive , lee scott , told analysts that the rate - stuck at $ 5.15 for almost a decade - was " out of date with the times " .
customers were struggling to make ends meet , so a rising minimum wage would be good for business , he said .
but he resisted calls for wal-mart to raise its own wages .

it would aim for a 30 % cut in energy use at stores and better fuel efficiency in its delivery fleet .

supporters of prestatyn 's scala cinema hope it will be returned to its former glory after it closed in 2000 .
their long-running campaign has been boosted by a £ 1.5m grant by the welsh assembly government .
supporter sandra pitt wants to see the cinema , which was originally built as a town hall in 1898 , showing films again within two years .
it was such a loss in the town and it was really missed .
sandra pitt , campaigner mrs pitt said : " it 's wonderful news .
it 's been a hard slog and we 've been fighting for this for five years .
" it will be a mega party on the day that it opens again - the town needs it .
" it was just the hub of the community - if you were meeting someone you met outside the scala . "
mrs pitt , chair of the friends of scala , said she hoped it would still be a friendly place .
grants breakdown £ 1.6m - pembrokeshire , national park conservation and haverfordwest town centre improvements £ 1.5m - blaenavon , town centre open spaces £ 1.5 - prestatyn , scala cinema / arts project £ 1.3m - llanelli , bridge st pedestrianisation £ 1.1m - bridgend , market st and betws improvements £ 1.1m - flintshire cycling / pedestrian scheme at castle park industrial estate £ 1m - aberavon carpark renovation £ 1m - barry town centre improvements £ 1m - newport , industrial estates access £ 950,000 - gwynedd council community projects £ 526,000 - wrexham , gwersyllt community resource centre £ 241,000 - llangefni , road , transport improvements £ 220,000 - abertillery , new car park " it was such a loss in the town and it was really missed , " she added .
the scala showed silent films before world war i but finally closed due to structural problems in december 2000 .
one of the first films to be shown at the scala was the epic of its time - all quiet on the western front .
the assembly government is offering denbighshire council the grant .
the total cost of the regeneration scheme is estimated to be around £ 3.5m but mrs pitt said the group is well on their way to achieving the target .
she added : " we hope denbighshire council will find some money and the friends need to raise around £ 100,000 . "
the plans include a twin-screen cinema , a cafe bar and space for theatre and dances .
the scala was converted into a cinema in 1913 by cinematography pioneer james roberts - who was known as saronie - and screened its first " talkie " in march 1930 .
the refurbishment will see london-based architects burrell foley fischer working on the designs .
the scala is one of 13 projects receiving a total of £ 13m from the physical regeneration fund .
other projects include money for bridgend council for traffic works and money to blaenau gwent to improve disabled facilities .

different instruments , rhythms and notes can be felt through five finger pads attached to the " vibrato " speaker .
brunel university design graduate shane kerwin is working on a prototype which he hopes will allow deaf children to join in mainstream music lessons .
if connected to a computer , the device allows deaf people to compose music .
mr kerwin said : " vibrato will mean deaf children can join in with music classes in a way that would previously have been impossible .
the lack of tactile sensation means deaf people can not easily perceive the sounds being produced paul whittaker music and the deaf " i hope that vibrato will help us to integrate deaf students into mainstream musical education and enable schools to encourage deaf children to take up music as much as hearing children . "
earlier this month , it was reported that scientists are developing a cochlear implant , which could allow deaf people to hear music as well as speech , by using a wider frequency range .
and there have been several " deaf raves " in london , with an emphasis on bass and heavy rhythmic tracks , allowing clubbers to feel the music through their bodies .
but the idea of hearing music through vibrations dates back much further .
ludwig van beethoven was completely deaf by 1818 , but continued to compose for another 10 years .
he is said to have cut the legs off his piano and played while sitting on the floor so he could feel the vibrations better .
paul whittaker , artistic director at the uk charity music and the deaf , said many deaf people were able to enjoy music - but much of the technology was not available to them .

an officer also told the jury he did not know if tape and lip gloss found at the scene three months after the attack had been there earlier .
mr falconio , 28 , disappeared after an ambush in the outback on 14 july 2001 .
bradley murdoch , 47 , denies murdering him and attacking and abducting his girlfriend joanne lees .
the court heard how the couple 's camper van , found in scrub close to the scene on the remote stuart highway , north of alice springs , was not tested for gunshot powder until two weeks later on 1 august 2001 . "
when on the back of the truck , the wind , it 's going to blow that residue off " senior constable ian spilsbury by then it had been driven on a truck to a police garage in alice springs where it was dusted for fingerprints before being checked for gunshot powder .
investigating officer , senior constable ian spilsbury , told the jury : " with residue from a gunshot , if it lands on a surface , in the fingerprint process you 're dusting and you are going to be dusting residue off .
" when on the back of the truck , the wind , it 's going to blow that residue off . "
mr spilsbury told the jury he did not know whether black tape and a lip balm tube found at the scene three months after the attack was there days after the alleged ambush .
initially police only found the lip balm lid miss lees said she had used to loosen handcuffs with which mr murdoch had allegedly restrained her .
they did not search the nearby area until three months later , he said .
a photograph on 16 july 2001 showed a barren area underneath the bush and the lip balm lid .
but photographs on 15 october showed the area with more " leaf litter " , tape pieces and the lip balm tube .
asked by grant algie , for the defence , if someone had put the lip balm and tape there before he photographed it , he replied : " no .
i was called over to the area , shown the tape , and then i found the lip balm . "
questioned whether or not he would have seen the tape and lip balm when he took photographs that july , he said he did not know .
he said he thought other officers had looked under the tree and they thought he would search the area in the days after the attack . "
in hindsight we probably should have gone over it , but we did not " senior constable ian spilsbury he told the court the police had revisited the scene north of barrow creek on 15 october with new recruits .
he showed the new officers to the tree where the lip balm lid was found and an officer saw two pieces of black duct tape .
miss lees said she had bitten the tape off her handcuffs while hiding in the bush .
after taking photographs , mr spilsbury found the red lip balm tube .
asked why he did not search the scene further on 16 july , he said : " i can only put it down to we thought they -lrb- other officers -rrb- had already been there and that was all they had located .
" in hindsight we probably should have gone over it , but we did not . "
the court heard aboriginal trackers visited the scene in july but were only there for a short time .
the judge accepted an apology from newspapers who had claimed the main prosecutor had referred to him by his first name .

however , for some the dream of a job and a better way of life is not realised , with many finding themselves living destitute on the streets .
migrants from countries within the eu are legally entitled to come to the uk in search of work , but for their first year in the country they are not eligible for any housing or welfare benefits .
they are also not allowed to stay in statutory shelters for the homeless .
consequently when their work dries up , so does their money and they are left living in a foreign country without any safety net .
this is the situation eddie and sergei find themselves in , with both men now living rough on the streets of belfast .
eddie came to northern ireland from lithuania when the country was accepted into the eu in november 2004 .
when he arrived in northern ireland , he secured a job working as a fisherman in kilkeel , but when this job ended six months ago he found himself out of work and homeless .
sergei , from latvia , came to work as a labourer in dublin , but arrived in belfast six months ago looking for work after his job in the irish republic ended .
the two men used to live under this motorway bridge since losing their jobs , both men have lived rough at various locations across the city , including under a motorway bridge and bushes close to the river lagan .
however , after being attacked by a group of youths , the pair had to find an alternative place to stay .
" one night , six , maybe seven young people , absolutely drunk , maybe narcotics , -lrb- threw -rrb- stones .
for me and sergei , very dangerous , " eddie said .
now home for both men is a scrap car , where they are allowed to stay with the permission of the owner .
both men visit a drop-in centre for the homeless in west belfast , where they are able to get their clothes washed and eat their only guaranteed warm meal of the day .
while such a life may seem intolerable , both men say they would rather stay in northern ireland than return to their homelands .
" we like your country , we like staying here .
find work , pay tax , " eddie said .
maurice rooney from the housing executive said sergei and eddie 's case highlighted the difficulties faced by people coming to northern ireland to work .
" the government has placed restrictions on such citizens ' entitlement to assistance from the state here , " he said .
" in a sense they would need to be working in order to be able to access benefits , including housing from the housing executive . "
however , he said the housing executive was working with voluntary organisations in an attempt to provide people in such circumstances with temporary accommodation .

okinawans have long complained about the impact of the us bases the rape of an okinawan schoolgirl by three us servicemen in futenma air base in 1995 caused an outcry on the island , and tokyo and washington agreed that futenma 's facilities , currently in a densely populated residential area , would be moved elsewhere .
such are the sensitivities of the us base issue in okinawa , however , that the two sides have taken 10 years to come to a decision on a new location .
a planned visit to okinawa by us president george w bush in mid-november appears to have concentrated minds , and both sides said on wednesday that agreement had now been reached .
the two options that appeared to dominate discussions were both controversial .
the us government wanted to build a new base on a coral reef close to henoko , in nago prefecture .
but the plan generated strong protests from okinawans who are concerned that the local environment , home to the rare dugong sea creature , would be ruined .
so the japanese government suggested an alternative - to use part of the existing us base at camp schwab , and build a smaller facility off henoko .
the pentagon did not like this idea initially , however , saying it would disrupt training at camp schwab , according to japanese media reports .
but following wednesday 's announcement , the us appears to have settled for the japanese option , though details remain sketchy .
seeds of discontent there is a long history of opposition to us forces within okinawa .
some residents feel that it is unfair that a string of tiny islands which account for only 0.6 % of japan 's landmass are host to 66 % of the us military personnel in the country .
but others point out that they are a valuable source of income in one of japan 's poorest provinces .
there are regular protests whenever a crime is committed by the us forces in okinawa , and about the noise and pollution their activities generate .
but the public protests over henoko have been remarkable both for their duration , the attention they have generated in the rest of japan , and the affect this has apparently had on the japanese government .
protesters have physically got in the way of work at henoko at first glance , the agreement is a coup for these protesters , who have spent the last eight years pressing for the us plan to be dropped .
kenichi moriyama , 63 , spent more than a year - first sitting in a tent on the shore , and then out at sea - seeking to prevent the authorities from carrying out a preparatory survey in the area .
" the contractors of this project , with the defence facility agency officers , came to henoko to start a drilling survey .
they said that is needed prior to the construction .
we stopped them , " mr moriyama said simply .
the protesters , whom mr moriyama said have numbered more than 40,000 from all over japan , used various tactics - physically getting in the way of the contractors by sailing boats in front of the drilling platforms or climbing onto the platforms themselves .
but when asked prior to wednesday 's announcement whether the japanese government 's plan for henoko was preferable , the protesters were doubtful .
" it 's a very silly plan .
eighty per cent of okinawan people are against new construction in henoko , " said suzuyo takazato , chair of okinawa women act against military violence .
" even the prefectural government is asking that the plan should be outside okinawa , " she said .
the dugong also known as sea cows , can grow to 3m in length inhabit shallow waters in indo-pacific ; feed on sea grass long life span and slow breeding rate mean susceptible to threats she added that the japanese government 's plan was easier to carry out , because the protesters would be unable to stake out camp schwab , where much of the new facilities would be constructed , and tokyo could argue that camp schwab was already established anyway .
ms takazato also said that there had been no " close analysis " of the new proposal .
" i do n't know how much noise would affect the environment .
japan government -lsb- decided on this plan -rsb- without any close and deep consultation with local people . "
the decision on futenma is not just important for okinawans .
it may also indicate the longer-term plans the pentagon has for its forces in japan .
protesters say henoko bay should not be ruined yasuhiro tanaka , at the international christian university in tokyo , believes that both the us and japanese governments ' long-term plan is for the burden of pacific defence to shift onto japan .
" for the next few years , perhaps up to 10 , 15 years , the us will keep its presence at the current level of deployment ; but in the long run - whenever washington thinks the japanese defence force is able to take over - the japanese will have a larger role in okinawa .
it remains to be seen whether okinawans would be much happier with this scenario .
having a domestic , rather than foreign , force in the prefecture would of course be less culturally sensitive , but factors such as noise and environmental impact might still be an issue .
mr moriyama said of the current impact of the bases : " the soil here is red .. and once it rains the red soil flows into the sea and the sea turns red because -lsb- the us forces -rsb- dispose of explosives in the mountains ...
we have suffered from the bases for 60 years already . "

do you think the decision will resolve the controversy ?

okinawans have long complained about the impact of the us bases the rape of an okinawan schoolgirl by three us servicemen in futenma air base in 1995 caused an outcry on the island , and tokyo and washington agreed that futenma 's facilities , currently in a densely populated residential area , would be moved elsewhere .
such are the sensitivities of the us base issue in okinawa , however , that the two sides have taken 10 years to come to a decision on a new location .
a planned visit to okinawa by us president george w bush in mid-november appears to have concentrated minds , and both sides said on wednesday that agreement had now been reached .
the two options that appeared to dominate discussions were both controversial .
the us government wanted to build a new base on a coral reef close to henoko , in nago prefecture .
but the plan generated strong protests from okinawans who are concerned that the local environment , home to the rare dugong sea creature , would be ruined .
so the japanese government suggested an alternative - to use part of the existing us base at camp schwab , and build a smaller facility off henoko .
the pentagon did not like this idea initially , however , saying it would disrupt training at camp schwab , according to japanese media reports .
but following wednesday 's announcement , the us appears to have settled for the japanese option , though details remain sketchy .
seeds of discontent there is a long history of opposition to us forces within okinawa .
some residents feel that it is unfair that a string of tiny islands which account for only 0.6 % of japan 's landmass are host to 66 % of the us military personnel in the country .
but others point out that they are a valuable source of income in one of japan 's poorest provinces .
there are regular protests whenever a crime is committed by the us forces in okinawa , and about the noise and pollution their activities generate .
but the public protests over henoko have been remarkable both for their duration , the attention they have generated in the rest of japan , and the affect this has apparently had on the japanese government .
protesters have physically got in the way of work at henoko at first glance , the agreement is a coup for these protesters , who have spent the last eight years pressing for the us plan to be dropped .
kenichi moriyama , 63 , spent more than a year - first sitting in a tent on the shore , and then out at sea - seeking to prevent the authorities from carrying out a preparatory survey in the area .
" the contractors of this project , with the defence facility agency officers , came to henoko to start a drilling survey .
they said that is needed prior to the construction .
we stopped them , " mr moriyama said simply .
the protesters , whom mr moriyama said have numbered more than 40,000 from all over japan , used various tactics - physically getting in the way of the contractors by sailing boats in front of the drilling platforms or climbing onto the platforms themselves .
but when asked prior to wednesday 's announcement whether the japanese government 's plan for henoko was preferable , the protesters were doubtful .
" it 's a very silly plan .
eighty per cent of okinawan people are against new construction in henoko , " said suzuyo takazato , chair of okinawa women act against military violence .
" even the prefectural government is asking that the plan should be outside okinawa , " she said .
the dugong also known as sea cows , can grow to 3m in length inhabit shallow waters in indo-pacific ; feed on sea grass long life span and slow breeding rate mean susceptible to threats she added that the japanese government 's plan was easier to carry out , because the protesters would be unable to stake out camp schwab , where much of the new facilities would be constructed , and tokyo could argue that camp schwab was already established anyway .
ms takazato also said that there had been no " close analysis " of the new proposal .
" i do n't know how much noise would affect the environment .
japan government -lsb- decided on this plan -rsb- without any close and deep consultation with local people . "
the decision on futenma is not just important for okinawans .
it may also indicate the longer-term plans the pentagon has for its forces in japan .
protesters say henoko bay should not be ruined yasuhiro tanaka , at the international christian university in tokyo , believes that both the us and japanese governments ' long-term plan is for the burden of pacific defence to shift onto japan .
" for the next few years , perhaps up to 10 , 15 years , the us will keep its presence at the current level of deployment ; but in the long run - whenever washington thinks the japanese defence force is able to take over - the japanese will have a larger role in okinawa .
it remains to be seen whether okinawans would be much happier with this scenario .
having a domestic , rather than foreign , force in the prefecture would of course be less culturally sensitive , but factors such as noise and environmental impact might still be an issue .
mr moriyama said of the current impact of the bases : " the soil here is red .. and once it rains the red soil flows into the sea and the sea turns red because -lsb- the us forces -rsb- dispose of explosives in the mountains ...
we have suffered from the bases for 60 years already . "

northumbria and durham forces have already given their support to a three-force merger with cleveland .
but cleveland police authority is calling for a new force covering its current area and southern durham .
cleveland police authority met on tuesday night to discuss the options for the future of the force .
authority chair councillor dave mcluckie said : " we have the opinion of more than 30 stakeholders in the cleveland and south durham area who are asking us categorically not to support a regional force .
we felt that a larger police force , staying local , giving local accountability was the way the people wanted us to go dave mcluckie , cleveland police authority " it is not our decision as such - it is after a huge raft of consultations that we 've taken the decision . "
the proposal would see the cleveland force increased by more than 1,000 officers and 1,000 staff - giving a total force in excess of 4,500 .
mr mcluckie said : " we felt that a larger police force , staying local , giving local accountability was the way the people wanted us to go , and during 30 meetings over the past 20 days that 's what we 've been told . "
however , durham 's chief constable , paul garvin , said this week : " as far as the people of county durham and darlington are concerned , the case for a single regional force is , i believe , overwhelming and irresistible . "
a final detailed assessment of the favoured proposal must be submitted to the government by 23 december .
