" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" in many countries , one can become a doctor , vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal .

the districts of garmisch-partenkirchen and kempten were the worst affected as volunteers and aid workers moved to secure dykes and inhabitants from low-lying areas prepared for evacuation .
rail services into and out of munich were crippled after key lines were closed owing to mudslides and high water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man transports sandbags on his tractor in garmisch-partenkirchen authorities said that the catastrophe was worse than the 1999 floods , deemed the worst in centuries at the time .
but they believed the worst was over as floodwaters crested tuesday afternoon in the bavarian alps .
officials warned of flood-spawned mudslides on steep alpine slopes as the waters headed northward to munich and the danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cantonal road is torn away next to the river emme in werthenstein , central switzerland .
mudslides have already completely isolated the town of balderschwang on the austrian border , which can only be reached by air .
crews worked to clear a path through the wall of mud , while in other locations across southern bavaria , hundreds of workers piled sandbags and helped with evacuation efforts .
no flood-related fatalities have been reported in germany but , in a dramatic rescue , a 19-year-old woman was plucked from her car by a truck driver after her vehicle was washed off the road .
death toll in neighboring countries also affected by the flood , however , the death toll has risen to six .

the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .

the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself . in 1993 , after almost 25 years as world bank regional director for west and east africa and latin america , peter eigen could simply not take it anymore .
the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .
after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .

eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .

the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .
after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .
the organization 's yearly index targets not only developmental countries , but major industrial nations as well .
germany ranked 15th out of 145 countries last year , two places above the us , and nine above japan .
bangladesh and haiti are on the bottom of the list . anti-corruption measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international 's global corruption report critics have said that the corruption barometer , based on opinion polls , is n't always a reliable reflection of what is really going on .
eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .
" corruption is the biggest cause of poverty in the world , of violence , of impoverishment and hopelessness in many societies , " he said .
" and that 's why we need to fight it together . " klaus ulrich -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .
so the message is clear then : " less money and less power to pensioners ! " ranty islam interviewed luke harding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .

unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .
so the message is clear then : " less money and less power to pensioners !

last year it posted a deficit of 3.7 percent .
the pact has thus been at the center of a row between germany and the eu commission for years .
the commission has accused germany of not doing enough to set its financial house in order and consolidate its policies . stability pact rewrite last year , the commission threatened to start disciplinary proceedings against the country , but the move was put on hold later . in recent months , germany along with france , another eu budgetary pact offender , has been at the forefront of a drive to water down the pact much to the anger of smaller eurozone members . in march this year , the efforts bore fruit after eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

with the general election coming up , dw-world talked to him about his views on the current situation in germany . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
ray furlong : on the one hand , germany is still a very wealthy and prosperous society .
the problem is that is has n't had any decent economic growth for far too long .
unemployment figures also have n't come down significantly .
in economic terms the east of the country is still very much a burden .
a lot of money has been put into big projects there with no lasting benefits .
generally there there 's a bad vibe in germany .
however , i think the comparison with 1970s britain that is occasionally drawn does not work .
germany 's economy has never been as bad and the trade unions never as strong as in the uk in those days .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
germany is not competitive enough due to structural problems .
the high cost of labor needs to be tackled .
flexibility is also very important .
instead of trade unions and employers negotiating the wages centrally they should be determined factory by factory .
i am not sure whether ultimately consumption needs to be boosted .
more importantly business confidence needs to be strengthened so as to encourage more investment in germany .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
no comment .
what do you like about germa n y ?
i like berlin .
it has the advantages of a village - it is very laid back - and combines them with the advantages of a big city .
i enjoy the great diversity of accents and local regions in the country .
it is fascinating to see how this variety plays out also in the political arena , for example in the constant debate on reform in the country but also the recent confrontations between bavaria and the east of germany .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
there are a couple of small things i find frustrating .
i recently moved house and i had to repaint the walls in my old place for the next person to move in .
why ? ?
and there are the amounts banks charge for the privilege of me having an account with them .
oh yes , and when i went to an italian restaurant the other day they would only accept cash .
it makes you wonder what century they live in .
but all in all nothing major , really . ranty islam interviewed ray furlong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete coverage of the upcoming election .
economy set to dominate german election now that it looks like elections will take place in september , political parties can get down to the fundamentals of their campaigns , which will be dominated by two themes : unemployment and deficits .

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .

the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .
so the message is clear then : " less money and less power to pensioners ! " ranty islam interviewed luke harding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe .
-lrb- aug .
6 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself . in 1993 , after almost 25 years as world bank regional director for west and east africa and latin america , peter eigen could simply not take it anymore .
the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .
after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .
the organization 's yearly index targets not only developmental countries , but major industrial nations as well .

eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .
" corruption is the biggest cause of poverty in the world , of violence , of impoverishment and hopelessness in many societies , " he said .

ray furlong : on the one hand , germany is still a very wealthy and prosperous society .
the problem is that is has n't had any decent economic growth for far too long .
unemployment figures also have n't come down significantly .
in economic terms the east of the country is still very much a burden .

germany 's economy has never been as bad and the trade unions never as strong as in the uk in those days .

germany is not competitive enough due to structural problems .
the high cost of labor needs to be tackled .
flexibility is also very important .
instead of trade unions and employers negotiating the wages centrally they should be determined factory by factory .

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" in many countries , one can become a doctor , vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal .

the districts of garmisch-partenkirchen and kempten were the worst affected as volunteers and aid workers moved to secure dykes and inhabitants from low-lying areas prepared for evacuation .
rail services into and out of munich were crippled after key lines were closed owing to mudslides and high water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man transports sandbags on his tractor in garmisch-partenkirchen authorities said that the catastrophe was worse than the 1999 floods , deemed the worst in centuries at the time .
but they believed the worst was over as floodwaters crested tuesday afternoon in the bavarian alps .
officials warned of flood-spawned mudslides on steep alpine slopes as the waters headed northward to munich and the danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cantonal road is torn away next to the river emme in werthenstein , central switzerland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 the end of east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final military parade of the german democratic republic fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war . sabine bergmann-pohl 's term in office as president of the east german parliament , and officially head of state , was short .
she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
like dozens before them , they received no punishment .
-lrb- nov .
11 , 2004 -rrb- the last day of the stasi fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police .

she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" in many countries , one can become a doctor , vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal .

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .
so the message is clear then : " less money and less power to pensioners !

she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .

in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .

the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .

" it 's great to win this race , " said leipheimer in bonn , where the nine-stage race concluded on tuesday .
" the race has matured , and it 's one of the best races in the world now . "
ullrich loses in the mountains leipheimer , who came in sixth in this year 's tour de france , won the tour 's fourth stage , the 2,670 meter rettenbachferner climb , effectively solidifying his lead over ullrich .
the rostock native , who was set on winning the tour in his home country , struggled against the american in the mountains , echoing similar lost battles against another american in the pyrenees and french alps .
" i would have liked to win - i was 31 seconds short in the end , and that 's a pity , " said ullrich .

i did n't expect to be on the podium as my illness handicapped me . "

" gerolsteiner was simply better prepared and overall very strong .
they apparently recovered from the tour de france better than we did , " said ullrich .

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .

the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself . in 1993 , after almost 25 years as world bank regional director for west and east africa and latin america , peter eigen could simply not take it anymore .
the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .
after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .
the organization 's yearly index targets not only developmental countries , but major industrial nations as well .

eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .

after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .
the organization 's yearly index targets not only developmental countries , but major industrial nations as well .
germany ranked 15th out of 145 countries last year , two places above the us , and nine above japan .
bangladesh and haiti are on the bottom of the list . anti-corruption measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international 's global corruption report critics have said that the corruption barometer , based on opinion polls , is n't always a reliable reflection of what is really going on .
eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .
" corruption is the biggest cause of poverty in the world , of violence , of impoverishment and hopelessness in many societies , " he said .
" and that 's why we need to fight it together . " klaus ulrich -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?
corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt .
-lrb- july 23 , 2005 -rrb- transparency needed to crush corruption in its 2005 global corruption report , transparency international reveals how corruption in the construction sector undermines economic development , and of the potential for crooked dealings in the reconstruction of iraq .
-lrb- march 16 , 2005 -rrb- german lawmakers uneasy about stricter anti-corruption laws as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the foreign media 's take on germany ray furlong yan li aktham suliman richard bernstein election 2005 -pipe- 23.08.2005 luke harding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany thinks it 's bangladesh " luke harding has been the berlin correspondent for british newspaper " the guardian " for two years .
he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .
so the message is clear then : " less money and less power to pensioners ! " ranty islam interviewed luke harding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe .
-lrb- aug .
6 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .
-lrb- aug .
15 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you agree with luke harding ?
please include your name and country of residence in any reply .

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .

the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .

animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .

the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 the end of east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final military parade of the german democratic republic fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war . sabine bergmann-pohl 's term in office as president of the east german parliament , and officially head of state , was short .
she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .

the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .

the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .

we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .

can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .

ray furlong : on the one hand , germany is still a very wealthy and prosperous society .
the problem is that is has n't had any decent economic growth for far too long .
unemployment figures also have n't come down significantly .
in economic terms the east of the country is still very much a burden .
a lot of money has been put into big projects there with no lasting benefits .

however , i think the comparison with 1970s britain that is occasionally drawn does not work .
germany 's economy has never been as bad and the trade unions never as strong as in the uk in those days .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
germany is not competitive enough due to structural problems .
the high cost of labor needs to be tackled .
flexibility is also very important .
instead of trade unions and employers negotiating the wages centrally they should be determined factory by factory .

with the general election coming up , dw-world talked to him about his views on the current situation in germany . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
ray furlong : on the one hand , germany is still a very wealthy and prosperous society .
the problem is that is has n't had any decent economic growth for far too long .
unemployment figures also have n't come down significantly .
in economic terms the east of the country is still very much a burden .
a lot of money has been put into big projects there with no lasting benefits .
generally there there 's a bad vibe in germany .
however , i think the comparison with 1970s britain that is occasionally drawn does not work .
germany 's economy has never been as bad and the trade unions never as strong as in the uk in those days .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
germany is not competitive enough due to structural problems .
the high cost of labor needs to be tackled .
flexibility is also very important .
instead of trade unions and employers negotiating the wages centrally they should be determined factory by factory .
i am not sure whether ultimately consumption needs to be boosted .
more importantly business confidence needs to be strengthened so as to encourage more investment in germany .
gerhard schröder or a n gela merkel ?
who is your perso n al choice for cha n cellor ?
no comment .
what do you like about germa n y ?
i like berlin .
it has the advantages of a village - it is very laid back - and combines them with the advantages of a big city .
i enjoy the great diversity of accents and local regions in the country .
it is fascinating to see how this variety plays out also in the political arena , for example in the constant debate on reform in the country but also the recent confrontations between bavaria and the east of germany .
what do you dislike about germa n y ?
there are a couple of small things i find frustrating .
i recently moved house and i had to repaint the walls in my old place for the next person to move in .
why ? ?
and there are the amounts banks charge for the privilege of me having an account with them .
oh yes , and when i went to an italian restaurant the other day they would only accept cash .
it makes you wonder what century they live in .
but all in all nothing major , really . ranty islam interviewed ray furlong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete coverage of the upcoming election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 fighting global corruption from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eigen , right , plans to continue to work for transparency twelve years after he founded it , peter eigen is stepping down as chief of transparency international .
the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself . in 1993 , after almost 25 years as world bank regional director for west and east africa and latin america , peter eigen could simply not take it anymore .
the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .
after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .
the organization 's yearly index targets not only developmental countries , but major industrial nations as well .
germany ranked 15th out of 145 countries last year , two places above the us , and nine above japan .
bangladesh and haiti are on the bottom of the list . anti-corruption measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international 's global corruption report critics have said that the corruption barometer , based on opinion polls , is n't always a reliable reflection of what is really going on .
eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .
" corruption is the biggest cause of poverty in the world , of violence , of impoverishment and hopelessness in many societies , " he said .
" and that 's why we need to fight it together . " klaus ulrich -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?

last year it posted a deficit of 3.7 percent .
the pact has thus been at the center of a row between germany and the eu commission for years .
the commission has accused germany of not doing enough to set its financial house in order and consolidate its policies . stability pact rewrite last year , the commission threatened to start disciplinary proceedings against the country , but the move was put on hold later . in recent months , germany along with france , another eu budgetary pact offender , has been at the forefront of a drive to water down the pact much to the anger of smaller eurozone members . in march this year , the efforts bore fruit after eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" in many countries , one can become a doctor , vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal .

though the german 's valiant time trial win was not enough , he remains optimistic . for the second time in four weeks , germany 's struggling cycling hero jan ullrich lost to an american .
after coming in third in the tour de france as lance armstrong seized his seventh , and final , victory , ullrich finished 31 seconds behind levi leipheimer in the tour of germany .
leipheimer , the 31-year-old leader of the gerolsteiner team , cruised to victory after beating ullrich on a crucial mountain stage last week .
" it 's great to win this race , " said leipheimer in bonn , where the nine-stage race concluded on tuesday .
" the race has matured , and it 's one of the best races in the world now . "
ullrich loses in the mountains leipheimer , who came in sixth in this year 's tour de france , won the tour 's fourth stage , the 2,670 meter rettenbachferner climb , effectively solidifying his lead over ullrich .
the rostock native , who was set on winning the tour in his home country , struggled against the american in the mountains , echoing similar lost battles against another american in the pyrenees and french alps .
" i would have liked to win - i was 31 seconds short in the end , and that 's a pity , " said ullrich .
" but i 'm very satisfied given the circumstances .
i did n't expect to be on the podium as my illness handicapped me . "

" gerolsteiner was simply better prepared and overall very strong .
they apparently recovered from the tour de france better than we did , " said ullrich .
" we suffered from sickness and the loss of -lrb- alexander -rrb- vinokurov . "
vinokurov switched to team liberty seguros after the tour de france .

eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .
" corruption is the biggest cause of poverty in the world , of violence , of impoverishment and hopelessness in many societies , " he said .
" and that 's why we need to fight it together . " klaus ulrich -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?
corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .

although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .

the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself . in 1993 , after almost 25 years as world bank regional director for west and east africa and latin america , peter eigen could simply not take it anymore .
the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .
after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .
the organization 's yearly index targets not only developmental countries , but major industrial nations as well .
germany ranked 15th out of 145 countries last year , two places above the us , and nine above japan .
bangladesh and haiti are on the bottom of the list . anti-corruption measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international 's global corruption report critics have said that the corruption barometer , based on opinion polls , is n't always a reliable reflection of what is really going on .
eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .
" corruption is the biggest cause of poverty in the world , of violence , of impoverishment and hopelessness in many societies , " he said .
" and that 's why we need to fight it together . " klaus ulrich -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?

the districts of garmisch-partenkirchen and kempten were the worst affected as volunteers and aid workers moved to secure dykes and inhabitants from low-lying areas prepared for evacuation .
rail services into and out of munich were crippled after key lines were closed owing to mudslides and high water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man transports sandbags on his tractor in garmisch-partenkirchen authorities said that the catastrophe was worse than the 1999 floods , deemed the worst in centuries at the time .
but they believed the worst was over as floodwaters crested tuesday afternoon in the bavarian alps .
officials warned of flood-spawned mudslides on steep alpine slopes as the waters headed northward to munich and the danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cantonal road is torn away next to the river emme in werthenstein , central switzerland .
mudslides have already completely isolated the town of balderschwang on the austrian border , which can only be reached by air .
crews worked to clear a path through the wall of mud , while in other locations across southern bavaria , hundreds of workers piled sandbags and helped with evacuation efforts .
no flood-related fatalities have been reported in germany but , in a dramatic rescue , a 19-year-old woman was plucked from her car by a truck driver after her vehicle was washed off the road .
death toll in neighboring countries also affected by the flood , however , the death toll has risen to six .
on tuesday , one person was killed when a swollen stream tore down eight houses in the swiss city of brienz .
a second victim was found drowned in a river in another town .
in southern tyrol in austria , one man was killed by a flood-triggered rockslide .
three other deaths were reported on sunday and monday in both austria and switzerland .
swiss television has been showing footage of collapsed bridges and motorways , and people being evacuated by boat through city streets .
authorities are already calculating damages to run into millions .
parts of the swiss capital of bern and the city of interlaken are already submerged , while several other towns have been cut off .
thousands of residents have been evacuated so far .

last year it posted a deficit of 3.7 percent .
the pact has thus been at the center of a row between germany and the eu commission for years .
the commission has accused germany of not doing enough to set its financial house in order and consolidate its policies . stability pact rewrite last year , the commission threatened to start disciplinary proceedings against the country , but the move was put on hold later . in recent months , germany along with france , another eu budgetary pact offender , has been at the forefront of a drive to water down the pact much to the anger of smaller eurozone members . in march this year , the efforts bore fruit after eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .
so the message is clear then : " less money and less power to pensioners !

luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 the end of east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final military parade of the german democratic republic fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war . sabine bergmann-pohl 's term in office as president of the east german parliament , and officially head of state , was short .
she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
like dozens before them , they received no punishment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 the end of east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final military parade of the german democratic republic fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war . sabine bergmann-pohl 's term in office as president of the east german parliament , and officially head of state , was short .
she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .

the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .

ray furlong : on the one hand , germany is still a very wealthy and prosperous society .
the problem is that is has n't had any decent economic growth for far too long .
unemployment figures also have n't come down significantly .
in economic terms the east of the country is still very much a burden .
a lot of money has been put into big projects there with no lasting benefits .
generally there there 's a bad vibe in germany .
however , i think the comparison with 1970s britain that is occasionally drawn does not work .
germany 's economy has never been as bad and the trade unions never as strong as in the uk in those days .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
germany is not competitive enough due to structural problems .
the high cost of labor needs to be tackled .
flexibility is also very important .
instead of trade unions and employers negotiating the wages centrally they should be determined factory by factory .
i am not sure whether ultimately consumption needs to be boosted .
more importantly business confidence needs to be strengthened so as to encourage more investment in germany .

with the general election coming up , dw-world talked to him about his views on the current situation in germany . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
ray furlong : on the one hand , germany is still a very wealthy and prosperous society .
the problem is that is has n't had any decent economic growth for far too long .
unemployment figures also have n't come down significantly .
in economic terms the east of the country is still very much a burden .
a lot of money has been put into big projects there with no lasting benefits .
generally there there 's a bad vibe in germany .
however , i think the comparison with 1970s britain that is occasionally drawn does not work .
germany 's economy has never been as bad and the trade unions never as strong as in the uk in those days .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
germany is not competitive enough due to structural problems .
the high cost of labor needs to be tackled .
flexibility is also very important .
instead of trade unions and employers negotiating the wages centrally they should be determined factory by factory .
i am not sure whether ultimately consumption needs to be boosted .
more importantly business confidence needs to be strengthened so as to encourage more investment in germany .

no comment .
what do you like about germa n y ?
i like berlin .
it has the advantages of a village - it is very laid back - and combines them with the advantages of a big city .
i enjoy the great diversity of accents and local regions in the country .
it is fascinating to see how this variety plays out also in the political arena , for example in the constant debate on reform in the country but also the recent confrontations between bavaria and the east of germany .

with the general election coming up , dw-world talked to him about his views on the current situation in germany . dw-world : how is germa n y doi n g i n your opi n io n ?
ray furlong : on the one hand , germany is still a very wealthy and prosperous society .
the problem is that is has n't had any decent economic growth for far too long .
unemployment figures also have n't come down significantly .
in economic terms the east of the country is still very much a burden .
a lot of money has been put into big projects there with no lasting benefits .
generally there there 's a bad vibe in germany .
however , i think the comparison with 1970s britain that is occasionally drawn does not work .
germany 's economy has never been as bad and the trade unions never as strong as in the uk in those days .
what n eeds to happe n i n germa n y to help speed up the cou n try 's recovery ?
germany is not competitive enough due to structural problems .
the high cost of labor needs to be tackled .
flexibility is also very important .
instead of trade unions and employers negotiating the wages centrally they should be determined factory by factory .
i am not sure whether ultimately consumption needs to be boosted .
more importantly business confidence needs to be strengthened so as to encourage more investment in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 seeking an end to animal experimentation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislation protects lab animals from cruelty or mistreatment consumer affairs minister renate künast opened the 5th international congress on alternatives to animal experimentation in berlin on monday , where some 850 experts are set to discuss the way forward . " we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .

why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" in many countries , one can become a doctor , vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal .

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .
so the message is clear then : " less money and less power to pensioners ! " ranty islam interviewed luke harding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe .
-lrb- aug .
6 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself . in 1993 , after almost 25 years as world bank regional director for west and east africa and latin america , peter eigen could simply not take it anymore .
the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .

last year it posted a deficit of 3.7 percent .
the pact has thus been at the center of a row between germany and the eu commission for years .
the commission has accused germany of not doing enough to set its financial house in order and consolidate its policies . stability pact rewrite last year , the commission threatened to start disciplinary proceedings against the country , but the move was put on hold later . in recent months , germany along with france , another eu budgetary pact offender , has been at the forefront of a drive to water down the pact much to the anger of smaller eurozone members . in march this year , the efforts bore fruit after eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .

proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 the end of east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final military parade of the german democratic republic fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war . sabine bergmann-pohl 's term in office as president of the east german parliament , and officially head of state , was short .
she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .

ray furlong : on the one hand , germany is still a very wealthy and prosperous society .
the problem is that is has n't had any decent economic growth for far too long .

germany is not competitive enough due to structural problems .
the high cost of labor needs to be tackled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 the end of east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final military parade of the german democratic republic fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war . sabine bergmann-pohl 's term in office as president of the east german parliament , and officially head of state , was short .
she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
like dozens before them , they received no punishment .

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the foreign media 's take on germany ray furlong yan li aktham suliman richard bernstein election 2005 -pipe- 23.08.2005 luke harding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " germany thinks it 's bangladesh " luke harding has been the berlin correspondent for british newspaper " the guardian " for two years .
he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .
so the message is clear then : " less money and less power to pensioners ! " ranty islam interviewed luke harding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe .
-lrb- aug .
6 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .
-lrb- aug .
15 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you agree with luke harding ?
please include your name and country of residence in any reply . picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

last year it posted a deficit of 3.7 percent .
the pact has thus been at the center of a row between germany and the eu commission for years .
the commission has accused germany of not doing enough to set its financial house in order and consolidate its policies . stability pact rewrite last year , the commission threatened to start disciplinary proceedings against the country , but the move was put on hold later . in recent months , germany along with france , another eu budgetary pact offender , has been at the forefront of a drive to water down the pact much to the anger of smaller eurozone members . in march this year , the efforts bore fruit after eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

last year it posted a deficit of 3.7 percent .
the pact has thus been at the center of a row between germany and the eu commission for years .
the commission has accused germany of not doing enough to set its financial house in order and consolidate its policies . stability pact rewrite last year , the commission threatened to start disciplinary proceedings against the country , but the move was put on hold later . in recent months , germany along with france , another eu budgetary pact offender , has been at the forefront of a drive to water down the pact much to the anger of smaller eurozone members . in march this year , the efforts bore fruit after eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself . in 1993 , after almost 25 years as world bank regional director for west and east africa and latin america , peter eigen could simply not take it anymore .
the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .
after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .

eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .

the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself . in 1993 , after almost 25 years as world bank regional director for west and east africa and latin america , peter eigen could simply not take it anymore .
the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .
after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .
the organization 's yearly index targets not only developmental countries , but major industrial nations as well .
germany ranked 15th out of 145 countries last year , two places above the us , and nine above japan .
bangladesh and haiti are on the bottom of the list . anti-corruption measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transparency international 's global corruption report critics have said that the corruption barometer , based on opinion polls , is n't always a reliable reflection of what is really going on .
eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .
" corruption is the biggest cause of poverty in the world , of violence , of impoverishment and hopelessness in many societies , " he said .
" and that 's why we need to fight it together . " klaus ulrich -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?

the former world bank director leaves behind an anti-corruption organization that has made a good name for itself . in 1993 , after almost 25 years as world bank regional director for west and east africa and latin america , peter eigen could simply not take it anymore .
the corruption that he witnessed during his tenure there and in the 1970s as a legal advisor to the governments of botswana and namibia , was something the lawyer thought needed special attention - and the bank , he said , was n't doing enough about it .
so he quit his job and started transparency international , a now global agency that has made noticeable strides in eliminating fraud and corruption in government hallways and corporate boardrooms .
the point was to take corruption from being considered a minor offense to being treated as a serious crime , and he chose " corruption kills " as transparency 's slogan to underscore the point . if the impressive press coverage and anti-corruption measures accepted by numerous governments are anything to go by , eigen has achieved his goal .
after 12 years as the organization 's chief , the 67-year-old said last week he will step down . transparency international , based in berlin , is present in 122 countries , with bureaus in 87 of them .

eigen soft-pedalled such criticism by saying that transparency 's true service was advising companies and countries . the organization has convinced local governments to accept so-called " integrity packages " that guard against pay-offs when public contracts are up for bids .
every company taking part in the bid has to sign such a contract .
those who break the rules are punished , either by being put on a worldwide blacklist , or having to pay damages to those who lose out on the contract .
" there are 200 companies on the black list at the world bank that no longer receive world bank contracts , " said eigen . stepping back , not down he 's even managed to make some progress in his own country .
german companies used to be able to deduct pay-offs made as part of deals in other countries from their german taxes - something not only widely practiced , but accepted in the past . the organization will elect a new president at their annual meeting in november this year .
though eigen no longer wants to be chief , he plans to continue working for his pet project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 seeking an end to animal experimentation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislation protects lab animals from cruelty or mistreatment consumer affairs minister renate künast opened the 5th international congress on alternatives to animal experimentation in berlin on monday , where some 850 experts are set to discuss the way forward . " we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" in many countries , one can become a doctor , vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .
" in many countries , one can become a doctor , vet or biologist without ever having performed an experiment on an animal .

last year it posted a deficit of 3.7 percent .
the pact has thus been at the center of a row between germany and the eu commission for years .
the commission has accused germany of not doing enough to set its financial house in order and consolidate its policies . stability pact rewrite last year , the commission threatened to start disciplinary proceedings against the country , but the move was put on hold later . in recent months , germany along with france , another eu budgetary pact offender , has been at the forefront of a drive to water down the pact much to the anger of smaller eurozone members . in march this year , the efforts bore fruit after eu ministers agreed on a plan that includes giving germany special treatment because of the high costs of reunification , which germany has said is largely to blame for its inability over the past three years to keep its deficit under the three-percent mark required by the original stability pact . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 the end of east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final military parade of the german democratic republic fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war . sabine bergmann-pohl 's term in office as president of the east german parliament , and officially head of state , was short .
she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .

she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .

" we have to ask ourselves in what ways animal experimentation is really necessary to making our lives safer , " said künast at the opening of the congress .
presenting the case for greater investment in alternatives , she said that germany was still a long way off the green party 's target of being europe 's leader in developing animal-free testing methods .
" the number of experiments conducted on animals in 2003 is slightly lower than in 2001 , " künast said .
" but the figures are still too high . "
in an interview with the daily der tagesspiegel , the minister said she even expected the number to rise once the eu 's new directive reach -lrb- registration , evaluation and authorisation of chemicals -rrb- is implemented .
its proposals regulate the use of some 30,000 toxic synthetic chemicals in everyday manufactured objects , largely based on animal testing strategies .
but künast conceded the issue was a complex one .
" there is a conflict of interests , " she said .
" efforts to protect our health and environment can not be wholly exempt from animal experimentation . "
controversial practices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around the world , animals are used to test products ranging from shampoo to new cancer drugs .
although animal experimentation is ultimately designed to ensure consumer protection , the practice has become increasingly controversial in recent years .
critics argue that animal testing is slower , crueller and more expensive than non-animal alternatives .
the scientists at the berlin congress will be examining efforts made by industry to replace animal experimentation in obligatory toxicity tests .
proposed alternatives include applications of modern bio-technology that allow , for example , scientists to simulate human skin and thereby test potentially adverse reactions without resorting to the use of animals .
another field heavily dependent on animal testing is pain research , with almost every medical treatment available first tested on animals .
animals are also used to develop anaesthetics to prevent pain during surgery .
progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but an end to animal experimentation is already in sight .
the practice has been cut back by 50 percent since 1989 , largely due to another eu directive that rules it can only be allowed in the absence of any viable alternative .
speaking in berlin on monday , künast singled out the cosmetics industry as exemplary in its development of alternative methods of product testing , while horst spielmann , director of the central office for collecting and assessing altrnatives to animal experimentation -lrb- zebet -rrb- , said progress has definitely been made .
" using animals in teaching curricula is already superfluous , " he told german broadcaster ard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2005 the end of east germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final military parade of the german democratic republic fifteen years ago , the parliament of former communist east germany decided that a reunified germany would be wiser and voted to join the west german state - a historical moment that ended 45 years of cold war . sabine bergmann-pohl 's term in office as president of the east german parliament , and officially head of state , was short .
she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .
like dozens before them , they received no punishment .

she held the post from april 5 to oct .
3 , 1990 but on aug .
23 of that year , the christian democratic politician would announce what was for most only unthinkable one year before , namely the dissolution of the german democratic republic , or east germany .
when , at 3 a.m. , bergmann-pohl announced the result of the vote , a tumultuous yet historic session came to an end .
the workers ' and farmers ' state had collapsed over the course of eight months after existing 40 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine bergmann-pohl reads the results of a parlimentary vote that would be the official death knell of the gdr before the vote , two camps stood at loggerheads and their goals were clear and uncompromising .
either the east germans would toss their dreams of a socialist state and reunify quickly with wealthier west germany , or the economically-decrepit gdr would try to retain some sense of its past and vote for independence , at least for the time being .
the answer was clear : 294 parliamentarians were for the dissolution of east germany .
only 62 were against it .
" parliament today decided nothing less , " said gregor gysi , then head of the pds party , the successor of the former ruling sed party , " than the destruction of the state of east germany to take place on oct .
3 , 1990 . "
protesters tired of state control in hindsight , the vote of aug .
23 was nothing but a rubber stamp for about 16 million east germans .
the protest wave that had begun in the autumn of 1989 had unleashed a series of events leading to the resignation of the country 's ruler erich honecker .
bildunterschrift : when people started dancing on the wall , they turned their back on east germany those who watched the momentous televised debate in parliament were not ready to give the satellite of the soviet union another chance .
" i ’ ve partly watched the session on television and it ’ s been quite an awkward spectacle .
it ’ s high time this farce came to an end , " one east german was then quoted as saying .
the pressure on the parliamentarians had reached a head .
the majority of the people had tasted freedom after nov .
9 , 1989 .
the time to carry the german democratic republic to its grave had neared .
the revolutionaries are toppled what had led up to the historic vote on aug .
23 , 1990 was a lesson in grassroots civics .
the new forum civic movement had initiated the monday demonstrations in leipzig in 1989 .
by the first free elections in march 1990 , however , the group had been eliminated from the political landscape .
the pro-western cdu swept into power , forcing into oblivion those groups that actually toppled communism in peaceful street protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president ronald reagan at the brandenburg gate " i see us as a group of people who happened to be in the first position at a closed and locked door .
we began hammering at the door and finally it gave way , we fell down and everybody rushed over us into the free air .
in one historic second we were in full agreement with the mood of the masses of the population .
but only for a second , " said jens reich , one of the leaders of the new forum civic movement .
can history be repeated ?
in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .

in the summer of 1990 , the east german state was virtually bankrupt , managing to survive only by hanging on the purse strings of western germany .
hard western deutsche marks were introduced in the east in june .
west german chancellor helmut kohl believed that free market economics would do the trick again and achieve a repeat of the west german post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi , earlier with the east german sed party , now part of the left party " this was a very simplistic concept .
the idea behind it was , we transfer the west german monetary system , put money into east germany and then after a chaotic round , new economic development might take place , " said jochen blaschke , an economist in berlin .
now , 15 years on , much of eastern germany continues to be economically depressed with high unemployment , low productivity and even less prospects - in spite of about 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 60 billion -rrb- pumped into the region every year .
blossoming landscapes were once promised to the people there , but what ’ s flourishing is disillusion and a renewed relish for leftwing policies .
it 's telling that gregor gysi , the leftist leader who once buried the communist party in the east , is now making a comeback there as co-leader of a new , nationwide far left party . uwe hessler -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .

he gave dw-world the lowdown on germany as he sees it . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
luke harding : germany is actually doing better than it thinks it is .
the mood is so incredibly depressed .
it 's almost like germany thinks it 's bangladesh .
but germany is and remains a big prosperous country with a marvelous infrastructure .
sometimes i really just feel like telling my german friends : " stop moaning ! ! "
on the other hand , it is true that germany has structural problems .
high levels of unemployment is one of the most pressing ones .
the country has never been through an era of " thatcherism " - something which helped the uk reform its labor market .
i think a real problem is this cultural pessimism - and i do n't understand why this is .
it seems like germans are only happy when they are not happy .
it must be something in the german psyche .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
what germany needs is a big , fat dose of neo-liberalism .
i think a cultural shift is needed towards us / uk practices as far as the question of getting a job is concerned .
i am not advocating hire and fire , but there is a need for greater flexibility and people have to realize that , yes , they have to do 5 or 6 jobs in a lifetime .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
that 's difficult .
merkel 's economic reforms - the initiatives on loosening the work protection laws , taxation etc - seem right .
then again , merkel is a deeply boring figure , and running an election campaign mainly on the pledge to up vat by two percent is not helping .
my feeling is that merkel 's germany is going to be a very gray place .
schröder in contrast is very colorful .
he 's the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with .
journalists like him .
but on virtually every other count he has failed .
unlike britain 's tony blair he has n't managed to convince his own party that his course is right .
so , i am not overly keen on either of the two , but then what i think does n't matter anyway , because germany will get merkel .
what do you like about germany ?
i have known germany for quite some time .
i first got here at age ten and then in my early teens i spent most summers with a really nice exchange family in cologne .
what i like about the country is that it works .
when i go to other places - like india - i make sure my siemens washing machine or my miele hoover is with me .
the public transport is marvelous , the german people are very friendly .
it 's a country to bring up kids in - as i do .
i have two young children , who attend an english school , but they also learn german .
what do you dislike about germany ?
all the rules !
everything seems to be " nicht gestattet " -lrb- not allowed -rrb- or " verboten " -lrb- prohibited -rrb- .
it is a bit frustrating - especially after i had just been to india .
oh yes , and in berlin , where i live , there are these old ladies who keep telling off my kids , who actually do behave quite reasonably .
it makes you wonder whether germany is ruled by old people - gerontocratic , so to say .
so the message is clear then : " less money and less power to pensioners ! " ranty islam interviewed luke harding send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe .
-lrb- aug .
6 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .
-lrb- aug .
15 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you agree with luke harding ?
please include your name and country of residence in any reply . picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

the cousins of jean charles de menezes were told he had not run into london 's stockwell tube station and had not vaulted the ticket barrier , it said .
they were also told he was not wearing a padded jacket , contradicting reports .
scotland yard issued a statement after a " positive " meeting with senior brazilian officials on monday .
' constructive meeting ' wagner goncalves , of brazil 's federal prosecutor 's office , and marcio pereira pinto garcia , of its ministry of justice , flew to the uk on monday to look into the circumstances surrounding the killing of the 27-year-old electrician .
they met members of the metropolitan police , including metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair , in a discussion chaired by deputy assistant commissioner john yates .
-lsb- we want -rsb- to understand a little bit better how the system works , how the ipcc works and what 's the legislation that 's going to be applied marcio pereira pinto garcia brazilian government official the are also due to meet representatives from the independent police complaints commission -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , which is investigating the case .
in a statement following the meeting , scotland yard said it had been " positive and constructive " and had covered the protocols of the investigation , but had not gone into specifics because of the ipcc inquiry .
it also said : " mr yates outlined the details given by police to the family and brazilian consulate officials in the aftermath of this tragedy .
" he said that on sunday , july 24 , mr de menezes ' family in the uk , his cousins , were briefed by police that mr de menezes did not run into the tube station , that he used a ticket to get through the tube station barrier - specifically that he did not vault the barrier - and that he was not wearing a padded jacket or carrying a bag . "
he also reiterated the apology made to the family for the death of mr menezes , scotland yard said .
mother 's ' suffering ' mr menezes ' mother has said action must be taken against the metropolitan police .
mother 's interview " they took my son 's life .
i am suffering because of that , " she told bbc news .
" i want the policeman who did that punished .
they ended not only my son 's life , but mine as well . "
on monday up to 200 supporters of mr menezes ' family attended a protest vigil at downing street to mark a month since he was shot .
his cousin handed in a letter to the prime minister calling for a public inquiry .
leaked documents from the ipcc investigation into the death last week appeared to contradict initial police and witness statements about the incident .
scotland yard had been quoted as saying that mr menezes ' " clothing and behaviour " added to suspicions on 22 july - a day after four failed bombings on the transport network - that he was a suicide bomber .
cash rejected but a leaked photograph of the body of mr menezes on the tube showed he was wearing a denim jacket at the time of the shooting- not a bulky one as previously described by a witness .
giovanni da silva , mr menezes ' brother , called on the metropolitan police to " show all the video from the underground so the world can see what they did to an innocent man " .
scotland yard has confirmed that an offer of £ 15,000 - which it stressed was an " ex gratia " payment which would not affect any further compensation or legal action - had been made to the menezes family .
the family rejected the offer , which is said to have caused them offence .
their solicitor gareth peirce said the offer may have been a " deliberate attempt to ensnare families into inappropriate agreements or inappropriate decisions " .
a memorial mass will be held on tuesday at 1930 bst at the brazilian chaplaincy in westminster diocese , st anne 's church , east london , in memory of mr menezes .

freddie is the star of a rent-a-hamster scheme which is being run by a swansea pet shop .
pat and jim robinson hire him out for £ 5 a week , so parents can find out whether children really want a pet .
" it 's difficult to tell whether a child will really take to it or lose interest after a few days , " mr robinson said .
" the idea stemmed from our passion for animal welfare .
hamsters are generally quite cheap pets , and therefore they are more likely to be an impulse buy .
" if parents can rent one for a week , they can find out whether it 's just a passing phase or not .
at the same time , it teaches children about being responsible for a pet . "
freddie arrives at each new home complete with cage , food , bedding , and care manual .
pat robinson said some people who could not commit to a pet full-time were turning to renting as an option .
" there are some busy families who have n't the time to commit to looking after an animal full-time but , at the same time do n't want to deprive their child of the pleasure of having a pet in the house , " she explained .
' loves attention ' " some will rent a hamster from us again and again , particularly during the school holidays when their children are able to give the hamster their full attention .
" hamsters are very stress-free , so moving from house to house does n't bother freddie .
he copes well with a change of environment .
freddie is very personable and loves lots of handling and lots of attention .
he seems to thrive on it .
" before he goes to someone 's home , we talk the children through feeding him and cleaning his cage . "
the sad reality about hamsters is that they only have short lives - most only live to around the age of two .
consequently , freddie is the third hamster they have put out to rent - following in the footsteps of daisy and freckles .

eu officials are to fly to china on wednesday to try and resolve the dispute which has driven a wedge between manufacturers and retailers .
about 75 million items such as shirts and bras are being held at eu ports after china exceeded import quotas .

china has breached import quotas in six out of ten categories of clothing covered by an agreement reached in june .
because of these restrictions , about 59 million sweaters and 17 million pairs of trousers which have been ordered by european retailers and shipped from china can not be sold on the market .
brussels has previously indicated that it might be willing to adjust the terms of the june agreement to break the current impasse .
national pressure this could see some of next year 's clothing quota being brought forward to this year or limits on certain items being eased .
european retailers have expressed fears that the dispute will leave them with empty shelves this winter .
however , brussels has been under pressure from several member states to take a tough line with china .

machynlleth town council has written to welsh newspapers in the two countries in a bid to raise some of the £ 164,000 needed .
the 78-foot tall timepiece was built in 1873 , but it requires a major overhaul .
it is hoped that the town 's link with owain glyndwr will spark interest in the clock appeal with people overseas .
so far , it has taken fund raisers three years to accumulate about £ 20,000 towards the repair bill .
chair of the appeal fund , glenda jenkins , said town mayor bob dunn had written to newspapers beth nesa , in australia , and ninnau , in the united states , asking readers for help .
we hope machynlleth 's links with owain glyndwr will spark interest glenda jenkins mrs jenkins said : " we thought it would be a good idea to write to the newspapers , but we 're not sure how much , if anything , we will raise .
" the town council has pledged to raise £ 25,000 and so far we 've got about £ 20,500 .
another £ 25,000 is coming from cadw , although we have n't received cadw 's grant yet . "
she added : " we 're looking at other grant opportunities too , but we do n't want to raise council tax to pay for the restoration " .
" we hope machynlleth 's links with owain glyndwr will spark interest in the appeal with people overseas " .
the clock 's list of repairs floor timbers electrical wiring remove rooted saplings remove lichen growth re-point mortar joints the campaign to restore the town landmark began three years ago .
the clock was built to celebrate the 21st birthday of viscount castlereagh , the son of the fifth marquess of londonderry , who lived at y plas in machynlleth .
two years ago a couple from hong kong who visited machynlleth in 2002 donated £ 1,000 to the restoration fund .
mrs jenkins wrote to celebrities asking them to donate memorabilia which was sold at an auction .
in 2003 , she received a signed book and photo from welsh movie star ioan gruffudd as well as a signed pennant from everton football club .

whittard 's shares soared by more than 30 % when it first confirmed takeover interest in the middle of july .
it said a number of parties had still expressed an interest in the company .
" whilst the retail climate remains very tough across the uk , like-for-like sales at the company 's high street / mall stores are ahead of the corresponding period last year , albeit at a lower gross margin , " whittard said .
the firm also bemoaned widespread general discounting in the uk high street .
whittard did not name any of the companies that had expressed an interest in buying the business .

security firm sunbelt software said it stumbled across a us-based server storing megabytes of data stolen from compromised computers while researching spyware infections .
the server held passwords for online accounts from 50 banks , ebay and paypal logins , hundreds of credit card numbers and reams of personal data .
the fbi has reportedly now started investigating the ring of id thieves .
hidden data the bug that has stolen all the data is thought to be a variant of a family of trojans known as dumaru or nibu that exploit a vulnerability in microsoft 's internet explorer browser .
the trojan , a malicious piece of code , automatically downloaded itself on computers when people visited sites harbouring the program . "
the way the data is laid out , the quality of it , it 's very easy to go through and use it for nefarious purposes " eric sites , sunbelt software the hidden payload in this bug is a keylogger that grabs a copy of everything a user types .
what made this bug so effective was its ability to grab text stored on the clipboard and by internet explorer , said eric sites , vice president of research and development at sunbelt software .
microsoft 's browser has a feature , called autocomplete , that automatically populates boxes on web forms where people typically fill in names , addresses , e-mail addresses , credit card numbers and other biographical details .
the feature is supposed to make filling in forms on websites less of a chore .
in this case , said mr sites , it helped the id thieves get hold of enormously valuable data .
typically a keylogger produces a file containing an unbroken string of characters , said mr sites .
" it 's usually very hard to take that and do anything with it , " he told the bbc news website .
by contrast , autocomplete data is already labelled and sorted because the browser has to know where to put each item .
" the way the data is laid out , the quality of it , it 's very easy to go through and use it for nefarious purposes , " he said .
" this is about getting money and stealing . "
megabytes of data the bbc news website was shown the server and some of the files containing personal data that it was storing .
each file was full of login names , e-mail addresses , credit card details and everything needed to steal someone 's identity or simply empty their bank account .
analysis of information in the files revealed login details for online services at 50 banks as well as user details for many ebay and paypal accounts .
one bank account had more than $ 380,000 in it .
sunbelt has contacted some of the people identified in the files to warn them that they have fallen victim to the bug .
banks , credit card firms , ebay and paypal have been told about compromised accounts .
the server at the centre of the id theft ring had many multi-megabyte sized files on it , said mr sites .
the server , which was based in the us , was regularly cleaned out by the thieves who created the trojan .
infected machines sent files back hourly or when the logs of data they were collecting had reached a certain size .
browser danger mr sites said that , so far , the trojan had been found on porn sites and websites offering cracks for pirated software .
but , he said , the trojan was likely to be on many other websites as it had managed to infect so many users .
sunbelt believes the trojan has been circulating for about three weeks and in that time has probably infected thousands of victims .
the vulnerability it exploits means that all a user has to do to fall victim is to visit the wrong site .
" type in a web link and your machine is infected , " said mr sites .
" you do not have to click on anything , the website forces the installation . "
many victims may have no idea that they have been infected .
" this version of the trojan was very successful , " he said .
" it was very small , hard to detect , the file had a very innocuous name and did not cause any problems to the machine .
the size and sophistication of the id theft ring led anti-virus and security companies to quickly produce tools that can spot if a machine has been compromised by the server and clean up infected machines .
the trojan was tricky to spot because the files being sent back to the server were disguised as data traffic generated by a user 's browser .
the us-based security company has alerted the fbi to the online scam and it is reportedly investigating the matter .

tabloid reports said phoenix , who plays the late country star in walk the line , became upset while filming a scene about the death of cash 's brother jack .
phoenix also lost his brother , river , who died in 1993 at the age of 23 .
the gladiator actor also told newsweek magazine the suggestion he drew on his own experiences for the scene " kind of makes me sick " .
phoenix said he was simply acting , not having a breakdown .
" i do n't need to pull from my experience for a character , and i 've never understood why actors would , except for lack of ability , imagination or research , " he said .
" i had all three things , so this is a little frustrating to me , because it denies my work and the research that i did . "
' makes me sick ' he added : " it bothers me that this happens , because it 's slightly exploitative .
" suggesting that i would use this personal part of my life for a movie ... it kind of makes me sick . "
the 30-year-old , who starred in the village and gladiator , said he resented the media imposing the image of " mourning brother " on him since his brother 's death from an overdose in 1993 .
phoenix recently admitted himself to a rehabilitation clinic for treatment for alcohol abuse .

but it does n't take very long before he demonstrates he is not the type to walk away from a fight .
within minutes of my arriving at his hampstead office he hit out at rmt general secretary bob crow accusing him of trying to use the london bombings to get his members better terms and conditions . "
i would want to see people on there trained in security and possibly trained in the use of firearms " keith norman aslef chief suggests armed marshals keith norman says he nearly walked out of a meeting with ken livingstone and mr crow about boosting security on london transport .
mr norman told the bbc news website : " when we got there it became very obvious that bob was using the situation to get his members a 35 hour week and to recruit 600 guards on to the tube and i felt sick .
" i was not prepared to listen to this and i was about to say to ken livingstone ' would you excuse me i 've had enough ' and i was just going to walk out the room .
" there were 52 people lying dead and bob was going to use the situation ... at best that 's insensitive , at worst that 's sickening . "
norman , whose hampstead office contains two thick files on an ongoing dispute with the rmt , said his union is waiting for a meeting at the tuc about the difficulties .
late for meeting ?
he alleges mr crow is trying to recruit aslef members and warns if the rmt gets chucked out of the tuc it will become a " leper " trade union .
his remarks are likely to be seen as a gauntlet to the left-wing rmt chief who is not known for a fear of confrontation .
responding later to the aslef boss ' comments , mr crow said mr norman had arrived 20 minutes late for the meeting with the capital 's mayor and missed part of the discussions which covered the fact london underground wanted to lose 800 staff in exchange for a shorter working week - agreed before the bombings took place .
" i am surprised if he 's got something to say he does n't come to me rather than going behind my back , " mr crow said before denying he had tried to poach aslef members .
mr norman was only formally elected in june after several months as the caretaker general secretary .
his predecessor , shaun brady , was sacked for alleged gross misconduct .
bleeding money ?
the new general secretary says the union nearly collapsed last year under the weight of debts exceeding £ 500,000 .
norman puts most of the blame at the feet of mr brady who lost his job in the wake of his alleged involvement in a brawl at a barbecue at the union 's hampstead hq .
" we still have n't got rid of all our deficit .
we 've made some substantial savings .
this place was bleeding money , " says mr norman .
" there were people making all kinds of claims on expenses - i do n't want to go into it too much - but money was dripping out of this building like an uncontrollable tap . "
the every day working class boy or girl is not the every day train driver " keith norman " it was just drip , drip , drip .
it was getting worse and worse and worse .
eventually after about eight months we arrested that , we paid off all the debts . "
mr brady , now running a pub in southampton , said he did not want to comment on his successor 's remarks .
but he did say he was planning legal action against aslef and was also trying to take the union to an employment tribunal .
he has previously disputed the suggestion he was responsible for the union 's debts .
mr norman certainly has a very different style from his predecessor - his door is left open throughout our conversation and a few people pop their heads around it . £ 40k train drivers at the same time he appears not to be averse to controversy .
the day we meet he says he 's in a " bloody bad mood " because of a spat with union 's executive council .
but office politics aside , recent times have been good to many train drivers .
those who win jobs on eurostar get paid " well over £ 40,000 plus overtime " .
the effect of this , norman says , is a different kind person is attracted to the job - ex-teachers and an ex-veterinary surgeon are among aslef 's members .
" the everyday working class boy or girl is not the everyday train driver . "
solidarity with columbia that , he implies , caused problems when mick rix , mr brady 's predecessor as general secretary , was in charge because of some of the political campaigns being run .
" i actually think that the fall in membership started before shaun actually arrived here , " he says .
" the union came in for a great deal of criticism for supporting causes in columbia , for example , in venezuela , in cuba .
i have to say that this union is an international union and i support all these issues , so does the executive and so does a fair-sized majority of the membership , " says mr norman . "
we are running a deficit of about £ 80,000 which compared to the £ 500,000 i inherited is a vast improvement " keith norman but he adds they need to be explained properly to the membership .
" what we have to explain to our members is that every time they go to a branch meeting they can criticise their union , they can criticise their officials , they can actually have a branch meeting , that is something that does n't happen in columbia because just to have a meeting you might disappear , you might get shot , you might get tortured or maimed .
sometimes the membership needs to be gently advised of that . "
norman says he 's been in the labour party for over 30 years and he argues tony blair 's government has let the railways down .
state of aslef ?
" there are times when i feel like getting up and criticising it but i 'll do it in a constructive way and on the basis that i 'm not leaving the labour party . "
so what does he think about the labour conference that saw ministers ignoring the will of the party when members backed rail renationalisation ?
" what 's the point of going to a conference where a democratic decision is taken and the government says ' well you can do what you like but we 're not going to take any notice ' ?
that 's a recipe for death - not just for the labour government but the labour party . "
so talking of death what state is aslef in now ?
" the general secretary is an administrator - i have to make sure this building is functioning properly .
i 've got a damn good finance manager - there 's an excellent team in there and it 's through their efforts that this union 's been pulled around .
we are running a deficit of about £ 80,000 which compared to the £ 500,000 i inherited is a vast improvement . "
