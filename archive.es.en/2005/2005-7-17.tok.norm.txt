germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .

" after the third night you start to only see the downsides , " which is when he says it is time to go back to civilization .

germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .
but the walk up is not the only thing that is steep , with prices for the smallest of the houses starting at 160 euros -lrb- $ 191 -rrb- including breakfast .
buffalo bill in the trees bergmann , who bears a resemblance to buffalo bill and likes to go by the name king bergamo , brushed aside remarks that the lodgings are rather rustic for the three-star prices .
" we offer more than lodgings , we offer an experience , " he said . other innovations offered at the complex , a three-hour drive south from berlin , include a night in an indian teepee and a stay in an underground dwelling set in an artificial cave .
at its door , a giant " cannibal cauldron " - a mammoth cast-iron pot over a bonfire - awaits guests eager for a bath . king bergamo does not see his competition among traditional hotels and is quick to point to the problems of a holiday in the treetops . " everything is cramped , it 's not comfortable , " he said .
" after the third night you start to only see the downsides , " which is when he says it is time to go back to civilization .
" it would be a shame to leave with a bad impression . " in the years following german reunification the site was a prototype playground used as a showroom for bergmann 's carpentry business .
today the park and the company employ some 50 people , in a depressed corner of eastern germany where one in four is out of a job . bergmann can not yet survive on the income from his adventure park alone but makes a living from fantasy constructions with orders pouring in from across europe .
elaborate playgrounds for malaga in spain and the belgian town of lilse bergen , robin hood huts for england 's sherwood forest in nottingham and a tropical house for the vienna 's schönbrunn park are all in the works . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .
but the people of both towns are already thinking in terms of one city .

" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .

" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .

mismanagement has made things go very wrong in the cradle of german classicism , weimar . the devastating fire that gutted the anna amalia library in weimar last september destroyed a jewel in the town 's cultural crown .
but a recent report has found that many other landmarks in the eastern german city are endangered .
a commission set up by the prussian cultural heritage foundation -lrb- spk -rrb- examined the state of weimar 's cultural affairs .
it has now accused the foundation created to preserve and manage the town 's cultural heritage , stiftung weimarer klassik -lrb- swkk -rrb- , of serious mismanagement .
and it warns that weimar 's treasures are under threat .
" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .
results are deeply disturbing according to lehmann , weimar 's graphic art collection is one example of a jeopardized cultural good .
" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .

germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .

each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .
but the walk up is not the only thing that is steep , with prices for the smallest of the houses starting at 160 euros -lrb- $ 191 -rrb- including breakfast .
buffalo bill in the trees bergmann , who bears a resemblance to buffalo bill and likes to go by the name king bergamo , brushed aside remarks that the lodgings are rather rustic for the three-star prices .
" we offer more than lodgings , we offer an experience , " he said . other innovations offered at the complex , a three-hour drive south from berlin , include a night in an indian teepee and a stay in an underground dwelling set in an artificial cave .
at its door , a giant " cannibal cauldron " - a mammoth cast-iron pot over a bonfire - awaits guests eager for a bath . king bergamo does not see his competition among traditional hotels and is quick to point to the problems of a holiday in the treetops . " everything is cramped , it 's not comfortable , " he said .
" after the third night you start to only see the downsides , " which is when he says it is time to go back to civilization .
" it would be a shame to leave with a bad impression . " in the years following german reunification the site was a prototype playground used as a showroom for bergmann 's carpentry business .
today the park and the company employ some 50 people , in a depressed corner of eastern germany where one in four is out of a job . bergmann can not yet survive on the income from his adventure park alone but makes a living from fantasy constructions with orders pouring in from across europe .
elaborate playgrounds for malaga in spain and the belgian town of lilse bergen , robin hood huts for england 's sherwood forest in nottingham and a tropical house for the vienna 's schönbrunn park are all in the works . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .

mismanagement has made things go very wrong in the cradle of german classicism , weimar . the devastating fire that gutted the anna amalia library in weimar last september destroyed a jewel in the town 's cultural crown .
but a recent report has found that many other landmarks in the eastern german city are endangered .
a commission set up by the prussian cultural heritage foundation -lrb- spk -rrb- examined the state of weimar 's cultural affairs .
it has now accused the foundation created to preserve and manage the town 's cultural heritage , stiftung weimarer klassik -lrb- swkk -rrb- , of serious mismanagement .
and it warns that weimar 's treasures are under threat .
" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .
results are deeply disturbing according to lehmann , weimar 's graphic art collection is one example of a jeopardized cultural good .
" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .
" these are all things that deeply disturb us . "
he said that authorities had become more sensitive since the fire in the 18th century anna amalia library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many works destroyed in the library 's famous rococo room the blaze destroyed 50,000 precious and mostly irreplaceable volumes and badly damaged a further 60,000 .
the total estimated damage amounted to some 67 million euros -lrb- $ 81.7 million -rrb- .
the library 's centerpiece , the famous rococo room , was also destroyed .
weimar 's fortunes are slumping weimar is known to tourists around the world as a picture-perfect town .
the cradle of german classicism - once the home of goethe and schiller - has played host to some of the greatest european artists and intellectuals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city 's most famous citizens : goethe und schiller after german unification , the government and the european union pumped millions of euros into the city to restore its former splendor .
weimar got another boost when it was named eu cultural capital in 1999 .
the town hosted an ambitious cultural program and drew many visitors .
but when it was over , weimar 's fortunes slumped again .
no glossing over the facts the blaze in the anna amalia library was started by a cable fire .
now , experts fear the same could happen elsewhere in weimar - for example in the city castle , and in particular the rooms that house the collection of prints and drawings .
the commission was highly critical of conditions there .
hellmut seemann , swkk 's president , said the findings were " devastating . "
" but it is an accurate assessment of the situation and there 's no way we can gloss over the fact , " said seemann .
" conditions in the museum are catastrophic . "
weimar needs to wake up in response to the commission 's report , the government has thrown weimar a life line of fresh cash .
due to this additional funding , the foundation was able to improve the situation in the summer months - at least provisionally .
some of the funds are earmarked for the preservation of goethe 's drawings , of which only a third have been restored so far .
but experts say merely saving what is there is not enough .
the town needs to wake up to its responsibilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the great-granddaughter of famous composer richard wagner " weimar always needs fresh wind , " said nike wagner , head of weimar 's arts festival .
" weimar has an unhealthy tradition of rejecting whatever is new and modern . "
it had snubbed the art nouveau and bauhaus movements , for example .
" the people of weimar have always tried to exclude whatever is modern , and remain fixated on images of classicism , " said wagner .
weimar needs a vision another problem is the contemporary art collection in the " new museum . "
fewer than 5,000 visitors came last year .
the modern works seem neglected and unloved , compared to the treasures of earlier centuries .
renowned art collector paul maenz had loaned the museum many important works .
now , he wants the works back .
it 's a slap in the face for weimar and those in charge of its arts policy .
" nostalgia for the past is not enough , " said lehmann .
" in order to define one 's place in today 's world , one needs vision , one needs to explore new approaches .
i think people failed to grasp what it meant for mr. maenz to loan his collection to the neues museum . "
saving weimar 's legacy the commission said a proper visitors center should be created in the city castle , the schloss .
the experts also want to build a central storage facility for weimar 's art treasures .
the city , they said , must shape up for the 21st century .
" i will take great pains to ensure that everyone , apart from the public who can always say ' it 's all rubbish , ' who shares responsibility for this foundation furthers these goals , " said seemann .
the government has earmarked 10 million euros in emergency funds for weimar .

germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .

" it would be a shame to leave with a bad impression . " in the years following german reunification the site was a prototype playground used as a showroom for bergmann 's carpentry business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.07.2005 weimar 's last chance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weimar needs to do more for its heritage , like the schiller museum an icon of german culture is under threat .
mismanagement has made things go very wrong in the cradle of german classicism , weimar . the devastating fire that gutted the anna amalia library in weimar last september destroyed a jewel in the town 's cultural crown .
but a recent report has found that many other landmarks in the eastern german city are endangered .
a commission set up by the prussian cultural heritage foundation -lrb- spk -rrb- examined the state of weimar 's cultural affairs .
it has now accused the foundation created to preserve and manage the town 's cultural heritage , stiftung weimarer klassik -lrb- swkk -rrb- , of serious mismanagement .
and it warns that weimar 's treasures are under threat .
" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .
results are deeply disturbing according to lehmann , weimar 's graphic art collection is one example of a jeopardized cultural good .
" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .
" these are all things that deeply disturb us . "
he said that authorities had become more sensitive since the fire in the 18th century anna amalia library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many works destroyed in the library 's famous rococo room the blaze destroyed 50,000 precious and mostly irreplaceable volumes and badly damaged a further 60,000 .
the total estimated damage amounted to some 67 million euros -lrb- $ 81.7 million -rrb- .
the library 's centerpiece , the famous rococo room , was also destroyed .
weimar 's fortunes are slumping weimar is known to tourists around the world as a picture-perfect town .
the cradle of german classicism - once the home of goethe and schiller - has played host to some of the greatest european artists and intellectuals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city 's most famous citizens : goethe und schiller after german unification , the government and the european union pumped millions of euros into the city to restore its former splendor .
weimar got another boost when it was named eu cultural capital in 1999 .
the town hosted an ambitious cultural program and drew many visitors .
but when it was over , weimar 's fortunes slumped again .
no glossing over the facts the blaze in the anna amalia library was started by a cable fire .
now , experts fear the same could happen elsewhere in weimar - for example in the city castle , and in particular the rooms that house the collection of prints and drawings .
the commission was highly critical of conditions there .
hellmut seemann , swkk 's president , said the findings were " devastating . "
" but it is an accurate assessment of the situation and there 's no way we can gloss over the fact , " said seemann .
" conditions in the museum are catastrophic . "
weimar needs to wake up in response to the commission 's report , the government has thrown weimar a life line of fresh cash .
due to this additional funding , the foundation was able to improve the situation in the summer months - at least provisionally .
some of the funds are earmarked for the preservation of goethe 's drawings , of which only a third have been restored so far .
but experts say merely saving what is there is not enough .
the town needs to wake up to its responsibilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the great-granddaughter of famous composer richard wagner " weimar always needs fresh wind , " said nike wagner , head of weimar 's arts festival .
" weimar has an unhealthy tradition of rejecting whatever is new and modern . "
it had snubbed the art nouveau and bauhaus movements , for example .
" the people of weimar have always tried to exclude whatever is modern , and remain fixated on images of classicism , " said wagner .
weimar needs a vision another problem is the contemporary art collection in the " new museum . "
fewer than 5,000 visitors came last year .
the modern works seem neglected and unloved , compared to the treasures of earlier centuries .
renowned art collector paul maenz had loaned the museum many important works .
now , he wants the works back .
it 's a slap in the face for weimar and those in charge of its arts policy .
" nostalgia for the past is not enough , " said lehmann .
" in order to define one 's place in today 's world , one needs vision , one needs to explore new approaches .
i think people failed to grasp what it meant for mr. maenz to loan his collection to the neues museum . "
saving weimar 's legacy the commission said a proper visitors center should be created in the city castle , the schloss .
the experts also want to build a central storage facility for weimar 's art treasures .
the city , they said , must shape up for the 21st century .
" i will take great pains to ensure that everyone , apart from the public who can always say ' it 's all rubbish , ' who shares responsibility for this foundation furthers these goals , " said seemann .
the government has earmarked 10 million euros in emergency funds for weimar .
many believe it 's the city 's last chance to save its legacy as the home of germany 's cultural titans . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the sorrows of young schiller german icon friedrich schiller died 200 years ago in may - an anniversary marked in weimar with the opening of a special " schiller year .

mismanagement has made things go very wrong in the cradle of german classicism , weimar . the devastating fire that gutted the anna amalia library in weimar last september destroyed a jewel in the town 's cultural crown .
but a recent report has found that many other landmarks in the eastern german city are endangered .
a commission set up by the prussian cultural heritage foundation -lrb- spk -rrb- examined the state of weimar 's cultural affairs .
it has now accused the foundation created to preserve and manage the town 's cultural heritage , stiftung weimarer klassik -lrb- swkk -rrb- , of serious mismanagement .
and it warns that weimar 's treasures are under threat .
" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .
results are deeply disturbing according to lehmann , weimar 's graphic art collection is one example of a jeopardized cultural good .
" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .
" these are all things that deeply disturb us . "
he said that authorities had become more sensitive since the fire in the 18th century anna amalia library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many works destroyed in the library 's famous rococo room the blaze destroyed 50,000 precious and mostly irreplaceable volumes and badly damaged a further 60,000 .
the total estimated damage amounted to some 67 million euros -lrb- $ 81.7 million -rrb- .
the library 's centerpiece , the famous rococo room , was also destroyed .
weimar 's fortunes are slumping weimar is known to tourists around the world as a picture-perfect town .
the cradle of german classicism - once the home of goethe and schiller - has played host to some of the greatest european artists and intellectuals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city 's most famous citizens : goethe und schiller after german unification , the government and the european union pumped millions of euros into the city to restore its former splendor .
weimar got another boost when it was named eu cultural capital in 1999 .
the town hosted an ambitious cultural program and drew many visitors .
but when it was over , weimar 's fortunes slumped again .
no glossing over the facts the blaze in the anna amalia library was started by a cable fire .
now , experts fear the same could happen elsewhere in weimar - for example in the city castle , and in particular the rooms that house the collection of prints and drawings .
the commission was highly critical of conditions there .
hellmut seemann , swkk 's president , said the findings were " devastating . "
" but it is an accurate assessment of the situation and there 's no way we can gloss over the fact , " said seemann .
" conditions in the museum are catastrophic . "
weimar needs to wake up in response to the commission 's report , the government has thrown weimar a life line of fresh cash .
due to this additional funding , the foundation was able to improve the situation in the summer months - at least provisionally .
some of the funds are earmarked for the preservation of goethe 's drawings , of which only a third have been restored so far .
but experts say merely saving what is there is not enough .
the town needs to wake up to its responsibilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the great-granddaughter of famous composer richard wagner " weimar always needs fresh wind , " said nike wagner , head of weimar 's arts festival .
" weimar has an unhealthy tradition of rejecting whatever is new and modern . "
it had snubbed the art nouveau and bauhaus movements , for example .
" the people of weimar have always tried to exclude whatever is modern , and remain fixated on images of classicism , " said wagner .
weimar needs a vision another problem is the contemporary art collection in the " new museum . "
fewer than 5,000 visitors came last year .
the modern works seem neglected and unloved , compared to the treasures of earlier centuries .
renowned art collector paul maenz had loaned the museum many important works .
now , he wants the works back .
it 's a slap in the face for weimar and those in charge of its arts policy .
" nostalgia for the past is not enough , " said lehmann .
" in order to define one 's place in today 's world , one needs vision , one needs to explore new approaches .
i think people failed to grasp what it meant for mr. maenz to loan his collection to the neues museum . "
saving weimar 's legacy the commission said a proper visitors center should be created in the city castle , the schloss .
the experts also want to build a central storage facility for weimar 's art treasures .
the city , they said , must shape up for the 21st century .
" i will take great pains to ensure that everyone , apart from the public who can always say ' it 's all rubbish , ' who shares responsibility for this foundation furthers these goals , " said seemann .
the government has earmarked 10 million euros in emergency funds for weimar .

germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .

at its door , a giant " cannibal cauldron " - a mammoth cast-iron pot over a bonfire - awaits guests eager for a bath . king bergamo does not see his competition among traditional hotels and is quick to point to the problems of a holiday in the treetops . " everything is cramped , it 's not comfortable , " he said .
" after the third night you start to only see the downsides , " which is when he says it is time to go back to civilization .
" it would be a shame to leave with a bad impression . " in the years following german reunification the site was a prototype playground used as a showroom for bergmann 's carpentry business .

mismanagement has made things go very wrong in the cradle of german classicism , weimar . the devastating fire that gutted the anna amalia library in weimar last september destroyed a jewel in the town 's cultural crown .
but a recent report has found that many other landmarks in the eastern german city are endangered .
a commission set up by the prussian cultural heritage foundation -lrb- spk -rrb- examined the state of weimar 's cultural affairs .
it has now accused the foundation created to preserve and manage the town 's cultural heritage , stiftung weimarer klassik -lrb- swkk -rrb- , of serious mismanagement .
and it warns that weimar 's treasures are under threat .
" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .
results are deeply disturbing according to lehmann , weimar 's graphic art collection is one example of a jeopardized cultural good .
" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .
" these are all things that deeply disturb us . "
he said that authorities had become more sensitive since the fire in the 18th century anna amalia library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many works destroyed in the library 's famous rococo room the blaze destroyed 50,000 precious and mostly irreplaceable volumes and badly damaged a further 60,000 .
the total estimated damage amounted to some 67 million euros -lrb- $ 81.7 million -rrb- .
the library 's centerpiece , the famous rococo room , was also destroyed .

mismanagement has made things go very wrong in the cradle of german classicism , weimar . the devastating fire that gutted the anna amalia library in weimar last september destroyed a jewel in the town 's cultural crown .
but a recent report has found that many other landmarks in the eastern german city are endangered .
a commission set up by the prussian cultural heritage foundation -lrb- spk -rrb- examined the state of weimar 's cultural affairs .
it has now accused the foundation created to preserve and manage the town 's cultural heritage , stiftung weimarer klassik -lrb- swkk -rrb- , of serious mismanagement .
and it warns that weimar 's treasures are under threat .
" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .
results are deeply disturbing according to lehmann , weimar 's graphic art collection is one example of a jeopardized cultural good .
" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .
" these are all things that deeply disturb us . "
he said that authorities had become more sensitive since the fire in the 18th century anna amalia library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many works destroyed in the library 's famous rococo room the blaze destroyed 50,000 precious and mostly irreplaceable volumes and badly damaged a further 60,000 .
the total estimated damage amounted to some 67 million euros -lrb- $ 81.7 million -rrb- .
the library 's centerpiece , the famous rococo room , was also destroyed .
weimar 's fortunes are slumping weimar is known to tourists around the world as a picture-perfect town .
the cradle of german classicism - once the home of goethe and schiller - has played host to some of the greatest european artists and intellectuals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city 's most famous citizens : goethe und schiller after german unification , the government and the european union pumped millions of euros into the city to restore its former splendor .
weimar got another boost when it was named eu cultural capital in 1999 .
the town hosted an ambitious cultural program and drew many visitors .
but when it was over , weimar 's fortunes slumped again .
no glossing over the facts the blaze in the anna amalia library was started by a cable fire .
now , experts fear the same could happen elsewhere in weimar - for example in the city castle , and in particular the rooms that house the collection of prints and drawings .
the commission was highly critical of conditions there .
hellmut seemann , swkk 's president , said the findings were " devastating . "
" but it is an accurate assessment of the situation and there 's no way we can gloss over the fact , " said seemann .
" conditions in the museum are catastrophic . "
weimar needs to wake up in response to the commission 's report , the government has thrown weimar a life line of fresh cash .
due to this additional funding , the foundation was able to improve the situation in the summer months - at least provisionally .
some of the funds are earmarked for the preservation of goethe 's drawings , of which only a third have been restored so far .
but experts say merely saving what is there is not enough .
the town needs to wake up to its responsibilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the great-granddaughter of famous composer richard wagner " weimar always needs fresh wind , " said nike wagner , head of weimar 's arts festival .
" weimar has an unhealthy tradition of rejecting whatever is new and modern . "
it had snubbed the art nouveau and bauhaus movements , for example .
" the people of weimar have always tried to exclude whatever is modern , and remain fixated on images of classicism , " said wagner .
weimar needs a vision another problem is the contemporary art collection in the " new museum . "
fewer than 5,000 visitors came last year .
the modern works seem neglected and unloved , compared to the treasures of earlier centuries .
renowned art collector paul maenz had loaned the museum many important works .
now , he wants the works back .
it 's a slap in the face for weimar and those in charge of its arts policy .
" nostalgia for the past is not enough , " said lehmann .
" in order to define one 's place in today 's world , one needs vision , one needs to explore new approaches .
i think people failed to grasp what it meant for mr. maenz to loan his collection to the neues museum . "
saving weimar 's legacy the commission said a proper visitors center should be created in the city castle , the schloss .
the experts also want to build a central storage facility for weimar 's art treasures .
the city , they said , must shape up for the 21st century .
" i will take great pains to ensure that everyone , apart from the public who can always say ' it 's all rubbish , ' who shares responsibility for this foundation furthers these goals , " said seemann .
the government has earmarked 10 million euros in emergency funds for weimar .
many believe it 's the city 's last chance to save its legacy as the home of germany 's cultural titans . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the sorrows of young schiller german icon friedrich schiller died 200 years ago in may - an anniversary marked in weimar with the opening of a special " schiller year .

germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .
but the walk up is not the only thing that is steep , with prices for the smallest of the houses starting at 160 euros -lrb- $ 191 -rrb- including breakfast .
buffalo bill in the trees bergmann , who bears a resemblance to buffalo bill and likes to go by the name king bergamo , brushed aside remarks that the lodgings are rather rustic for the three-star prices .
" we offer more than lodgings , we offer an experience , " he said . other innovations offered at the complex , a three-hour drive south from berlin , include a night in an indian teepee and a stay in an underground dwelling set in an artificial cave .
at its door , a giant " cannibal cauldron " - a mammoth cast-iron pot over a bonfire - awaits guests eager for a bath . king bergamo does not see his competition among traditional hotels and is quick to point to the problems of a holiday in the treetops . " everything is cramped , it 's not comfortable , " he said .
" after the third night you start to only see the downsides , " which is when he says it is time to go back to civilization .
" it would be a shame to leave with a bad impression . " in the years following german reunification the site was a prototype playground used as a showroom for bergmann 's carpentry business .
today the park and the company employ some 50 people , in a depressed corner of eastern germany where one in four is out of a job . bergmann can not yet survive on the income from his adventure park alone but makes a living from fantasy constructions with orders pouring in from across europe .

mismanagement has made things go very wrong in the cradle of german classicism , weimar . the devastating fire that gutted the anna amalia library in weimar last september destroyed a jewel in the town 's cultural crown .
but a recent report has found that many other landmarks in the eastern german city are endangered .
a commission set up by the prussian cultural heritage foundation -lrb- spk -rrb- examined the state of weimar 's cultural affairs .
it has now accused the foundation created to preserve and manage the town 's cultural heritage , stiftung weimarer klassik -lrb- swkk -rrb- , of serious mismanagement .
and it warns that weimar 's treasures are under threat .
" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .
results are deeply disturbing according to lehmann , weimar 's graphic art collection is one example of a jeopardized cultural good .
" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .
" these are all things that deeply disturb us . "
he said that authorities had become more sensitive since the fire in the 18th century anna amalia library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many works destroyed in the library 's famous rococo room the blaze destroyed 50,000 precious and mostly irreplaceable volumes and badly damaged a further 60,000 .
the total estimated damage amounted to some 67 million euros -lrb- $ 81.7 million -rrb- .
the library 's centerpiece , the famous rococo room , was also destroyed .
weimar 's fortunes are slumping weimar is known to tourists around the world as a picture-perfect town .
the cradle of german classicism - once the home of goethe and schiller - has played host to some of the greatest european artists and intellectuals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city 's most famous citizens : goethe und schiller after german unification , the government and the european union pumped millions of euros into the city to restore its former splendor .
weimar got another boost when it was named eu cultural capital in 1999 .
the town hosted an ambitious cultural program and drew many visitors .
but when it was over , weimar 's fortunes slumped again .
no glossing over the facts the blaze in the anna amalia library was started by a cable fire .
now , experts fear the same could happen elsewhere in weimar - for example in the city castle , and in particular the rooms that house the collection of prints and drawings .
the commission was highly critical of conditions there .
hellmut seemann , swkk 's president , said the findings were " devastating . "
" but it is an accurate assessment of the situation and there 's no way we can gloss over the fact , " said seemann .
" conditions in the museum are catastrophic . "
weimar needs to wake up in response to the commission 's report , the government has thrown weimar a life line of fresh cash .
due to this additional funding , the foundation was able to improve the situation in the summer months - at least provisionally .
some of the funds are earmarked for the preservation of goethe 's drawings , of which only a third have been restored so far .
but experts say merely saving what is there is not enough .
the town needs to wake up to its responsibilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the great-granddaughter of famous composer richard wagner " weimar always needs fresh wind , " said nike wagner , head of weimar 's arts festival .
" weimar has an unhealthy tradition of rejecting whatever is new and modern . "
it had snubbed the art nouveau and bauhaus movements , for example .
" the people of weimar have always tried to exclude whatever is modern , and remain fixated on images of classicism , " said wagner .
weimar needs a vision another problem is the contemporary art collection in the " new museum . "
fewer than 5,000 visitors came last year .
the modern works seem neglected and unloved , compared to the treasures of earlier centuries .
renowned art collector paul maenz had loaned the museum many important works .
now , he wants the works back .
it 's a slap in the face for weimar and those in charge of its arts policy .
" nostalgia for the past is not enough , " said lehmann .
" in order to define one 's place in today 's world , one needs vision , one needs to explore new approaches .
i think people failed to grasp what it meant for mr. maenz to loan his collection to the neues museum . "
saving weimar 's legacy the commission said a proper visitors center should be created in the city castle , the schloss .
the experts also want to build a central storage facility for weimar 's art treasures .
the city , they said , must shape up for the 21st century .
" i will take great pains to ensure that everyone , apart from the public who can always say ' it 's all rubbish , ' who shares responsibility for this foundation furthers these goals , " said seemann .
the government has earmarked 10 million euros in emergency funds for weimar .

germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .
but the walk up is not the only thing that is steep , with prices for the smallest of the houses starting at 160 euros -lrb- $ 191 -rrb- including breakfast .
buffalo bill in the trees bergmann , who bears a resemblance to buffalo bill and likes to go by the name king bergamo , brushed aside remarks that the lodgings are rather rustic for the three-star prices .
" we offer more than lodgings , we offer an experience , " he said . other innovations offered at the complex , a three-hour drive south from berlin , include a night in an indian teepee and a stay in an underground dwelling set in an artificial cave .
at its door , a giant " cannibal cauldron " - a mammoth cast-iron pot over a bonfire - awaits guests eager for a bath . king bergamo does not see his competition among traditional hotels and is quick to point to the problems of a holiday in the treetops . " everything is cramped , it 's not comfortable , " he said .
" after the third night you start to only see the downsides , " which is when he says it is time to go back to civilization .
" it would be a shame to leave with a bad impression . " in the years following german reunification the site was a prototype playground used as a showroom for bergmann 's carpentry business .
today the park and the company employ some 50 people , in a depressed corner of eastern germany where one in four is out of a job . bergmann can not yet survive on the income from his adventure park alone but makes a living from fantasy constructions with orders pouring in from across europe .
elaborate playgrounds for malaga in spain and the belgian town of lilse bergen , robin hood huts for england 's sherwood forest in nottingham and a tropical house for the vienna 's schönbrunn park are all in the works . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .

germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .
but the walk up is not the only thing that is steep , with prices for the smallest of the houses starting at 160 euros -lrb- $ 191 -rrb- including breakfast .
buffalo bill in the trees bergmann , who bears a resemblance to buffalo bill and likes to go by the name king bergamo , brushed aside remarks that the lodgings are rather rustic for the three-star prices .
" we offer more than lodgings , we offer an experience , " he said . other innovations offered at the complex , a three-hour drive south from berlin , include a night in an indian teepee and a stay in an underground dwelling set in an artificial cave .
at its door , a giant " cannibal cauldron " - a mammoth cast-iron pot over a bonfire - awaits guests eager for a bath . king bergamo does not see his competition among traditional hotels and is quick to point to the problems of a holiday in the treetops . " everything is cramped , it 's not comfortable , " he said .
" after the third night you start to only see the downsides , " which is when he says it is time to go back to civilization .
" it would be a shame to leave with a bad impression . " in the years following german reunification the site was a prototype playground used as a showroom for bergmann 's carpentry business .
today the park and the company employ some 50 people , in a depressed corner of eastern germany where one in four is out of a job . bergmann can not yet survive on the income from his adventure park alone but makes a living from fantasy constructions with orders pouring in from across europe .
elaborate playgrounds for malaga in spain and the belgian town of lilse bergen , robin hood huts for england 's sherwood forest in nottingham and a tropical house for the vienna 's schönbrunn park are all in the works . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .

mismanagement has made things go very wrong in the cradle of german classicism , weimar . the devastating fire that gutted the anna amalia library in weimar last september destroyed a jewel in the town 's cultural crown .
but a recent report has found that many other landmarks in the eastern german city are endangered .
a commission set up by the prussian cultural heritage foundation -lrb- spk -rrb- examined the state of weimar 's cultural affairs .
it has now accused the foundation created to preserve and manage the town 's cultural heritage , stiftung weimarer klassik -lrb- swkk -rrb- , of serious mismanagement .
and it warns that weimar 's treasures are under threat .
" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .
results are deeply disturbing according to lehmann , weimar 's graphic art collection is one example of a jeopardized cultural good .
" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .
" these are all things that deeply disturb us . "
he said that authorities had become more sensitive since the fire in the 18th century anna amalia library .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the many works destroyed in the library 's famous rococo room the blaze destroyed 50,000 precious and mostly irreplaceable volumes and badly damaged a further 60,000 .
the total estimated damage amounted to some 67 million euros -lrb- $ 81.7 million -rrb- .
the library 's centerpiece , the famous rococo room , was also destroyed .
weimar 's fortunes are slumping weimar is known to tourists around the world as a picture-perfect town .
the cradle of german classicism - once the home of goethe and schiller - has played host to some of the greatest european artists and intellectuals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city 's most famous citizens : goethe und schiller after german unification , the government and the european union pumped millions of euros into the city to restore its former splendor .
weimar got another boost when it was named eu cultural capital in 1999 .
the town hosted an ambitious cultural program and drew many visitors .
but when it was over , weimar 's fortunes slumped again .
no glossing over the facts the blaze in the anna amalia library was started by a cable fire .
now , experts fear the same could happen elsewhere in weimar - for example in the city castle , and in particular the rooms that house the collection of prints and drawings .
the commission was highly critical of conditions there .
hellmut seemann , swkk 's president , said the findings were " devastating . "
" but it is an accurate assessment of the situation and there 's no way we can gloss over the fact , " said seemann .
" conditions in the museum are catastrophic . "
weimar needs to wake up in response to the commission 's report , the government has thrown weimar a life line of fresh cash .
due to this additional funding , the foundation was able to improve the situation in the summer months - at least provisionally .
some of the funds are earmarked for the preservation of goethe 's drawings , of which only a third have been restored so far .
but experts say merely saving what is there is not enough .
the town needs to wake up to its responsibilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the great-granddaughter of famous composer richard wagner " weimar always needs fresh wind , " said nike wagner , head of weimar 's arts festival .
" weimar has an unhealthy tradition of rejecting whatever is new and modern . "
it had snubbed the art nouveau and bauhaus movements , for example .
" the people of weimar have always tried to exclude whatever is modern , and remain fixated on images of classicism , " said wagner .
weimar needs a vision another problem is the contemporary art collection in the " new museum . "
fewer than 5,000 visitors came last year .
the modern works seem neglected and unloved , compared to the treasures of earlier centuries .
renowned art collector paul maenz had loaned the museum many important works .
now , he wants the works back .
it 's a slap in the face for weimar and those in charge of its arts policy .
" nostalgia for the past is not enough , " said lehmann .
" in order to define one 's place in today 's world , one needs vision , one needs to explore new approaches .
i think people failed to grasp what it meant for mr. maenz to loan his collection to the neues museum . "
saving weimar 's legacy the commission said a proper visitors center should be created in the city castle , the schloss .
the experts also want to build a central storage facility for weimar 's art treasures .
the city , they said , must shape up for the 21st century .
" i will take great pains to ensure that everyone , apart from the public who can always say ' it 's all rubbish , ' who shares responsibility for this foundation furthers these goals , " said seemann .
the government has earmarked 10 million euros in emergency funds for weimar .

germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true .

mismanagement has made things go very wrong in the cradle of german classicism , weimar . the devastating fire that gutted the anna amalia library in weimar last september destroyed a jewel in the town 's cultural crown .
but a recent report has found that many other landmarks in the eastern german city are endangered .
a commission set up by the prussian cultural heritage foundation -lrb- spk -rrb- examined the state of weimar 's cultural affairs .
it has now accused the foundation created to preserve and manage the town 's cultural heritage , stiftung weimarer klassik -lrb- swkk -rrb- , of serious mismanagement .
and it warns that weimar 's treasures are under threat .
" there is reason to believe that works are in serious danger in a number of facilities , " said spk president klaus-dieter lehmann , who headed the inquiry .
results are deeply disturbing according to lehmann , weimar 's graphic art collection is one example of a jeopardized cultural good .
" goethe 's drawings are still mounted on acidic cardboard , which means there is a real risk of damage and deterioration , " said lehmann .

no glossing over the facts the blaze in the anna amalia library was started by a cable fire .

weimar needs a vision another problem is the contemporary art collection in the " new museum . "
fewer than 5,000 visitors came last year .
the modern works seem neglected and unloved , compared to the treasures of earlier centuries .
renowned art collector paul maenz had loaned the museum many important works .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike wagner is the great-granddaughter of famous composer richard wagner " weimar always needs fresh wind , " said nike wagner , head of weimar 's arts festival .
" weimar has an unhealthy tradition of rejecting whatever is new and modern . "
it had snubbed the art nouveau and bauhaus movements , for example .
" the people of weimar have always tried to exclude whatever is modern , and remain fixated on images of classicism , " said wagner .
weimar needs a vision another problem is the contemporary art collection in the " new museum . "
fewer than 5,000 visitors came last year .
the modern works seem neglected and unloved , compared to the treasures of earlier centuries .
renowned art collector paul maenz had loaned the museum many important works .
now , he wants the works back .
it 's a slap in the face for weimar and those in charge of its arts policy .
" nostalgia for the past is not enough , " said lehmann .
" in order to define one 's place in today 's world , one needs vision , one needs to explore new approaches .
i think people failed to grasp what it meant for mr. maenz to loan his collection to the neues museum . "
saving weimar 's legacy the commission said a proper visitors center should be created in the city castle , the schloss .
the experts also want to build a central storage facility for weimar 's art treasures .
the city , they said , must shape up for the 21st century .
" i will take great pains to ensure that everyone , apart from the public who can always say ' it 's all rubbish , ' who shares responsibility for this foundation furthers these goals , " said seemann .
the government has earmarked 10 million euros in emergency funds for weimar .

germans , ever intrepid tourists , have discovered a new twist on the theme - tree houses for grown-ups . the five cabins are each perched on branches and reinforced with giant stilts , offering a bird 's eye view of the lush forest in zentendorf , saxony , on the polish frontier .
each has two or three floors connected by ladders and is capable of housing up to four people .
the lodgings are a child 's dream come true . " our tree houses are built like kids would have made them if we had let them , " said manager jürgen bergmann , stroking his grey goatee . the tree houses are built without right-angles to create a more organic feel and interlinked with wooden footbridges .
bergmann assures the gravity-defying constructions are fully compliant with germany 's strict safety regulations . equipped with chemical toilets and shared shower cabins , the tree houses allow a wash at an elevation of 10 meters -lrb- about 30 feet -rrb- , with a spectacular view of the deep woods and the neisse river . the first guests arrived last month and bergmann has received more than 150 bookings so far .
but the walk up is not the only thing that is steep , with prices for the smallest of the houses starting at 160 euros -lrb- $ 191 -rrb- including breakfast .
buffalo bill in the trees bergmann , who bears a resemblance to buffalo bill and likes to go by the name king bergamo , brushed aside remarks that the lodgings are rather rustic for the three-star prices .
" we offer more than lodgings , we offer an experience , " he said . other innovations offered at the complex , a three-hour drive south from berlin , include a night in an indian teepee and a stay in an underground dwelling set in an artificial cave .
at its door , a giant " cannibal cauldron " - a mammoth cast-iron pot over a bonfire - awaits guests eager for a bath . king bergamo does not see his competition among traditional hotels and is quick to point to the problems of a holiday in the treetops . " everything is cramped , it 's not comfortable , " he said .
" after the third night you start to only see the downsides , " which is when he says it is time to go back to civilization .
" it would be a shame to leave with a bad impression . " in the years following german reunification the site was a prototype playground used as a showroom for bergmann 's carpentry business .
today the park and the company employ some 50 people , in a depressed corner of eastern germany where one in four is out of a job . bergmann can not yet survive on the income from his adventure park alone but makes a living from fantasy constructions with orders pouring in from across europe .
elaborate playgrounds for malaga in spain and the belgian town of lilse bergen , robin hood huts for england 's sherwood forest in nottingham and a tropical house for the vienna 's schönbrunn park are all in the works . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .
