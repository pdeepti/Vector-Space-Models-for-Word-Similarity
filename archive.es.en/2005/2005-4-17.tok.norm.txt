the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .
the business for euro coins is so lucrative that andorra , the tiny state tucked in between spain and france , has petitioned brussels to mint its own coins . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ? the german capital may be one of the liveliest cities in the world , but apparently , plenty of its citizens do n't even want to get out of bed in the morning . according to a 2005 health survey published this week by dak , a german health insurer , the number of people diagnosed with depression in berlin has risen 70 percent since 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study of 90,000 working berliners revealed that while 10 percent fewer people took sick leave from work in the past year , some 12 percent of those who stayed home did so because they were suffering from depression and panic attacks .
mental problems are therefore the top reason for absence from work , well ahead of other health issues . urban anxiety berlin registered more cases of sick leave for psychological reasons than any other state in germany , with the residents of hamburg and bremen limping in close behind . one reason could be that germany is still malingering in the shadow of fiscal gloom .

is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ? the german capital may be one of the liveliest cities in the world , but apparently , plenty of its citizens do n't even want to get out of bed in the morning . according to a 2005 health survey published this week by dak , a german health insurer , the number of people diagnosed with depression in berlin has risen 70 percent since 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study of 90,000 working berliners revealed that while 10 percent fewer people took sick leave from work in the past year , some 12 percent of those who stayed home did so because they were suffering from depression and panic attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.04.2005 g7 vows to tackle imbalances , splits on aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf 's rodrigo de rato , right , had sharp words about imbalances finance heads from the world 's seven leading economic powers said on saturday they would pursue " vigorous " action to reduce global imbalances , but remained divided on how to free poor countries from debt and poverty . during the meeting , finance ministers have received a sharp warning from the head of the international monetary fund , who said their policies could disrupt world markets .
the warning from international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- managing director rodrigo rato on saturday followed a twice-yearly meeting here of the imf policy-making committee , made up of senior finance chiefs from around the world .
earlier in the day finance ministers and central bankers from the powerful group of seven industrialized countries issued an upbeat statement on global prospects , predicting " solid growth for 2005 " despite higher oil prices and an uneven pace of activity across several regions . " since our meeting in february the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005 , " ministers said in a statement issued after the weekend talks in washington . but the group of seven - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - failed to find common ground on debt relief for the world 's most impoverished nations , a failure that anti-poverty campaigners said would result in the deaths of millions more children . not so rosy rato dampened the optimism in the g7 statement with unusually pointed remarks aimed at some of the planet 's most influential economic players .
he said the global financial system was now out of kilter because of the huge us current account deficit , weak growth in europe and japan , the low savings rate of us consumers and inflexible currency regimes in asia . " if policies do not adapt , do not change to react to these imbalances , we run the risk of an abrupt correction of the markets ... -lrb- when -rrb- confidence for different reasons could evaporate or could be reduced , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's finance minister sadakazu tanigaki , right , and bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui , left , listen to translation of speeches at the start of the g7 meeting .
rato in addition cited the " need for asian countries to have more flexible exchange rates " after the g7 implicitly called on china to relax its yuan-dollar currency peg .
china 's policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar has been harshly criticized by the us , which considers it tantamount to a government subsidy to the rising power 's already highly competitive exporters . deficits or slow growth to blame ? the imf head has not been alone in sounding the alarm about the persistent deficit in the us current account , a broad measure of trade in goods and services as well as certain financial transfers . the current account shortfall unnerves rato and other economists because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , left , and european central bank president , jean-claude trichet at the g7 meeting .
us treasury secretary john snow has acknowledged that washington needs to shrink its current account deficit but maintains that much of the problem lies with weakness in europe and japan , which prevents consumers there from buying us goods . that argument was rejected by a senior french official last week who said france in fact enjoys strong domestic demand and suggested that washington was trying to shift the blame . no breakthrough on debt despite any sign of concrete headway , g7 ministers meanwhile claimed progress towards their goal of erasing an $ 80 billion multilateral debt burden that sees more money go to interest repayments than to health or education in the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britains chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , left .
" it 's now recognised , i think for the first time from these meetings , that more money has to be made available , " british finance minister gordon brown , the g7 's current chairman , told a news conference .
brown has made debt relief for developing countries one of his priorities . " what we must now do is get the international agreement on sums of money and we believe that that will come at gleneagles , " he said in reference to a group of eight - the g7 plus russia - summit in scotland in july . the g7 ministers made no mention of a brown-inspired proposal under which the imf would sell a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed it by poor countries .
the imf says such a sale is technically feasible but the united states fears that offloading the reserves , which at current rates are worth 45 billion dollars , would destabilise the markets . besides the possible selling of imf gold , other options to finance debt relief include a proposal by france and germany to levy a global tax on airline tickets and jet fuel .
german finance minister hans eichel said the proposal would be " very easy to put into place . "
he added , however , that he " regretted the absence of political commitment " of g7 partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kendra sudano , left , and lia gillis , right , both of washington , hold up signs outside of the treasury department , in background , protesting the g7 meeting .
campaigners berated the g7 bickering .
they said another two million children younger than five would die before the gleneagles summit in july from disease and malnutrition brought about by extreme poverty .
" they say they have the will , we all know the way , but once more the g7 have chosen delay , " said jonathan hepburn , policy adviser for oxfam international .

the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .

the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "

the warning from international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- managing director rodrigo rato on saturday followed a twice-yearly meeting here of the imf policy-making committee , made up of senior finance chiefs from around the world .
earlier in the day finance ministers and central bankers from the powerful group of seven industrialized countries issued an upbeat statement on global prospects , predicting " solid growth for 2005 " despite higher oil prices and an uneven pace of activity across several regions . " since our meeting in february the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005 , " ministers said in a statement issued after the weekend talks in washington . but the group of seven - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - failed to find common ground on debt relief for the world 's most impoverished nations , a failure that anti-poverty campaigners said would result in the deaths of millions more children . not so rosy rato dampened the optimism in the g7 statement with unusually pointed remarks aimed at some of the planet 's most influential economic players .
he said the global financial system was now out of kilter because of the huge us current account deficit , weak growth in europe and japan , the low savings rate of us consumers and inflexible currency regimes in asia . " if policies do not adapt , do not change to react to these imbalances , we run the risk of an abrupt correction of the markets ... -lrb- when -rrb- confidence for different reasons could evaporate or could be reduced , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's finance minister sadakazu tanigaki , right , and bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui , left , listen to translation of speeches at the start of the g7 meeting .
rato in addition cited the " need for asian countries to have more flexible exchange rates " after the g7 implicitly called on china to relax its yuan-dollar currency peg .
china 's policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar has been harshly criticized by the us , which considers it tantamount to a government subsidy to the rising power 's already highly competitive exporters . deficits or slow growth to blame ? the imf head has not been alone in sounding the alarm about the persistent deficit in the us current account , a broad measure of trade in goods and services as well as certain financial transfers . the current account shortfall unnerves rato and other economists because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , left , and european central bank president , jean-claude trichet at the g7 meeting .
us treasury secretary john snow has acknowledged that washington needs to shrink its current account deficit but maintains that much of the problem lies with weakness in europe and japan , which prevents consumers there from buying us goods . that argument was rejected by a senior french official last week who said france in fact enjoys strong domestic demand and suggested that washington was trying to shift the blame . no breakthrough on debt despite any sign of concrete headway , g7 ministers meanwhile claimed progress towards their goal of erasing an $ 80 billion multilateral debt burden that sees more money go to interest repayments than to health or education in the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britains chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , left .
" it 's now recognised , i think for the first time from these meetings , that more money has to be made available , " british finance minister gordon brown , the g7 's current chairman , told a news conference .
brown has made debt relief for developing countries one of his priorities . " what we must now do is get the international agreement on sums of money and we believe that that will come at gleneagles , " he said in reference to a group of eight - the g7 plus russia - summit in scotland in july . the g7 ministers made no mention of a brown-inspired proposal under which the imf would sell a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed it by poor countries .
the imf says such a sale is technically feasible but the united states fears that offloading the reserves , which at current rates are worth 45 billion dollars , would destabilise the markets . besides the possible selling of imf gold , other options to finance debt relief include a proposal by france and germany to levy a global tax on airline tickets and jet fuel .
german finance minister hans eichel said the proposal would be " very easy to put into place . "
he added , however , that he " regretted the absence of political commitment " of g7 partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kendra sudano , left , and lia gillis , right , both of washington , hold up signs outside of the treasury department , in background , protesting the g7 meeting .
campaigners berated the g7 bickering .
they said another two million children younger than five would die before the gleneagles summit in july from disease and malnutrition brought about by extreme poverty .

the warning from international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- managing director rodrigo rato on saturday followed a twice-yearly meeting here of the imf policy-making committee , made up of senior finance chiefs from around the world .
earlier in the day finance ministers and central bankers from the powerful group of seven industrialized countries issued an upbeat statement on global prospects , predicting " solid growth for 2005 " despite higher oil prices and an uneven pace of activity across several regions . " since our meeting in february the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005 , " ministers said in a statement issued after the weekend talks in washington . but the group of seven - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - failed to find common ground on debt relief for the world 's most impoverished nations , a failure that anti-poverty campaigners said would result in the deaths of millions more children . not so rosy rato dampened the optimism in the g7 statement with unusually pointed remarks aimed at some of the planet 's most influential economic players .
he said the global financial system was now out of kilter because of the huge us current account deficit , weak growth in europe and japan , the low savings rate of us consumers and inflexible currency regimes in asia . " if policies do not adapt , do not change to react to these imbalances , we run the risk of an abrupt correction of the markets ... -lrb- when -rrb- confidence for different reasons could evaporate or could be reduced , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's finance minister sadakazu tanigaki , right , and bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui , left , listen to translation of speeches at the start of the g7 meeting .
rato in addition cited the " need for asian countries to have more flexible exchange rates " after the g7 implicitly called on china to relax its yuan-dollar currency peg .
china 's policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar has been harshly criticized by the us , which considers it tantamount to a government subsidy to the rising power 's already highly competitive exporters . deficits or slow growth to blame ? the imf head has not been alone in sounding the alarm about the persistent deficit in the us current account , a broad measure of trade in goods and services as well as certain financial transfers . the current account shortfall unnerves rato and other economists because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .

" it 's now recognised , i think for the first time from these meetings , that more money has to be made available , " british finance minister gordon brown , the g7 's current chairman , told a news conference .
brown has made debt relief for developing countries one of his priorities . " what we must now do is get the international agreement on sums of money and we believe that that will come at gleneagles , " he said in reference to a group of eight - the g7 plus russia - summit in scotland in july . the g7 ministers made no mention of a brown-inspired proposal under which the imf would sell a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed it by poor countries .
the imf says such a sale is technically feasible but the united states fears that offloading the reserves , which at current rates are worth 45 billion dollars , would destabilise the markets . besides the possible selling of imf gold , other options to finance debt relief include a proposal by france and germany to levy a global tax on airline tickets and jet fuel .

environment minister trittin presents green goal in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .
to limit the strain on the environment , the organizing committee has announced the green goal campaign . the green goal environmental initiative should make the world cup the most environmentally ' neutral ' event of its caliber ever .
now , to mark the launch of the campaign , green goal has its own web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the introduction of the green goal initiative , the world cup takes on new meaning " we have committed to comprehensive , measurable environmental targets at a decentralized , large-scale sporting event for the very first time , " german environment minister jürgen trittin said at a ceremony to activate the green goal internet site at the berlin olympic stadium .
" we always knew the biggest challenge from an environmental point of view would be organizing transportation , especially given the decentralized nature of the event .
i 'm delighted the oc has already laid down important markers . "
getting the million of visitors to the stadiums presents a massive challenge for the organizing committee .
for the up to 15,000 journalists expected , there will be one big advantage - they will be able to use the transportation systems for free .
" during the six weeks of the world cup , journalists will be able to use the inter-city and local networks of the german railways throughout the country , " trittin announced .
stadiums lie at the heart of the initiative green goal 's target is to reduce the event 's impact on the global climate .
to do this , the initiative covers five core areas : water , refuse , energy , mobility and " climate neutrality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will be going primarily with public transportation to the stadiums , here berlin 's olympic stadium the 12 stadiums throughout germany are at the heart of the campaign .
up to a fifth of the water needed will be regained from surface , rain and spring water .
spectators for the most part will use public transportation to get to the stadiums .
and soccer enthusiasts from outside of germany will be introduced to the national pastime of separating garbage into plastic , paper , glass and other .
climate neutrality ' climate neutral ' is a critical catch phrase for the world cup 2006 .
up to 100,000 extra tons of greenhouse gases are likely to be generated and the organizing committee has struck an agreement with fifa to neutralize the negative effects .
" insofar as it is possible , we want to reduce overall energy consumption and use eco-friendly energy , " commented oc vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" the emissions which will still inevitably arise will be cancelled out by climate protection projects in other places .
together with all parties involved , our aim is to contribute towards a lasting legacy from the 2006 fifa world cup . "
environmental projects served bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims of the dec .
26 tsunami disaster are supposed to benefit from the green goal initiative a zero-sum greenhouse gas competition is the goal , though that 's unrealistic .
to compensate , the oc and its partners will invest in climate protection schemes elsewhere .
one million euros -lrb- $ 1.29 million -rrb- are already available for this .
" projects will be chosen in certain countries , most importantly in those areas hit by the tsunami and in south africa , that satisfy the greatest demands of environmental groups , " said christian hochfeld from the ecological institute that helped develop the campaign .

climate neutrality ' climate neutral ' is a critical catch phrase for the world cup 2006 .

" insofar as it is possible , we want to reduce overall energy consumption and use eco-friendly energy , " commented oc vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" the emissions which will still inevitably arise will be cancelled out by climate protection projects in other places .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 17.04.2005 mini-state euros demanding big prices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a euro is not just worth a euro when it depicts john paul ii the deaths of pope john paul ii and monaco 's prince rainier have been a boon for coin collectors .
the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .
the business for euro coins is so lucrative that andorra , the tiny state tucked in between spain and france , has petitioned brussels to mint its own coins . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

mental problems are therefore the top reason for absence from work , well ahead of other health issues . urban anxiety berlin registered more cases of sick leave for psychological reasons than any other state in germany , with the residents of hamburg and bremen limping in close behind . one reason could be that germany is still malingering in the shadow of fiscal gloom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.04.2005 berliners get the blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trials of modern life are too much for some a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ? the german capital may be one of the liveliest cities in the world , but apparently , plenty of its citizens do n't even want to get out of bed in the morning . according to a 2005 health survey published this week by dak , a german health insurer , the number of people diagnosed with depression in berlin has risen 70 percent since 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study of 90,000 working berliners revealed that while 10 percent fewer people took sick leave from work in the past year , some 12 percent of those who stayed home did so because they were suffering from depression and panic attacks .
mental problems are therefore the top reason for absence from work , well ahead of other health issues . urban anxiety berlin registered more cases of sick leave for psychological reasons than any other state in germany , with the residents of hamburg and bremen limping in close behind . one reason could be that germany is still malingering in the shadow of fiscal gloom . " in times of economic insecurity , young people in particular tend to develop psychological problems in response to professional and private obstacles , " explained dak ceo herbert rebscher . surprisingly , however , psychological difficulties seem to be less of a burden in the struggling eastern states . a nation of cry-babies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so why are so many berliners so down-in-the-mouth ?
maybe they 're just the only ones admitting how bad they feel .
therapy and mental illness are far less of a taboo in liberal , anonymous urban environments than in small towns and rural areas .
because treatment is far more widely available in cities , more people are willing to seek help , thereby boosting the statistics . according to the dak report , 70 percent of germans say they would turn to the professionals for advice and support with psychological problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but hans-dieter nolting from the institute for health and social research suspects that germans have simply become more sensitive .
at the same time , public pressure to get ahead makes it harder to nip emerging problems in the bud . who can afford to call in sick just because they 're feeling a bit weepy ? the cut-throat modern world in a similar vein , rebscher cited " the transformation of the modern working world " as a key factor . the high-octane climate of contemporary life is taking its toll , he says . in a nation of 5 million unemployed , performance anxiety , fear of failure , rivalry , the threat of layoffs and bullying in the workplace can all contribute to a sense of helplessness and despair . young people are particularly prone to melancholy .
psychological problems in men between 25 and 29 and women between 20 and 24 have doubled .
women are more likely to seek help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might not have to work anymore , but the elderly are n't exactly jumping with joy either .
one in three pensioners say they suffer from one or another form of psychological illness .
ten years ago , only 18 percent admitted to feeling blue . even so , most germans would rather be employed and depressed than unemployed and happy .
it 's a vicious circle .
" how will someone ever get better , " wondered burghard klopp , a depression expert at berlin 's charité hospital , " when they know their boss is just waiting to fire them ?

the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .
the business for euro coins is so lucrative that andorra , the tiny state tucked in between spain and france , has petitioned brussels to mint its own coins . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

environment minister trittin presents green goal in just over 13 months , millions of soccer fans will descend on germany for the world cup .
to limit the strain on the environment , the organizing committee has announced the green goal campaign . the green goal environmental initiative should make the world cup the most environmentally ' neutral ' event of its caliber ever .
now , to mark the launch of the campaign , green goal has its own web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the introduction of the green goal initiative , the world cup takes on new meaning " we have committed to comprehensive , measurable environmental targets at a decentralized , large-scale sporting event for the very first time , " german environment minister jürgen trittin said at a ceremony to activate the green goal internet site at the berlin olympic stadium .
" we always knew the biggest challenge from an environmental point of view would be organizing transportation , especially given the decentralized nature of the event .
i 'm delighted the oc has already laid down important markers . "
getting the million of visitors to the stadiums presents a massive challenge for the organizing committee .
for the up to 15,000 journalists expected , there will be one big advantage - they will be able to use the transportation systems for free .
" during the six weeks of the world cup , journalists will be able to use the inter-city and local networks of the german railways throughout the country , " trittin announced .
stadiums lie at the heart of the initiative green goal 's target is to reduce the event 's impact on the global climate .
to do this , the initiative covers five core areas : water , refuse , energy , mobility and " climate neutrality . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans will be going primarily with public transportation to the stadiums , here berlin 's olympic stadium the 12 stadiums throughout germany are at the heart of the campaign .
up to a fifth of the water needed will be regained from surface , rain and spring water .
spectators for the most part will use public transportation to get to the stadiums .
and soccer enthusiasts from outside of germany will be introduced to the national pastime of separating garbage into plastic , paper , glass and other .
climate neutrality ' climate neutral ' is a critical catch phrase for the world cup 2006 .
up to 100,000 extra tons of greenhouse gases are likely to be generated and the organizing committee has struck an agreement with fifa to neutralize the negative effects .
" insofar as it is possible , we want to reduce overall energy consumption and use eco-friendly energy , " commented oc vice-president wolfgang niersbach .
" the emissions which will still inevitably arise will be cancelled out by climate protection projects in other places .
together with all parties involved , our aim is to contribute towards a lasting legacy from the 2006 fifa world cup . "

the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .
the business for euro coins is so lucrative that andorra , the tiny state tucked in between spain and france , has petitioned brussels to mint its own coins . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .
the business for euro coins is so lucrative that andorra , the tiny state tucked in between spain and france , has petitioned brussels to mint its own coins . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

the warning from international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- managing director rodrigo rato on saturday followed a twice-yearly meeting here of the imf policy-making committee , made up of senior finance chiefs from around the world .
earlier in the day finance ministers and central bankers from the powerful group of seven industrialized countries issued an upbeat statement on global prospects , predicting " solid growth for 2005 " despite higher oil prices and an uneven pace of activity across several regions . " since our meeting in february the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005 , " ministers said in a statement issued after the weekend talks in washington . but the group of seven - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - failed to find common ground on debt relief for the world 's most impoverished nations , a failure that anti-poverty campaigners said would result in the deaths of millions more children . not so rosy rato dampened the optimism in the g7 statement with unusually pointed remarks aimed at some of the planet 's most influential economic players .
he said the global financial system was now out of kilter because of the huge us current account deficit , weak growth in europe and japan , the low savings rate of us consumers and inflexible currency regimes in asia . " if policies do not adapt , do not change to react to these imbalances , we run the risk of an abrupt correction of the markets ... -lrb- when -rrb- confidence for different reasons could evaporate or could be reduced , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's finance minister sadakazu tanigaki , right , and bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui , left , listen to translation of speeches at the start of the g7 meeting .
rato in addition cited the " need for asian countries to have more flexible exchange rates " after the g7 implicitly called on china to relax its yuan-dollar currency peg .
china 's policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar has been harshly criticized by the us , which considers it tantamount to a government subsidy to the rising power 's already highly competitive exporters . deficits or slow growth to blame ? the imf head has not been alone in sounding the alarm about the persistent deficit in the us current account , a broad measure of trade in goods and services as well as certain financial transfers . the current account shortfall unnerves rato and other economists because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , left , and european central bank president , jean-claude trichet at the g7 meeting .
us treasury secretary john snow has acknowledged that washington needs to shrink its current account deficit but maintains that much of the problem lies with weakness in europe and japan , which prevents consumers there from buying us goods . that argument was rejected by a senior french official last week who said france in fact enjoys strong domestic demand and suggested that washington was trying to shift the blame . no breakthrough on debt despite any sign of concrete headway , g7 ministers meanwhile claimed progress towards their goal of erasing an $ 80 billion multilateral debt burden that sees more money go to interest repayments than to health or education in the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britains chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , left .
" it 's now recognised , i think for the first time from these meetings , that more money has to be made available , " british finance minister gordon brown , the g7 's current chairman , told a news conference .
brown has made debt relief for developing countries one of his priorities . " what we must now do is get the international agreement on sums of money and we believe that that will come at gleneagles , " he said in reference to a group of eight - the g7 plus russia - summit in scotland in july . the g7 ministers made no mention of a brown-inspired proposal under which the imf would sell a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed it by poor countries .
the imf says such a sale is technically feasible but the united states fears that offloading the reserves , which at current rates are worth 45 billion dollars , would destabilise the markets . besides the possible selling of imf gold , other options to finance debt relief include a proposal by france and germany to levy a global tax on airline tickets and jet fuel .
german finance minister hans eichel said the proposal would be " very easy to put into place . "
he added , however , that he " regretted the absence of political commitment " of g7 partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kendra sudano , left , and lia gillis , right , both of washington , hold up signs outside of the treasury department , in background , protesting the g7 meeting .

they said another two million children younger than five would die before the gleneagles summit in july from disease and malnutrition brought about by extreme poverty .

the warning from international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- managing director rodrigo rato on saturday followed a twice-yearly meeting here of the imf policy-making committee , made up of senior finance chiefs from around the world .
earlier in the day finance ministers and central bankers from the powerful group of seven industrialized countries issued an upbeat statement on global prospects , predicting " solid growth for 2005 " despite higher oil prices and an uneven pace of activity across several regions . " since our meeting in february the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005 , " ministers said in a statement issued after the weekend talks in washington . but the group of seven - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - failed to find common ground on debt relief for the world 's most impoverished nations , a failure that anti-poverty campaigners said would result in the deaths of millions more children . not so rosy rato dampened the optimism in the g7 statement with unusually pointed remarks aimed at some of the planet 's most influential economic players .

the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .
the business for euro coins is so lucrative that andorra , the tiny state tucked in between spain and france , has petitioned brussels to mint its own coins . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.04.2005 g7 vows to tackle imbalances , splits on aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf 's rodrigo de rato , right , had sharp words about imbalances finance heads from the world 's seven leading economic powers said on saturday they would pursue " vigorous " action to reduce global imbalances , but remained divided on how to free poor countries from debt and poverty . during the meeting , finance ministers have received a sharp warning from the head of the international monetary fund , who said their policies could disrupt world markets .
the warning from international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- managing director rodrigo rato on saturday followed a twice-yearly meeting here of the imf policy-making committee , made up of senior finance chiefs from around the world .
earlier in the day finance ministers and central bankers from the powerful group of seven industrialized countries issued an upbeat statement on global prospects , predicting " solid growth for 2005 " despite higher oil prices and an uneven pace of activity across several regions . " since our meeting in february the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005 , " ministers said in a statement issued after the weekend talks in washington . but the group of seven - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - failed to find common ground on debt relief for the world 's most impoverished nations , a failure that anti-poverty campaigners said would result in the deaths of millions more children . not so rosy rato dampened the optimism in the g7 statement with unusually pointed remarks aimed at some of the planet 's most influential economic players .
he said the global financial system was now out of kilter because of the huge us current account deficit , weak growth in europe and japan , the low savings rate of us consumers and inflexible currency regimes in asia . " if policies do not adapt , do not change to react to these imbalances , we run the risk of an abrupt correction of the markets ... -lrb- when -rrb- confidence for different reasons could evaporate or could be reduced , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's finance minister sadakazu tanigaki , right , and bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui , left , listen to translation of speeches at the start of the g7 meeting .
rato in addition cited the " need for asian countries to have more flexible exchange rates " after the g7 implicitly called on china to relax its yuan-dollar currency peg .
china 's policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar has been harshly criticized by the us , which considers it tantamount to a government subsidy to the rising power 's already highly competitive exporters . deficits or slow growth to blame ? the imf head has not been alone in sounding the alarm about the persistent deficit in the us current account , a broad measure of trade in goods and services as well as certain financial transfers . the current account shortfall unnerves rato and other economists because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , left , and european central bank president , jean-claude trichet at the g7 meeting .
us treasury secretary john snow has acknowledged that washington needs to shrink its current account deficit but maintains that much of the problem lies with weakness in europe and japan , which prevents consumers there from buying us goods . that argument was rejected by a senior french official last week who said france in fact enjoys strong domestic demand and suggested that washington was trying to shift the blame . no breakthrough on debt despite any sign of concrete headway , g7 ministers meanwhile claimed progress towards their goal of erasing an $ 80 billion multilateral debt burden that sees more money go to interest repayments than to health or education in the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britains chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , left .
" it 's now recognised , i think for the first time from these meetings , that more money has to be made available , " british finance minister gordon brown , the g7 's current chairman , told a news conference .
brown has made debt relief for developing countries one of his priorities . " what we must now do is get the international agreement on sums of money and we believe that that will come at gleneagles , " he said in reference to a group of eight - the g7 plus russia - summit in scotland in july . the g7 ministers made no mention of a brown-inspired proposal under which the imf would sell a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed it by poor countries .
the imf says such a sale is technically feasible but the united states fears that offloading the reserves , which at current rates are worth 45 billion dollars , would destabilise the markets . besides the possible selling of imf gold , other options to finance debt relief include a proposal by france and germany to levy a global tax on airline tickets and jet fuel .
german finance minister hans eichel said the proposal would be " very easy to put into place . "
he added , however , that he " regretted the absence of political commitment " of g7 partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kendra sudano , left , and lia gillis , right , both of washington , hold up signs outside of the treasury department , in background , protesting the g7 meeting .
campaigners berated the g7 bickering .
they said another two million children younger than five would die before the gleneagles summit in july from disease and malnutrition brought about by extreme poverty .
" they say they have the will , we all know the way , but once more the g7 have chosen delay , " said jonathan hepburn , policy adviser for oxfam international .

the warning from international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- managing director rodrigo rato on saturday followed a twice-yearly meeting here of the imf policy-making committee , made up of senior finance chiefs from around the world .
earlier in the day finance ministers and central bankers from the powerful group of seven industrialized countries issued an upbeat statement on global prospects , predicting " solid growth for 2005 " despite higher oil prices and an uneven pace of activity across several regions . " since our meeting in february the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005 , " ministers said in a statement issued after the weekend talks in washington . but the group of seven - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - failed to find common ground on debt relief for the world 's most impoverished nations , a failure that anti-poverty campaigners said would result in the deaths of millions more children . not so rosy rato dampened the optimism in the g7 statement with unusually pointed remarks aimed at some of the planet 's most influential economic players .
he said the global financial system was now out of kilter because of the huge us current account deficit , weak growth in europe and japan , the low savings rate of us consumers and inflexible currency regimes in asia . " if policies do not adapt , do not change to react to these imbalances , we run the risk of an abrupt correction of the markets ... -lrb- when -rrb- confidence for different reasons could evaporate or could be reduced , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's finance minister sadakazu tanigaki , right , and bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui , left , listen to translation of speeches at the start of the g7 meeting .
rato in addition cited the " need for asian countries to have more flexible exchange rates " after the g7 implicitly called on china to relax its yuan-dollar currency peg .
china 's policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar has been harshly criticized by the us , which considers it tantamount to a government subsidy to the rising power 's already highly competitive exporters . deficits or slow growth to blame ? the imf head has not been alone in sounding the alarm about the persistent deficit in the us current account , a broad measure of trade in goods and services as well as certain financial transfers . the current account shortfall unnerves rato and other economists because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , left , and european central bank president , jean-claude trichet at the g7 meeting .
us treasury secretary john snow has acknowledged that washington needs to shrink its current account deficit but maintains that much of the problem lies with weakness in europe and japan , which prevents consumers there from buying us goods . that argument was rejected by a senior french official last week who said france in fact enjoys strong domestic demand and suggested that washington was trying to shift the blame . no breakthrough on debt despite any sign of concrete headway , g7 ministers meanwhile claimed progress towards their goal of erasing an $ 80 billion multilateral debt burden that sees more money go to interest repayments than to health or education in the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britains chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , left .
" it 's now recognised , i think for the first time from these meetings , that more money has to be made available , " british finance minister gordon brown , the g7 's current chairman , told a news conference .
brown has made debt relief for developing countries one of his priorities . " what we must now do is get the international agreement on sums of money and we believe that that will come at gleneagles , " he said in reference to a group of eight - the g7 plus russia - summit in scotland in july . the g7 ministers made no mention of a brown-inspired proposal under which the imf would sell a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed it by poor countries .
the imf says such a sale is technically feasible but the united states fears that offloading the reserves , which at current rates are worth 45 billion dollars , would destabilise the markets . besides the possible selling of imf gold , other options to finance debt relief include a proposal by france and germany to levy a global tax on airline tickets and jet fuel .
german finance minister hans eichel said the proposal would be " very easy to put into place . "
he added , however , that he " regretted the absence of political commitment " of g7 partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kendra sudano , left , and lia gillis , right , both of washington , hold up signs outside of the treasury department , in background , protesting the g7 meeting .
campaigners berated the g7 bickering .
they said another two million children younger than five would die before the gleneagles summit in july from disease and malnutrition brought about by extreme poverty .
" they say they have the will , we all know the way , but once more the g7 have chosen delay , " said jonathan hepburn , policy adviser for oxfam international .

the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .
the business for euro coins is so lucrative that andorra , the tiny state tucked in between spain and france , has petitioned brussels to mint its own coins . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .
the business for euro coins is so lucrative that andorra , the tiny state tucked in between spain and france , has petitioned brussels to mint its own coins . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.04.2005 g7 vows to tackle imbalances , splits on aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imf 's rodrigo de rato , right , had sharp words about imbalances finance heads from the world 's seven leading economic powers said on saturday they would pursue " vigorous " action to reduce global imbalances , but remained divided on how to free poor countries from debt and poverty . during the meeting , finance ministers have received a sharp warning from the head of the international monetary fund , who said their policies could disrupt world markets .
the warning from international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- managing director rodrigo rato on saturday followed a twice-yearly meeting here of the imf policy-making committee , made up of senior finance chiefs from around the world .
earlier in the day finance ministers and central bankers from the powerful group of seven industrialized countries issued an upbeat statement on global prospects , predicting " solid growth for 2005 " despite higher oil prices and an uneven pace of activity across several regions . " since our meeting in february the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005 , " ministers said in a statement issued after the weekend talks in washington . but the group of seven - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - failed to find common ground on debt relief for the world 's most impoverished nations , a failure that anti-poverty campaigners said would result in the deaths of millions more children . not so rosy rato dampened the optimism in the g7 statement with unusually pointed remarks aimed at some of the planet 's most influential economic players .
he said the global financial system was now out of kilter because of the huge us current account deficit , weak growth in europe and japan , the low savings rate of us consumers and inflexible currency regimes in asia . " if policies do not adapt , do not change to react to these imbalances , we run the risk of an abrupt correction of the markets ... -lrb- when -rrb- confidence for different reasons could evaporate or could be reduced , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's finance minister sadakazu tanigaki , right , and bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui , left , listen to translation of speeches at the start of the g7 meeting .
rato in addition cited the " need for asian countries to have more flexible exchange rates " after the g7 implicitly called on china to relax its yuan-dollar currency peg .
china 's policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar has been harshly criticized by the us , which considers it tantamount to a government subsidy to the rising power 's already highly competitive exporters . deficits or slow growth to blame ? the imf head has not been alone in sounding the alarm about the persistent deficit in the us current account , a broad measure of trade in goods and services as well as certain financial transfers . the current account shortfall unnerves rato and other economists because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , left , and european central bank president , jean-claude trichet at the g7 meeting .
us treasury secretary john snow has acknowledged that washington needs to shrink its current account deficit but maintains that much of the problem lies with weakness in europe and japan , which prevents consumers there from buying us goods . that argument was rejected by a senior french official last week who said france in fact enjoys strong domestic demand and suggested that washington was trying to shift the blame . no breakthrough on debt despite any sign of concrete headway , g7 ministers meanwhile claimed progress towards their goal of erasing an $ 80 billion multilateral debt burden that sees more money go to interest repayments than to health or education in the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britains chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , left .
" it 's now recognised , i think for the first time from these meetings , that more money has to be made available , " british finance minister gordon brown , the g7 's current chairman , told a news conference .
brown has made debt relief for developing countries one of his priorities . " what we must now do is get the international agreement on sums of money and we believe that that will come at gleneagles , " he said in reference to a group of eight - the g7 plus russia - summit in scotland in july . the g7 ministers made no mention of a brown-inspired proposal under which the imf would sell a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed it by poor countries .
the imf says such a sale is technically feasible but the united states fears that offloading the reserves , which at current rates are worth 45 billion dollars , would destabilise the markets . besides the possible selling of imf gold , other options to finance debt relief include a proposal by france and germany to levy a global tax on airline tickets and jet fuel .
german finance minister hans eichel said the proposal would be " very easy to put into place . "
he added , however , that he " regretted the absence of political commitment " of g7 partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kendra sudano , left , and lia gillis , right , both of washington , hold up signs outside of the treasury department , in background , protesting the g7 meeting .
campaigners berated the g7 bickering .
they said another two million children younger than five would die before the gleneagles summit in july from disease and malnutrition brought about by extreme poverty .

the warning from international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- managing director rodrigo rato on saturday followed a twice-yearly meeting here of the imf policy-making committee , made up of senior finance chiefs from around the world .
earlier in the day finance ministers and central bankers from the powerful group of seven industrialized countries issued an upbeat statement on global prospects , predicting " solid growth for 2005 " despite higher oil prices and an uneven pace of activity across several regions . " since our meeting in february the global expansion has remained robust and the outlook continues to point to solid growth for 2005 , " ministers said in a statement issued after the weekend talks in washington . but the group of seven - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - failed to find common ground on debt relief for the world 's most impoverished nations , a failure that anti-poverty campaigners said would result in the deaths of millions more children . not so rosy rato dampened the optimism in the g7 statement with unusually pointed remarks aimed at some of the planet 's most influential economic players .
he said the global financial system was now out of kilter because of the huge us current account deficit , weak growth in europe and japan , the low savings rate of us consumers and inflexible currency regimes in asia . " if policies do not adapt , do not change to react to these imbalances , we run the risk of an abrupt correction of the markets ... -lrb- when -rrb- confidence for different reasons could evaporate or could be reduced , " he told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's finance minister sadakazu tanigaki , right , and bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui , left , listen to translation of speeches at the start of the g7 meeting .
rato in addition cited the " need for asian countries to have more flexible exchange rates " after the g7 implicitly called on china to relax its yuan-dollar currency peg .
china 's policy of pegging the yuan to the dollar has been harshly criticized by the us , which considers it tantamount to a government subsidy to the rising power 's already highly competitive exporters . deficits or slow growth to blame ? the imf head has not been alone in sounding the alarm about the persistent deficit in the us current account , a broad measure of trade in goods and services as well as certain financial transfers . the current account shortfall unnerves rato and other economists because it raises fears that foreign investors will lose confidence in the united states and begin to shun us assets .
that could further weaken the dollar in a disorderly manner , prompting the us federal reserve to raise interest rates at a pace that would threaten global growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us federal reserve chairman , alan greenspan , left , and european central bank president , jean-claude trichet at the g7 meeting .
us treasury secretary john snow has acknowledged that washington needs to shrink its current account deficit but maintains that much of the problem lies with weakness in europe and japan , which prevents consumers there from buying us goods . that argument was rejected by a senior french official last week who said france in fact enjoys strong domestic demand and suggested that washington was trying to shift the blame . no breakthrough on debt despite any sign of concrete headway , g7 ministers meanwhile claimed progress towards their goal of erasing an $ 80 billion multilateral debt burden that sees more money go to interest repayments than to health or education in the developing world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britains chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown , left .
" it 's now recognised , i think for the first time from these meetings , that more money has to be made available , " british finance minister gordon brown , the g7 's current chairman , told a news conference .
brown has made debt relief for developing countries one of his priorities . " what we must now do is get the international agreement on sums of money and we believe that that will come at gleneagles , " he said in reference to a group of eight - the g7 plus russia - summit in scotland in july . the g7 ministers made no mention of a brown-inspired proposal under which the imf would sell a portion of its massive gold reserves to cancel the debt owed it by poor countries .
the imf says such a sale is technically feasible but the united states fears that offloading the reserves , which at current rates are worth 45 billion dollars , would destabilise the markets . besides the possible selling of imf gold , other options to finance debt relief include a proposal by france and germany to levy a global tax on airline tickets and jet fuel .
german finance minister hans eichel said the proposal would be " very easy to put into place . "
he added , however , that he " regretted the absence of political commitment " of g7 partners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kendra sudano , left , and lia gillis , right , both of washington , hold up signs outside of the treasury department , in background , protesting the g7 meeting .
campaigners berated the g7 bickering .
they said another two million children younger than five would die before the gleneagles summit in july from disease and malnutrition brought about by extreme poverty .
" they say they have the will , we all know the way , but once more the g7 have chosen delay , " said jonathan hepburn , policy adviser for oxfam international .

is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ? the german capital may be one of the liveliest cities in the world , but apparently , plenty of its citizens do n't even want to get out of bed in the morning . according to a 2005 health survey published this week by dak , a german health insurer , the number of people diagnosed with depression in berlin has risen 70 percent since 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a study of 90,000 working berliners revealed that while 10 percent fewer people took sick leave from work in the past year , some 12 percent of those who stayed home did so because they were suffering from depression and panic attacks .
mental problems are therefore the top reason for absence from work , well ahead of other health issues . urban anxiety berlin registered more cases of sick leave for psychological reasons than any other state in germany , with the residents of hamburg and bremen limping in close behind . one reason could be that germany is still malingering in the shadow of fiscal gloom . " in times of economic insecurity , young people in particular tend to develop psychological problems in response to professional and private obstacles , " explained dak ceo herbert rebscher . surprisingly , however , psychological difficulties seem to be less of a burden in the struggling eastern states . a nation of cry-babies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so why are so many berliners so down-in-the-mouth ?
maybe they 're just the only ones admitting how bad they feel .
therapy and mental illness are far less of a taboo in liberal , anonymous urban environments than in small towns and rural areas .
because treatment is far more widely available in cities , more people are willing to seek help , thereby boosting the statistics . according to the dak report , 70 percent of germans say they would turn to the professionals for advice and support with psychological problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but hans-dieter nolting from the institute for health and social research suspects that germans have simply become more sensitive .
at the same time , public pressure to get ahead makes it harder to nip emerging problems in the bud . who can afford to call in sick just because they 're feeling a bit weepy ? the cut-throat modern world in a similar vein , rebscher cited " the transformation of the modern working world " as a key factor . the high-octane climate of contemporary life is taking its toll , he says . in a nation of 5 million unemployed , performance anxiety , fear of failure , rivalry , the threat of layoffs and bullying in the workplace can all contribute to a sense of helplessness and despair . young people are particularly prone to melancholy .
psychological problems in men between 25 and 29 and women between 20 and 24 have doubled .
women are more likely to seek help . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might not have to work anymore , but the elderly are n't exactly jumping with joy either .
one in three pensioners say they suffer from one or another form of psychological illness .
ten years ago , only 18 percent admitted to feeling blue . even so , most germans would rather be employed and depressed than unemployed and happy .
it 's a vicious circle .

the euro coins from the world 's smallest countries have become collector items - and demand a high price . for two weeks now , life for numismatists has taken a noticeable turn for the better - assuming they have coins from vatican city or monaco .
the deaths of john paul ii and prince rainier , have created a boom for coins from europe 's smallest states on online auction web site ebay .
clicking onto the company 's german web site and going to the coin page , it becomes clear just how excessively the market has grown .
there are more than twice as many vatican coins up for sale as those from any other european country .
monaco ranks fourth .
" since the death of the pope , there has been a 50 percent increase in the price of vatican coins with john paul 's image , " said editor-in-chief wolfgang erzinger of the german coin collector magazine , deutsches münzen magazin .
speculative bubble or just popularity ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul was not only popular in person , vatican coins with his image have been a hit amongst collectors the one million coins that the vatican is allowed to mint annually were valuable collector items even before john paul 's death .
now , the set of all eight coins minted in 2004 is fetching prices upwards of 500 euros -lrb- $ 645 -rrb- , according to the independent .
of course , john paul 's passing away will squeeze the supply which was minimal to begin with .
a second factor is also driving prices up , namely the unmatched popularity of john paul ii as head of the roman catholic church .
christians , particularly roman catholics , have thrown their hat into the bidding rings , pushing prices even higher .
according to erzinger , they , unlike collectors and speculators , will hold onto the coins , thus reducing the total number on the market .
such a sudden increase in valuation may lead the general public to believe that an artificial bubble is being created .
erzinger did n't want to speculate himself if more profits can be reaped by speculators .
what he did say is that people are placing bets on it .
" it is n't clear if the 2004 minted coins are the last ones that will be circulating , " he said .
" the 2005 coins are ready but it is still not clear if they will be released into circulation . "
monaco not comparable , but still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the one euro coin from monaco just like the number of visitors to prince rainier 's funeral on friday paled in comparison to that of the pope 's , the number of transactions for monaco coins is lower .
yet , even here , the prices would make even the most hardened coin collector blush .
for example , the starter kits in monaco before the euro was introduced on jan .
1 , 2002 , had a face value of 15.25 euros and included all eight coins .
one seller on ebay in germany had managed to get his hands on one of the 51,200 starter kits at that time .
with one day remaining in the auction , the highest bid stood at 757,88 euros .
a 4,800 percent increase .
the business for euro coins is so lucrative that andorra , the tiny state tucked in between spain and france , has petitioned brussels to mint its own coins . john kluempers , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope laid to rest after emotional mass the world looked to rome as leaders from more than 100 nations and a multitude of mourners gathered for the funeral on friday of pope john paul ii , one of the most cherished pontiffs in history .

the search engine giant now provides satellite photographs of many locations in the us and canada .
users need only type in a post code and a photo from space of that location - if available - is then shown .
it has prompted some users to compile a gallery of the more interesting results while another has used the photos in association with photo-sharing site flickr to give a guide to his childhood .
digital map matt haughey gives people a tour from space of his childhood haunts the satellite maps are provided by digital map maker keyhole corporation , which was bought by google last year .
at the moment google only offers satellite images of locations in the us and canada but keyhole has data for the whole globe so the service could be rolled out for other countries .
while satellite images have been commercially available for some time , the cost has put the photos out of reach of most individuals .
satellite imaging firm earthsat sells photos which can cost about $ 22 -lrb- £ 14 -rrb- per square kilometre with a minimum purchase of 25 square kilometres .
the detail in some of the google photos is impressive - putting zoom at the highest level lets you pick out individual houses and even cars .
almost any address has a satellite photo version but keyhole has tried to calm privacy fears by pointing out that the photos are at least six months old .
the stadium home of the san francisco 49'ers one website has begun to compile links to photographs of some of the most famous and unusual locations in the us and canada .
football stadia , nuclear plants , air force bases and even the fabled " area 51 " are among the locations to have satellite photos .
another user matt haughey has used the maps in conjunction with photo sharing tool flickr to give people a potted guide to his childhood in yorba linda , near los angeles , in california .
haughey , a director at copyright organisation creative commons , has used a satellite photo of where he used to live and added annotated notes so that people can follow incidents in his youth at the precise location they happened .
the house where he was born , the childhood homes of his friends and past girlfriends , the route of his paper round and where he met his wife for the first time are all shown along with accompanying notes .
