" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.

in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .

the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .
a new leftist alliance , seen as a potential vote-robber for both the spd and the greens , reached eight percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the troubled red-green legacy hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament .

the capital and tourist magnet is being embarrassingly indecisive .
again . berlin might like to sell itself as germany 's most dynamic metropolis , but more often than not , the city comes off like a provincial village .
in less than a year , the city will host the world cup final - one of the greatest events in sport .
only the privileged few will manage to get tickets to that match , but the masses that do n't fit into berlin 's olympic stadium should n't be left out of the fun . the other 11 cities were the world 's best soccer players will kick the ball around all have come up with concepts for large outdoor festivals , where fans can celebrate and watch the matches on big video screens .
only berlin remains without a plan .
the events - under the official auspices of soccer 's organizing body fifa and the tournament 's main corporate sponsors - will aim to offer lots of fan and family-friendly entertainment .
they will also give the german host cities a chance to present themselves to the public . bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main already has a plan naturally , those official parties will be a huge draw for the hordes of tv crews eager to beam happy and colorful images around the world .
in the global hard-fought battle for tourists and the cash they leave where they visit , it 's not hard to imagine what a unique opportunity the world cup offers germany 's cities to market themselves to the world .
but berlin 's dithering could cost the capital dearly . ironically , germany 's leading city already had a plan for its official fan festival .
the city 's main axis that cuts through the central tiergarten park and leads straight to the famous brandenburg gate was already under consideration last year , as the broad boulevard has already been used for similar large events including the techno festival love parade and last week 's germany edition of the worldwide live 8 concerts . " we want this location since there 's nothing like it anywhere else in the world , " said hanns peter nerger , the head of berlin 's tourist marketing corporation . gridlock traffic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasse des 17 .
juni the berlin 's city government had giving its assurances to fifa in writing that the axis , along the straße des 17 .
juni would be available for a mile-long world cup festival .
but the senate abruptly changed its mind after realizing one of the city 's major traffic arteries would be shut for over a month with the tournament took place in june and july of next year .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit apparently fears chaos if the 40,000 cars that use the street each day are diverted elsewhere , potentially annoying berliners and jeopardizing his re-election chances in fall 2006 . that 's left the most important world cup host city scrambling for an appropriate location for its official fan festival .
finding a new one wo n't be easy since the party-mile was an integral part of the berlin concept .
and that 's upsetting several of the organizers . " we still have a few problems to solve before berlin can show its best side , " saod fedor radmann , an advisor to the germany 's official world cup organizing committee . regardless of where the official party ends up , there will certainly be plenty of inofficial places for fans to gather to watch the matches in berlin .
whether in bars , beergardens or pubs - soccer will be omnipresent in the city next summer .
sporting goods maker adidas even wants to show the matches in a mini-replica olympic stadium for 8,500 fans right in front of the reichstag . still , some are concerned the capital 's image will be damaged if the embarrassing confusion is n't quickly taken care of .
" at some point we have to know where all the events will take place , " said berlin city council man from the district of charlottenburg-wilmersdorf klaus-dieter gröhler .
" i believe the importance of this spectacle is underestimated in berlin .

" next week , on july 13 , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will discuss further measures in the fight against terrorism , in particular a proposal for a terrorism-related rapid response mechanism , " frattini said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini at the meeting , the commission will ask governments to " work more quickly and all together … to create a computerised european intelligence network . " the eu has made similar statements in the past , and it remains to be seen whether the attack on london will help speed a process often criticized for being slow and ineffective . sept.11 was first trigger following the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , heads of state and government in the european union agreed on the need to boost cooperation to better protect against terrorism .
but for a long time , not much happened .
then , on march 11 , 2004 , terrorists struck on european soil , blowing up several commuter trains in madrid .
the eu renewed its vow to fight terrorism , even naming a new commissioner for the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters stand during five minutes of silence commemorating the victims of the march 11 , 2004 train bombings at madrid 's atocha train station , friday , march 11 , 2005 .
there was no shortage of declarations , action plans and papers .
but putting proposed measures into practice in the eu member states has been a slow process .
a year after the madrid attacks , national intelligence services were still reluctant to invite outside scrutiny , said the eu 's anti-terror coordinator , gijs de vries .
on the other hand , much has already happened that the public is simply not aware of . " the secret services ca n't print their secrets in the newspaper , " de vries said .
" when you 're frustrated by something , you only notice when nothing happens .
the successes are hard to recognize , but they 're there . " in november 2004 , the eu approved the hague program , a re-worked action plan written in the aftermath of the madrid attacks .
under the program , eu member states agreed to improve the exchange of information about terrorist activity among national intelligence agencies .
the hague-based eu police force , europol , was charged with collecting and analyzing the information .
but responsibility for complying in the program still rests with national security officials . a rrest warrant a success the europe-wide arrest warrant - a move that was long fought over - is now in place .
the eu commission has already deemed it a success , as it has enabled more than 100 people to be arrested since february of this year .
but only a few of those arrests were on charges of terrorist activity .
in germany , a lawsuit against the cross-border arrest warrant is pending before the federal constitutional court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german border police in action the eu is also improving its efforts to control its outside borders .
there are already unified regulations on the granting of visas , but that has not yet been extended to asylum and immigration policy . a new computer system called " schengen ii " should , in a few years , offer faster access to data on people entering the bloc , as well as police data .
from this year , biometric information can be included in passports . another controversial point in the eu 's anti-terror measures is the saving of data on telephone and internet use over a longer period of time .
the eu commission proposed such a measure because telephone data played a key role in the investigation of the madrid bombings . privacy a concern civil rights groups such as the british group " statewatch " have repeatedly warned against unnecessarily strong infringements on privacy and civil liberties .
us home security officials , on the other hand , have accused the europeans of doing too little , too slowly . following the terror attacks in london , there is again new impetus for the eu to move forward its anti-terror measures . on friday , frattini acknowledged that the rejection recently of the european constitution in french and dutch referendums was a significant setback , as the constitution contained important steps to integrate national efforts against terrorisms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 09.07.2005 no world cup party for berlin ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin vetoed the area that has been used before by the love parade as germany gears up for the world cup next year , the cities hosting matches have all made plans for official outdoor parties - except for berlin .
the capital and tourist magnet is being embarrassingly indecisive .
again . berlin might like to sell itself as germany 's most dynamic metropolis , but more often than not , the city comes off like a provincial village .
in less than a year , the city will host the world cup final - one of the greatest events in sport .
only the privileged few will manage to get tickets to that match , but the masses that do n't fit into berlin 's olympic stadium should n't be left out of the fun . the other 11 cities were the world 's best soccer players will kick the ball around all have come up with concepts for large outdoor festivals , where fans can celebrate and watch the matches on big video screens .
only berlin remains without a plan .
the events - under the official auspices of soccer 's organizing body fifa and the tournament 's main corporate sponsors - will aim to offer lots of fan and family-friendly entertainment .
they will also give the german host cities a chance to present themselves to the public . bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main already has a plan naturally , those official parties will be a huge draw for the hordes of tv crews eager to beam happy and colorful images around the world .
in the global hard-fought battle for tourists and the cash they leave where they visit , it 's not hard to imagine what a unique opportunity the world cup offers germany 's cities to market themselves to the world .
but berlin 's dithering could cost the capital dearly . ironically , germany 's leading city already had a plan for its official fan festival .
the city 's main axis that cuts through the central tiergarten park and leads straight to the famous brandenburg gate was already under consideration last year , as the broad boulevard has already been used for similar large events including the techno festival love parade and last week 's germany edition of the worldwide live 8 concerts . " we want this location since there 's nothing like it anywhere else in the world , " said hanns peter nerger , the head of berlin 's tourist marketing corporation . gridlock traffic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasse des 17 .
juni the berlin 's city government had giving its assurances to fifa in writing that the axis , along the straße des 17 .
juni would be available for a mile-long world cup festival .
but the senate abruptly changed its mind after realizing one of the city 's major traffic arteries would be shut for over a month with the tournament took place in june and july of next year .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit apparently fears chaos if the 40,000 cars that use the street each day are diverted elsewhere , potentially annoying berliners and jeopardizing his re-election chances in fall 2006 . that 's left the most important world cup host city scrambling for an appropriate location for its official fan festival .
finding a new one wo n't be easy since the party-mile was an integral part of the berlin concept .
and that 's upsetting several of the organizers . " we still have a few problems to solve before berlin can show its best side , " saod fedor radmann , an advisor to the germany 's official world cup organizing committee . regardless of where the official party ends up , there will certainly be plenty of inofficial places for fans to gather to watch the matches in berlin .
whether in bars , beergardens or pubs - soccer will be omnipresent in the city next summer .
sporting goods maker adidas even wants to show the matches in a mini-replica olympic stadium for 8,500 fans right in front of the reichstag . still , some are concerned the capital 's image will be damaged if the embarrassing confusion is n't quickly taken care of .
" at some point we have to know where all the events will take place , " said berlin city council man from the district of charlottenburg-wilmersdorf klaus-dieter gröhler .
" i believe the importance of this spectacle is underestimated in berlin . " dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live 8 organizers lash out at berlin apathy the german parliament and the city of berlin brushed back charges friday from the organizers of the german live8 charity concert for africa that they have failed to give sufficient backing to the event .
-lrb- july 2 , 2005 -rrb- germany face world cup with optimism after crashing out of euro 2004 , germany were just glad to have qualified for the 2006 world cup as hosts but now there is a genuine belief that they can lift the trophy .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .
the world must learn the reason behind terrorism and " try to pull it up by its roots , " blair said in a bbc radio interview on saturday . " probably with this type of terrorism the solution can not only be the security measures .

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .

now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .
a new leftist alliance , seen as a potential vote-robber for both the spd and the greens , reached eight percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the troubled red-green legacy hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament .

but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .

he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2005 germany 's greens face political wilderness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party is ready to fight germany 's environmentalist green party gathers this weekend in berlin to hammer out an election platform ahead of a likely national poll that is widely expected to cut short their first stint in the federal government . foreign minister joschka fischer and some 850 delegates will huddle saturday and sunday in berlin to chart a way forward amid rock-bottom poll ratings for their seven-year-old coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .
a new leftist alliance , seen as a potential vote-robber for both the spd and the greens , reached eight percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the troubled red-green legacy hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far .
-lrb- july 1 , 2005 -rrb- schröder loses confidence vote with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure .

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .

the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .

the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .

the capital and tourist magnet is being embarrassingly indecisive .
again . berlin might like to sell itself as germany 's most dynamic metropolis , but more often than not , the city comes off like a provincial village .
in less than a year , the city will host the world cup final - one of the greatest events in sport .
only the privileged few will manage to get tickets to that match , but the masses that do n't fit into berlin 's olympic stadium should n't be left out of the fun . the other 11 cities were the world 's best soccer players will kick the ball around all have come up with concepts for large outdoor festivals , where fans can celebrate and watch the matches on big video screens .
only berlin remains without a plan .
the events - under the official auspices of soccer 's organizing body fifa and the tournament 's main corporate sponsors - will aim to offer lots of fan and family-friendly entertainment .
they will also give the german host cities a chance to present themselves to the public . bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main already has a plan naturally , those official parties will be a huge draw for the hordes of tv crews eager to beam happy and colorful images around the world .
in the global hard-fought battle for tourists and the cash they leave where they visit , it 's not hard to imagine what a unique opportunity the world cup offers germany 's cities to market themselves to the world .
but berlin 's dithering could cost the capital dearly . ironically , germany 's leading city already had a plan for its official fan festival .
the city 's main axis that cuts through the central tiergarten park and leads straight to the famous brandenburg gate was already under consideration last year , as the broad boulevard has already been used for similar large events including the techno festival love parade and last week 's germany edition of the worldwide live 8 concerts . " we want this location since there 's nothing like it anywhere else in the world , " said hanns peter nerger , the head of berlin 's tourist marketing corporation . gridlock traffic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasse des 17 .
juni the berlin 's city government had giving its assurances to fifa in writing that the axis , along the straße des 17 .
juni would be available for a mile-long world cup festival .
but the senate abruptly changed its mind after realizing one of the city 's major traffic arteries would be shut for over a month with the tournament took place in june and july of next year .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit apparently fears chaos if the 40,000 cars that use the street each day are diverted elsewhere , potentially annoying berliners and jeopardizing his re-election chances in fall 2006 . that 's left the most important world cup host city scrambling for an appropriate location for its official fan festival .
finding a new one wo n't be easy since the party-mile was an integral part of the berlin concept .
and that 's upsetting several of the organizers . " we still have a few problems to solve before berlin can show its best side , " saod fedor radmann , an advisor to the germany 's official world cup organizing committee . regardless of where the official party ends up , there will certainly be plenty of inofficial places for fans to gather to watch the matches in berlin .
whether in bars , beergardens or pubs - soccer will be omnipresent in the city next summer .
sporting goods maker adidas even wants to show the matches in a mini-replica olympic stadium for 8,500 fans right in front of the reichstag . still , some are concerned the capital 's image will be damaged if the embarrassing confusion is n't quickly taken care of .
" at some point we have to know where all the events will take place , " said berlin city council man from the district of charlottenburg-wilmersdorf klaus-dieter gröhler .
" i believe the importance of this spectacle is underestimated in berlin .

" we want this location since there 's nothing like it anywhere else in the world , " said hanns peter nerger , the head of berlin 's tourist marketing corporation . gridlock traffic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasse des 17 .
juni the berlin 's city government had giving its assurances to fifa in writing that the axis , along the straße des 17 .
juni would be available for a mile-long world cup festival .
but the senate abruptly changed its mind after realizing one of the city 's major traffic arteries would be shut for over a month with the tournament took place in june and july of next year .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit apparently fears chaos if the 40,000 cars that use the street each day are diverted elsewhere , potentially annoying berliners and jeopardizing his re-election chances in fall 2006 . that 's left the most important world cup host city scrambling for an appropriate location for its official fan festival .
finding a new one wo n't be easy since the party-mile was an integral part of the berlin concept .
and that 's upsetting several of the organizers . " we still have a few problems to solve before berlin can show its best side , " saod fedor radmann , an advisor to the germany 's official world cup organizing committee . regardless of where the official party ends up , there will certainly be plenty of inofficial places for fans to gather to watch the matches in berlin .
whether in bars , beergardens or pubs - soccer will be omnipresent in the city next summer .
sporting goods maker adidas even wants to show the matches in a mini-replica olympic stadium for 8,500 fans right in front of the reichstag . still , some are concerned the capital 's image will be damaged if the embarrassing confusion is n't quickly taken care of .
" at some point we have to know where all the events will take place , " said berlin city council man from the district of charlottenburg-wilmersdorf klaus-dieter gröhler .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .
the world must learn the reason behind terrorism and " try to pull it up by its roots , " blair said in a bbc radio interview on saturday . " probably with this type of terrorism the solution can not only be the security measures .

but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2005 germany 's greens face political wilderness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party is ready to fight germany 's environmentalist green party gathers this weekend in berlin to hammer out an election platform ahead of a likely national poll that is widely expected to cut short their first stint in the federal government . foreign minister joschka fischer and some 850 delegates will huddle saturday and sunday in berlin to chart a way forward amid rock-bottom poll ratings for their seven-year-old coalition with chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .

he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .
the world must learn the reason behind terrorism and " try to pull it up by its roots , " blair said in a bbc radio interview on saturday . " probably with this type of terrorism the solution can not only be the security measures .
i have never really doubted that myself , " blair said .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .
the world must learn the reason behind terrorism and " try to pull it up by its roots , " blair said in a bbc radio interview on saturday . " probably with this type of terrorism the solution can not only be the security measures .
i have never really doubted that myself , " blair said .

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .
a new leftist alliance , seen as a potential vote-robber for both the spd and the greens , reached eight percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the troubled red-green legacy hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament .

the country 's equivalent of the oscars was for the first time awarded by a 600-member academy . the film " alles auf zucker " -lrb- go for zucker -rrb- won six " lola " awards including best film , best director and best actor .
the movie breaks new ground in german cinema by taking a light-hearted look at jewish life in germany . it chronicles the travails of a german-jewish gambler played by actor henry hübchen . " i just beat hitler ! " said hübchen after winning the best actor award ahead of bruno ganz , who was nominated for an acclaimed performance as the nazi dictator in the oscar-nominated movie " der untergang " -lrb- downfall -rrb- . " alles auf zucker " only cost just 1.5 million euros but has made three times that at the box office .
the german film prize , sponsored by the german government , are worth a total 2.85 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- , making them among the most lucrative film awards worldwide . new academy it was the first year that the awards were allocated by a new 600-member german film academy , modelled on the academy that is responsible for hollywood 's oscars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia jentzsch best actress went to julia jentsch for " sophie scholl " .
the only other film with more than one prize was " rhythm is it ! " , featuring sir simon rattle , director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra .
it won the best documentary and best editing prizes . but " alles auf zucker " was the night 's big winner .
the movie eschews political correctness to make fun of the differences between both jews and gentiles , as well as east and west germans .
" i think this film was a sort of liberation for a lot of people , " director dani levy told reuters .
" people tell me how relieved they are after seeing the movie about jews that they are free to laugh about .
i 'm happy audiences enjoy it . " though he now lives in berlin , the 47-year-old jewish levy was born in switzerland after his mother fled the german capital in 1939 .
making his film took levy four years because many in the german film industry were leery of backing a comedy with such topic matter . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german films buck cinematic decline germany 's best actors and directors have plenty to thank viewers for in their speeches at friday night ’ s german film prize ceremony .
though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever .

from this year , biometric information can be included in passports . another controversial point in the eu 's anti-terror measures is the saving of data on telephone and internet use over a longer period of time .
the eu commission proposed such a measure because telephone data played a key role in the investigation of the madrid bombings . privacy a concern civil rights groups such as the british group " statewatch " have repeatedly warned against unnecessarily strong infringements on privacy and civil liberties .

" next week , on july 13 , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will discuss further measures in the fight against terrorism , in particular a proposal for a terrorism-related rapid response mechanism , " frattini said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini at the meeting , the commission will ask governments to " work more quickly and all together … to create a computerised european intelligence network . " the eu has made similar statements in the past , and it remains to be seen whether the attack on london will help speed a process often criticized for being slow and ineffective . sept.11 was first trigger following the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , heads of state and government in the european union agreed on the need to boost cooperation to better protect against terrorism .
but for a long time , not much happened .
then , on march 11 , 2004 , terrorists struck on european soil , blowing up several commuter trains in madrid .
the eu renewed its vow to fight terrorism , even naming a new commissioner for the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters stand during five minutes of silence commemorating the victims of the march 11 , 2004 train bombings at madrid 's atocha train station , friday , march 11 , 2005 .

but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .

" next week , on july 13 , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will discuss further measures in the fight against terrorism , in particular a proposal for a terrorism-related rapid response mechanism , " frattini said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini at the meeting , the commission will ask governments to " work more quickly and all together … to create a computerised european intelligence network . " the eu has made similar statements in the past , and it remains to be seen whether the attack on london will help speed a process often criticized for being slow and ineffective . sept.11 was first trigger following the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , heads of state and government in the european union agreed on the need to boost cooperation to better protect against terrorism .
but for a long time , not much happened .
then , on march 11 , 2004 , terrorists struck on european soil , blowing up several commuter trains in madrid .
the eu renewed its vow to fight terrorism , even naming a new commissioner for the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters stand during five minutes of silence commemorating the victims of the march 11 , 2004 train bombings at madrid 's atocha train station , friday , march 11 , 2005 .
there was no shortage of declarations , action plans and papers .
but putting proposed measures into practice in the eu member states has been a slow process .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .
the world must learn the reason behind terrorism and " try to pull it up by its roots , " blair said in a bbc radio interview on saturday . " probably with this type of terrorism the solution can not only be the security measures .
i have never really doubted that myself , " blair said .

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .
a new leftist alliance , seen as a potential vote-robber for both the spd and the greens , reached eight percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the troubled red-green legacy hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament .

" next week , on july 13 , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will discuss further measures in the fight against terrorism , in particular a proposal for a terrorism-related rapid response mechanism , " frattini said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini at the meeting , the commission will ask governments to " work more quickly and all together … to create a computerised european intelligence network . " the eu has made similar statements in the past , and it remains to be seen whether the attack on london will help speed a process often criticized for being slow and ineffective . sept.11 was first trigger following the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , heads of state and government in the european union agreed on the need to boost cooperation to better protect against terrorism .
but for a long time , not much happened .
then , on march 11 , 2004 , terrorists struck on european soil , blowing up several commuter trains in madrid .
the eu renewed its vow to fight terrorism , even naming a new commissioner for the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters stand during five minutes of silence commemorating the victims of the march 11 , 2004 train bombings at madrid 's atocha train station , friday , march 11 , 2005 .
there was no shortage of declarations , action plans and papers .
but putting proposed measures into practice in the eu member states has been a slow process .
a year after the madrid attacks , national intelligence services were still reluctant to invite outside scrutiny , said the eu 's anti-terror coordinator , gijs de vries .
on the other hand , much has already happened that the public is simply not aware of . " the secret services ca n't print their secrets in the newspaper , " de vries said .
" when you 're frustrated by something , you only notice when nothing happens .
the successes are hard to recognize , but they 're there . " in november 2004 , the eu approved the hague program , a re-worked action plan written in the aftermath of the madrid attacks .

the country 's equivalent of the oscars was for the first time awarded by a 600-member academy . the film " alles auf zucker " -lrb- go for zucker -rrb- won six " lola " awards including best film , best director and best actor .
the movie breaks new ground in german cinema by taking a light-hearted look at jewish life in germany . it chronicles the travails of a german-jewish gambler played by actor henry hübchen . " i just beat hitler ! " said hübchen after winning the best actor award ahead of bruno ganz , who was nominated for an acclaimed performance as the nazi dictator in the oscar-nominated movie " der untergang " -lrb- downfall -rrb- .

the german film prize , sponsored by the german government , are worth a total 2.85 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- , making them among the most lucrative film awards worldwide . new academy it was the first year that the awards were allocated by a new 600-member german film academy , modelled on the academy that is responsible for hollywood 's oscars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia jentzsch best actress went to julia jentsch for " sophie scholl " .
the only other film with more than one prize was " rhythm is it ! " , featuring sir simon rattle , director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra .
it won the best documentary and best editing prizes . but " alles auf zucker " was the night 's big winner .
the movie eschews political correctness to make fun of the differences between both jews and gentiles , as well as east and west germans .
" i think this film was a sort of liberation for a lot of people , " director dani levy told reuters .
" people tell me how relieved they are after seeing the movie about jews that they are free to laugh about .
i 'm happy audiences enjoy it . " though he now lives in berlin , the 47-year-old jewish levy was born in switzerland after his mother fled the german capital in 1939 .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .
the world must learn the reason behind terrorism and " try to pull it up by its roots , " blair said in a bbc radio interview on saturday . " probably with this type of terrorism the solution can not only be the security measures .
i have never really doubted that myself , " blair said .

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .
a new leftist alliance , seen as a potential vote-robber for both the spd and the greens , reached eight percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the troubled red-green legacy hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament .

the capital and tourist magnet is being embarrassingly indecisive .
again . berlin might like to sell itself as germany 's most dynamic metropolis , but more often than not , the city comes off like a provincial village .
in less than a year , the city will host the world cup final - one of the greatest events in sport .
only the privileged few will manage to get tickets to that match , but the masses that do n't fit into berlin 's olympic stadium should n't be left out of the fun . the other 11 cities were the world 's best soccer players will kick the ball around all have come up with concepts for large outdoor festivals , where fans can celebrate and watch the matches on big video screens .
only berlin remains without a plan .
the events - under the official auspices of soccer 's organizing body fifa and the tournament 's main corporate sponsors - will aim to offer lots of fan and family-friendly entertainment .
they will also give the german host cities a chance to present themselves to the public . bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main already has a plan naturally , those official parties will be a huge draw for the hordes of tv crews eager to beam happy and colorful images around the world .
in the global hard-fought battle for tourists and the cash they leave where they visit , it 's not hard to imagine what a unique opportunity the world cup offers germany 's cities to market themselves to the world .
but berlin 's dithering could cost the capital dearly . ironically , germany 's leading city already had a plan for its official fan festival .
the city 's main axis that cuts through the central tiergarten park and leads straight to the famous brandenburg gate was already under consideration last year , as the broad boulevard has already been used for similar large events including the techno festival love parade and last week 's germany edition of the worldwide live 8 concerts . " we want this location since there 's nothing like it anywhere else in the world , " said hanns peter nerger , the head of berlin 's tourist marketing corporation . gridlock traffic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasse des 17 .
juni the berlin 's city government had giving its assurances to fifa in writing that the axis , along the straße des 17 .
juni would be available for a mile-long world cup festival .
but the senate abruptly changed its mind after realizing one of the city 's major traffic arteries would be shut for over a month with the tournament took place in june and july of next year .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit apparently fears chaos if the 40,000 cars that use the street each day are diverted elsewhere , potentially annoying berliners and jeopardizing his re-election chances in fall 2006 . that 's left the most important world cup host city scrambling for an appropriate location for its official fan festival .
finding a new one wo n't be easy since the party-mile was an integral part of the berlin concept .
and that 's upsetting several of the organizers . " we still have a few problems to solve before berlin can show its best side , " saod fedor radmann , an advisor to the germany 's official world cup organizing committee . regardless of where the official party ends up , there will certainly be plenty of inofficial places for fans to gather to watch the matches in berlin .
whether in bars , beergardens or pubs - soccer will be omnipresent in the city next summer .
sporting goods maker adidas even wants to show the matches in a mini-replica olympic stadium for 8,500 fans right in front of the reichstag . still , some are concerned the capital 's image will be damaged if the embarrassing confusion is n't quickly taken care of .
" at some point we have to know where all the events will take place , " said berlin city council man from the district of charlottenburg-wilmersdorf klaus-dieter gröhler .
" i believe the importance of this spectacle is underestimated in berlin .

" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .
the world must learn the reason behind terrorism and " try to pull it up by its roots , " blair said in a bbc radio interview on saturday . " probably with this type of terrorism the solution can not only be the security measures .
i have never really doubted that myself , " blair said .

" next week , on july 13 , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will discuss further measures in the fight against terrorism , in particular a proposal for a terrorism-related rapid response mechanism , " frattini said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini at the meeting , the commission will ask governments to " work more quickly and all together … to create a computerised european intelligence network . " the eu has made similar statements in the past , and it remains to be seen whether the attack on london will help speed a process often criticized for being slow and ineffective . sept.11 was first trigger following the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , heads of state and government in the european union agreed on the need to boost cooperation to better protect against terrorism .
but for a long time , not much happened .
then , on march 11 , 2004 , terrorists struck on european soil , blowing up several commuter trains in madrid .
the eu renewed its vow to fight terrorism , even naming a new commissioner for the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters stand during five minutes of silence commemorating the victims of the march 11 , 2004 train bombings at madrid 's atocha train station , friday , march 11 , 2005 .
there was no shortage of declarations , action plans and papers .
but putting proposed measures into practice in the eu member states has been a slow process .
a year after the madrid attacks , national intelligence services were still reluctant to invite outside scrutiny , said the eu 's anti-terror coordinator , gijs de vries .
on the other hand , much has already happened that the public is simply not aware of . " the secret services ca n't print their secrets in the newspaper , " de vries said .
" when you 're frustrated by something , you only notice when nothing happens .
the successes are hard to recognize , but they 're there . " in november 2004 , the eu approved the hague program , a re-worked action plan written in the aftermath of the madrid attacks .
under the program , eu member states agreed to improve the exchange of information about terrorist activity among national intelligence agencies .
the hague-based eu police force , europol , was charged with collecting and analyzing the information .
but responsibility for complying in the program still rests with national security officials . a rrest warrant a success the europe-wide arrest warrant - a move that was long fought over - is now in place .
the eu commission has already deemed it a success , as it has enabled more than 100 people to be arrested since february of this year .
but only a few of those arrests were on charges of terrorist activity .
in germany , a lawsuit against the cross-border arrest warrant is pending before the federal constitutional court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german border police in action the eu is also improving its efforts to control its outside borders .
there are already unified regulations on the granting of visas , but that has not yet been extended to asylum and immigration policy . a new computer system called " schengen ii " should , in a few years , offer faster access to data on people entering the bloc , as well as police data .
from this year , biometric information can be included in passports . another controversial point in the eu 's anti-terror measures is the saving of data on telephone and internet use over a longer period of time .
the eu commission proposed such a measure because telephone data played a key role in the investigation of the madrid bombings . privacy a concern civil rights groups such as the british group " statewatch " have repeatedly warned against unnecessarily strong infringements on privacy and civil liberties .
us home security officials , on the other hand , have accused the europeans of doing too little , too slowly . following the terror attacks in london , there is again new impetus for the eu to move forward its anti-terror measures . on friday , frattini acknowledged that the rejection recently of the european constitution in french and dutch referendums was a significant setback , as the constitution contained important steps to integrate national efforts against terrorisms .
" but there are some measures that can be approved ad-hoc , " he added . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .

the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .

the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2005 tourists face unauthorized organ removal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian doctors can take dead tourists ' organs without consent not many tourists know that they in some popular destinations , organs can be removed without consent after death .
but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2005 tourists face unauthorized organ removal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian doctors can take dead tourists ' organs without consent not many tourists know that they in some popular destinations , organs can be removed without consent after death .
but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .

the capital and tourist magnet is being embarrassingly indecisive .
again . berlin might like to sell itself as germany 's most dynamic metropolis , but more often than not , the city comes off like a provincial village .
in less than a year , the city will host the world cup final - one of the greatest events in sport .
only the privileged few will manage to get tickets to that match , but the masses that do n't fit into berlin 's olympic stadium should n't be left out of the fun . the other 11 cities were the world 's best soccer players will kick the ball around all have come up with concepts for large outdoor festivals , where fans can celebrate and watch the matches on big video screens .
only berlin remains without a plan .
the events - under the official auspices of soccer 's organizing body fifa and the tournament 's main corporate sponsors - will aim to offer lots of fan and family-friendly entertainment .
they will also give the german host cities a chance to present themselves to the public . bildunterschrift : frankfurt am main already has a plan naturally , those official parties will be a huge draw for the hordes of tv crews eager to beam happy and colorful images around the world .
in the global hard-fought battle for tourists and the cash they leave where they visit , it 's not hard to imagine what a unique opportunity the world cup offers germany 's cities to market themselves to the world .
but berlin 's dithering could cost the capital dearly . ironically , germany 's leading city already had a plan for its official fan festival .
the city 's main axis that cuts through the central tiergarten park and leads straight to the famous brandenburg gate was already under consideration last year , as the broad boulevard has already been used for similar large events including the techno festival love parade and last week 's germany edition of the worldwide live 8 concerts . " we want this location since there 's nothing like it anywhere else in the world , " said hanns peter nerger , the head of berlin 's tourist marketing corporation . gridlock traffic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strasse des 17 .

now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .

" next week , on july 13 , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will discuss further measures in the fight against terrorism , in particular a proposal for a terrorism-related rapid response mechanism , " frattini said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini at the meeting , the commission will ask governments to " work more quickly and all together … to create a computerised european intelligence network . " the eu has made similar statements in the past , and it remains to be seen whether the attack on london will help speed a process often criticized for being slow and ineffective . sept.11 was first trigger following the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , heads of state and government in the european union agreed on the need to boost cooperation to better protect against terrorism .
but for a long time , not much happened .
then , on march 11 , 2004 , terrorists struck on european soil , blowing up several commuter trains in madrid .
the eu renewed its vow to fight terrorism , even naming a new commissioner for the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters stand during five minutes of silence commemorating the victims of the march 11 , 2004 train bombings at madrid 's atocha train station , friday , march 11 , 2005 .
there was no shortage of declarations , action plans and papers .
but putting proposed measures into practice in the eu member states has been a slow process .
a year after the madrid attacks , national intelligence services were still reluctant to invite outside scrutiny , said the eu 's anti-terror coordinator , gijs de vries .
on the other hand , much has already happened that the public is simply not aware of . " the secret services ca n't print their secrets in the newspaper , " de vries said .
" when you 're frustrated by something , you only notice when nothing happens .
the successes are hard to recognize , but they 're there . " in november 2004 , the eu approved the hague program , a re-worked action plan written in the aftermath of the madrid attacks .
under the program , eu member states agreed to improve the exchange of information about terrorist activity among national intelligence agencies .
the hague-based eu police force , europol , was charged with collecting and analyzing the information .
but responsibility for complying in the program still rests with national security officials . a rrest warrant a success the europe-wide arrest warrant - a move that was long fought over - is now in place .
the eu commission has already deemed it a success , as it has enabled more than 100 people to be arrested since february of this year .

in germany , a lawsuit against the cross-border arrest warrant is pending before the federal constitutional court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german border police in action the eu is also improving its efforts to control its outside borders .

from this year , biometric information can be included in passports . another controversial point in the eu 's anti-terror measures is the saving of data on telephone and internet use over a longer period of time .
the eu commission proposed such a measure because telephone data played a key role in the investigation of the madrid bombings . privacy a concern civil rights groups such as the british group " statewatch " have repeatedly warned against unnecessarily strong infringements on privacy and civil liberties .
us home security officials , on the other hand , have accused the europeans of doing too little , too slowly . following the terror attacks in london , there is again new impetus for the eu to move forward its anti-terror measures . on friday , frattini acknowledged that the rejection recently of the european constitution in french and dutch referendums was a significant setback , as the constitution contained important steps to integrate national efforts against terrorisms .

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .

at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .
a new leftist alliance , seen as a potential vote-robber for both the spd and the greens , reached eight percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the troubled red-green legacy hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far .
-lrb- july 1 , 2005 -rrb- schröder loses confidence vote with an impassive face , german chancellor gerhard schröder received the news that the vote of confidence in the bundestag ended just as he hoped - in failure .
-lrb- july 1 , 2005 -rrb- an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .

near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.

in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .

paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.07.2005 tourists face unauthorized organ removal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian doctors can take dead tourists ' organs without consent not many tourists know that they in some popular destinations , organs can be removed without consent after death .
but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

but some germans opposed to this are considering ways to protect people from such unwanted procedures . it is a scenario no one wants to contemplate , particularly before going on vacation - the possibility of a serious accident , leading to death .
yet most people are unaware that in some countries , such as austria , france , italy and spain , doctors are allowed to remove human organs without consent to save the lives of others .
that does n't exclude foreign tourists . " after brain death has been confirmed , the victim may - without consulting relatives - be deboned , be exploited , " said dresden-based attorney heinrich meyer-götz .
" that means kidneys , liver , lungs , all the cartilage , corneas , veins - today they can make use of almost everything .
and the relatives have no opportunity to file a protest .
i think that 's bad . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jammed with tourists - who do n't always know the rules the summer vacation period has just begun in europe , when most germans go on holiday .
but few travelers realize that transplant regulations vary from country to country .
there are no warnings , because the organizations and politicians concerned with the issue support these more permissible laws - for everyone . " of course the austrians will say ' these particular regulations are valid here , and -lrb- ask -rrb- would you consent to the removal of organs ? " ' said claus wesslau of the german foundation for organ transplantation .
" you must expect that if you travel abroad .
on the other hand , if a recipient is given a heart from england , and this results in a life-saving operation to save his life , he 's not going to ask whether the heart was removed according to valid german law or english law . " doctors say no need for concern doctors in germany know the regulations better than their patients .
peter neuhaus is one of the country 's leading transplant surgeons .
he says people should n't be too concerned about the issue . " our colleagues in austria are very sensitive , " said neuhaus , director of the transplant center at berlin 's charité hospital .
" in austria , too , they always ask the spouse , the parents or the relatives of the deceased .
and if they say that they do n't want to donate organs , their wish is always respected . " but if they 're unable to contact a relative , doctors are allowed to remove organs without permission , according to what is known as the ' refusal regulation . ' lawyer meyer-götz provides his clients with protection from having their organs removed without consent .
they can apply for an extension to their passports that declares that the holder is unwilling to donate his or her organs .
the information is also entered into an international refusal register . too few donors but some doctors see the austrian law as a model other countries should consider emulating to help make up for the lack of organs for patients in need . " i think that the austrian solution , which is also customary in belgium and spain , really is the right solution , " said dr. neuhaus .
" unfortunately , we 're unable to push it through because of attitudes on ethical and moral grounds .
look at the german attitude towards embryonic stem cells and other debates .
we are always a little more perfect than everyone else and are constantly afraid that our individual freedom is no longer being safeguarded somewhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough organs available , german doctors say in germany , organs can only be removed with the explicit permission of the deceased .
this hurdle makes organ transplants considerably more difficult than in countries that have a refusal regulation .
the result is that germany has an acute shortage of organs . " a thousand patients on the waiting list die in germany every year , " said wesslau .
" a patient waiting for a kidney must wait on average , four to six years .
and for the patient , this is just not acceptable - not just the dying , but this long waiting period as well . " no change likely though opponents of the refusal regulation accept that changing the law could save lives , say the right to decide for oneself is more important .
" i can decide whether my organ should be removed for another person ; it 's not up to doctors to decide that they want to use it , " meyer-götz said . neither the government nor the opposition foresee an imminent change in german transplant law since germans continue to have too many reservations . " i could imagine that many people would have doubts about whether they would more or less have to be organ donors , depending on the situation , even if they did n't want it , " said julia klöckner , an opposition christian democratic party parliamentarian and member of the bundestag 's committee of enquiry into transplant law . the upshot is that germans suffering organ failure could find themselves better cared for on vacation than at home . matthias deiss -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de organ-transplant patients infected with rabies in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2005 eu to improve anti-terror measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants an improved intelligence-sharing network the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system . the european union is to speed up work on a rapid response program to coordinate pan-european reactions to large-scale terror attacks , such as the series of coordinated bombings that hit london on thursday , eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said . " next week , on july 13 , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will discuss further measures in the fight against terrorism , in particular a proposal for a terrorism-related rapid response mechanism , " frattini said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini at the meeting , the commission will ask governments to " work more quickly and all together … to create a computerised european intelligence network . " the eu has made similar statements in the past , and it remains to be seen whether the attack on london will help speed a process often criticized for being slow and ineffective . sept.11 was first trigger following the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , heads of state and government in the european union agreed on the need to boost cooperation to better protect against terrorism .
but for a long time , not much happened .
then , on march 11 , 2004 , terrorists struck on european soil , blowing up several commuter trains in madrid .
the eu renewed its vow to fight terrorism , even naming a new commissioner for the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters stand during five minutes of silence commemorating the victims of the march 11 , 2004 train bombings at madrid 's atocha train station , friday , march 11 , 2005 .
there was no shortage of declarations , action plans and papers .
but putting proposed measures into practice in the eu member states has been a slow process .
a year after the madrid attacks , national intelligence services were still reluctant to invite outside scrutiny , said the eu 's anti-terror coordinator , gijs de vries .
on the other hand , much has already happened that the public is simply not aware of . " the secret services ca n't print their secrets in the newspaper , " de vries said .
" when you 're frustrated by something , you only notice when nothing happens .
the successes are hard to recognize , but they 're there . " in november 2004 , the eu approved the hague program , a re-worked action plan written in the aftermath of the madrid attacks .
under the program , eu member states agreed to improve the exchange of information about terrorist activity among national intelligence agencies .
the hague-based eu police force , europol , was charged with collecting and analyzing the information .
but responsibility for complying in the program still rests with national security officials . a rrest warrant a success the europe-wide arrest warrant - a move that was long fought over - is now in place .
the eu commission has already deemed it a success , as it has enabled more than 100 people to be arrested since february of this year .
but only a few of those arrests were on charges of terrorist activity .
in germany , a lawsuit against the cross-border arrest warrant is pending before the federal constitutional court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german border police in action the eu is also improving its efforts to control its outside borders .
there are already unified regulations on the granting of visas , but that has not yet been extended to asylum and immigration policy . a new computer system called " schengen ii " should , in a few years , offer faster access to data on people entering the bloc , as well as police data .
from this year , biometric information can be included in passports . another controversial point in the eu 's anti-terror measures is the saving of data on telephone and internet use over a longer period of time .
the eu commission proposed such a measure because telephone data played a key role in the investigation of the madrid bombings . privacy a concern civil rights groups such as the british group " statewatch " have repeatedly warned against unnecessarily strong infringements on privacy and civil liberties .
us home security officials , on the other hand , have accused the europeans of doing too little , too slowly . following the terror attacks in london , there is again new impetus for the eu to move forward its anti-terror measures . on friday , frattini acknowledged that the rejection recently of the european constitution in french and dutch referendums was a significant setback , as the constitution contained important steps to integrate national efforts against terrorisms .
" but there are some measures that can be approved ad-hoc , " he added . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

the capital and tourist magnet is being embarrassingly indecisive .

in less than a year , the city will host the world cup final - one of the greatest events in sport .
only the privileged few will manage to get tickets to that match , but the masses that do n't fit into berlin 's olympic stadium should n't be left out of the fun . the other 11 cities were the world 's best soccer players will kick the ball around all have come up with concepts for large outdoor festivals , where fans can celebrate and watch the matches on big video screens .

in the global hard-fought battle for tourists and the cash they leave where they visit , it 's not hard to imagine what a unique opportunity the world cup offers germany 's cities to market themselves to the world .
but berlin 's dithering could cost the capital dearly . ironically , germany 's leading city already had a plan for its official fan festival .
the city 's main axis that cuts through the central tiergarten park and leads straight to the famous brandenburg gate was already under consideration last year , as the broad boulevard has already been used for similar large events including the techno festival love parade and last week 's germany edition of the worldwide live 8 concerts .

but the senate abruptly changed its mind after realizing one of the city 's major traffic arteries would be shut for over a month with the tournament took place in june and july of next year .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit apparently fears chaos if the 40,000 cars that use the street each day are diverted elsewhere , potentially annoying berliners and jeopardizing his re-election chances in fall 2006 . that 's left the most important world cup host city scrambling for an appropriate location for its official fan festival .
finding a new one wo n't be easy since the party-mile was an integral part of the berlin concept .
and that 's upsetting several of the organizers . " we still have a few problems to solve before berlin can show its best side , " saod fedor radmann , an advisor to the germany 's official world cup organizing committee . regardless of where the official party ends up , there will certainly be plenty of inofficial places for fans to gather to watch the matches in berlin .
whether in bars , beergardens or pubs - soccer will be omnipresent in the city next summer .
sporting goods maker adidas even wants to show the matches in a mini-replica olympic stadium for 8,500 fans right in front of the reichstag . still , some are concerned the capital 's image will be damaged if the embarrassing confusion is n't quickly taken care of .

taken aback by schröder 's shock decision to call for a general election this fall - one year ahead of schedule - they will be forced to fight a very different campaign than in 2002 .
at that time , they battled side-by-side with the spd and scored a record 8.6 percent of the vote , rescuing the ruling coalition after schröder 's party posted losses .
now , it is every party for itself on what is widely seen as a sinking center-left coalition government .
confidence or not ?
on july 1 , schröder deliberately lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote .
he engineered it in the hope of triggering new elections in september and winning a new mandate for his controversial economic reform drive .
president horst köhler must decide by july 22 whether to dissolve parliament and order new elections .
coalition deputies had been asked to abstain from the vote .
but 46 of the 55 greens deputies voted their confidence in schröder in a paradoxical sign of defiance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alliance 90 , a movement of the former east germany , merged with the greens in 1993 at their berlin convention , the greens - a party born in 1980 out of the environmentalist and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s - will turn their attention to bread-and-butter issues .
the party 's program is expected to include higher taxes in the upper brackets to finance cuts to non-wage labor costs for lower paid workers , as well as guaranteed , full-day child care for children up to the age of three .
heated debates are also expected on proposals to introduce a minimum wage and hike value added taxes .
greens support not immune while the greens had emerged largely unscathed from a bruising series of state election debacles for the social democrats , a key poll in germany 's most populous state in may showed a stunning reversal for the party .
the greens barely cleared the five-percent hurdle to representation in north rhine-westphalia .
this was in part due to an illegal immigration scandal threatening to engulf fischer , once germany 's most popular politician .
the party that had once seemed immune to public anger over government cuts to the cherished welfare state and chronically high unemployment suddenly realized it would likely drop out of the next ruling coalition .
proud of red-green coalition the charismatic fischer , the unofficial party leader , pledged the fight of his life in a fiery speech to parliament ahead of the no-confidence vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under close scrutiny by a parliamentary committee investigating a visa scandal " this coalition has every reason to be proud of what it has achieved , " he said .
but fischer acknowledged it had dragged its feet in the fight against joblessness , currently hovering at nearly 12 percent , undermining the confidence of german voters .
leftist alliance could drain votes since the no-confidence vote , the parties have thrown themselves into campaign mode .
the conservative opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- , led by germany 's first female candidate for chancellor , angela merkel , are enjoying an imposing lead .
a poll released friday by independent opinion research institute forschungsgruppe wahlen showed the cdu / csu with 44 percent backing , versus just 27 percent for schröder 's spd .
the greens posted nine percent against seven percent for the cdu / csu 's favored coalition partner , the liberal free democrats fdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2005 eu to improve anti-terror measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants an improved intelligence-sharing network the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system . the european union is to speed up work on a rapid response program to coordinate pan-european reactions to large-scale terror attacks , such as the series of coordinated bombings that hit london on thursday , eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said . " next week , on july 13 , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will discuss further measures in the fight against terrorism , in particular a proposal for a terrorism-related rapid response mechanism , " frattini said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini at the meeting , the commission will ask governments to " work more quickly and all together … to create a computerised european intelligence network . " the eu has made similar statements in the past , and it remains to be seen whether the attack on london will help speed a process often criticized for being slow and ineffective . sept.11 was first trigger following the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , heads of state and government in the european union agreed on the need to boost cooperation to better protect against terrorism .
but for a long time , not much happened .
then , on march 11 , 2004 , terrorists struck on european soil , blowing up several commuter trains in madrid .
the eu renewed its vow to fight terrorism , even naming a new commissioner for the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters stand during five minutes of silence commemorating the victims of the march 11 , 2004 train bombings at madrid 's atocha train station , friday , march 11 , 2005 .
there was no shortage of declarations , action plans and papers .
but putting proposed measures into practice in the eu member states has been a slow process .
a year after the madrid attacks , national intelligence services were still reluctant to invite outside scrutiny , said the eu 's anti-terror coordinator , gijs de vries .
on the other hand , much has already happened that the public is simply not aware of . " the secret services ca n't print their secrets in the newspaper , " de vries said .
" when you 're frustrated by something , you only notice when nothing happens .
the successes are hard to recognize , but they 're there . " in november 2004 , the eu approved the hague program , a re-worked action plan written in the aftermath of the madrid attacks .
under the program , eu member states agreed to improve the exchange of information about terrorist activity among national intelligence agencies .
the hague-based eu police force , europol , was charged with collecting and analyzing the information .
but responsibility for complying in the program still rests with national security officials . a rrest warrant a success the europe-wide arrest warrant - a move that was long fought over - is now in place .
the eu commission has already deemed it a success , as it has enabled more than 100 people to be arrested since february of this year .
but only a few of those arrests were on charges of terrorist activity .
in germany , a lawsuit against the cross-border arrest warrant is pending before the federal constitutional court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german border police in action the eu is also improving its efforts to control its outside borders .
there are already unified regulations on the granting of visas , but that has not yet been extended to asylum and immigration policy . a new computer system called " schengen ii " should , in a few years , offer faster access to data on people entering the bloc , as well as police data .
from this year , biometric information can be included in passports . another controversial point in the eu 's anti-terror measures is the saving of data on telephone and internet use over a longer period of time .
the eu commission proposed such a measure because telephone data played a key role in the investigation of the madrid bombings . privacy a concern civil rights groups such as the british group " statewatch " have repeatedly warned against unnecessarily strong infringements on privacy and civil liberties .
us home security officials , on the other hand , have accused the europeans of doing too little , too slowly . following the terror attacks in london , there is again new impetus for the eu to move forward its anti-terror measures . on friday , frattini acknowledged that the rejection recently of the european constitution in french and dutch referendums was a significant setback , as the constitution contained important steps to integrate national efforts against terrorisms .
" but there are some measures that can be approved ad-hoc , " he added . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2005 still no arrests in london bomb attacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb that destroyed this bus was likely left behind by someone there have been no arrests so far over the deadly london terrorist attacks , but british police said on saturday that evidence suggested it was not the work of suicide bombers . speaking two days after the morning rush hour bombings on london 's transport system which killed at least 50 people and injured around 700 , commander brian paddick of the london metropolitan police said that police were not focusing on any specific suspects . " we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .
the world must learn the reason behind terrorism and " try to pull it up by its roots , " blair said in a bbc radio interview on saturday . " probably with this type of terrorism the solution can not only be the security measures .
i have never really doubted that myself , " blair said .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .

the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .

in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.07.2005 eu to improve anti-terror measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants an improved intelligence-sharing network the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system . the european union is to speed up work on a rapid response program to coordinate pan-european reactions to large-scale terror attacks , such as the series of coordinated bombings that hit london on thursday , eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini said . " next week , on july 13 , the -lrb- european -rrb- commission will discuss further measures in the fight against terrorism , in particular a proposal for a terrorism-related rapid response mechanism , " frattini said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini at the meeting , the commission will ask governments to " work more quickly and all together … to create a computerised european intelligence network . " the eu has made similar statements in the past , and it remains to be seen whether the attack on london will help speed a process often criticized for being slow and ineffective . sept.11 was first trigger following the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states , heads of state and government in the european union agreed on the need to boost cooperation to better protect against terrorism .
but for a long time , not much happened .
then , on march 11 , 2004 , terrorists struck on european soil , blowing up several commuter trains in madrid .
the eu renewed its vow to fight terrorism , even naming a new commissioner for the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commuters stand during five minutes of silence commemorating the victims of the march 11 , 2004 train bombings at madrid 's atocha train station , friday , march 11 , 2005 .
there was no shortage of declarations , action plans and papers .
but putting proposed measures into practice in the eu member states has been a slow process .
a year after the madrid attacks , national intelligence services were still reluctant to invite outside scrutiny , said the eu 's anti-terror coordinator , gijs de vries .
on the other hand , much has already happened that the public is simply not aware of . " the secret services ca n't print their secrets in the newspaper , " de vries said .
" when you 're frustrated by something , you only notice when nothing happens .
the successes are hard to recognize , but they 're there . " in november 2004 , the eu approved the hague program , a re-worked action plan written in the aftermath of the madrid attacks .
under the program , eu member states agreed to improve the exchange of information about terrorist activity among national intelligence agencies .
the hague-based eu police force , europol , was charged with collecting and analyzing the information .
but responsibility for complying in the program still rests with national security officials . a rrest warrant a success the europe-wide arrest warrant - a move that was long fought over - is now in place .
the eu commission has already deemed it a success , as it has enabled more than 100 people to be arrested since february of this year .
but only a few of those arrests were on charges of terrorist activity .
in germany , a lawsuit against the cross-border arrest warrant is pending before the federal constitutional court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german border police in action the eu is also improving its efforts to control its outside borders .
there are already unified regulations on the granting of visas , but that has not yet been extended to asylum and immigration policy . a new computer system called " schengen ii " should , in a few years , offer faster access to data on people entering the bloc , as well as police data .
from this year , biometric information can be included in passports . another controversial point in the eu 's anti-terror measures is the saving of data on telephone and internet use over a longer period of time .
the eu commission proposed such a measure because telephone data played a key role in the investigation of the madrid bombings . privacy a concern civil rights groups such as the british group " statewatch " have repeatedly warned against unnecessarily strong infringements on privacy and civil liberties .
us home security officials , on the other hand , have accused the europeans of doing too little , too slowly . following the terror attacks in london , there is again new impetus for the eu to move forward its anti-terror measures . on friday , frattini acknowledged that the rejection recently of the european constitution in french and dutch referendums was a significant setback , as the constitution contained important steps to integrate national efforts against terrorisms .
" but there are some measures that can be approved ad-hoc , " he added . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

" we have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident , " paddick told a news conference .
" we have all our options open we are pursuing but we are not confirming that we are looking for any particular named individuals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blasts , three on the british capital 's underground rail system and one on a bus on thursday , were closely coordinated .
paddick said the underground bombs went off within 50 seconds of each other and were probably set off with timers . the bus bomb , which tore off the double-decker 's roof , had probably been left in the vehicle by someone , suggesting it may not have been the work of a suicide bomber .
" the evidence we have so far found suggests that it was a device in a bag rather than strapped to an individual , " paddick said , adding that the bombs used high explosives and were likely not home made . forensic police garbed in white picked over the bombing sites , curtained off by plastic sheets , scrambling for leads in a vast investigation focused on osama bin laden 's terror network . second group claims responsibility a second group linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda organization claimed responsibility for the synchronized blasts in a statement posted on an islamic website .
" a group of mujahedeen from a division of the abu hafs al-masri brigades piled blow after blow on the infidel capital , the british capital , leaving dead and injured , " said the statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers are escorted away from edgware road tube station in london following an explosion , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
near simultaneous explosions rocked at least five london subway stations and ripped apart a double-decker bus at the morning rush hour thursday , police said , causing at least two deaths , reportedly injuring at least 95 people and sending bloodied victims fleeing from debris-strewn blast sites . -lrb- ap photo / jane mingay -rrb- the masri division congratulated itself on " this laudable conquest " and warned that more attacks would follow .
the statement 's authenticity could not be verified .
shortly after thursday 's attacks a separate statement claiming responsibility was posted in the name of the " al-qaeda organization - jihad in europe . " investigators have yet to name any suspects , but british newspapers saturday said police had asked european counterparts for information on moroccan cleric mohammed al garbuzi , who lived in britain for 16 years before vanishing from his north london home last year . al garbuzi , 45 , heads the moroccan islamic combatant group -lrb- gicm -rrb- , blamed for attacks that killed 45 people in the moroccan city of casablanca in may 2003 .
the independent newspaper said al garbuzi was linked to abu qatada , a palestinian cleric based in london who is considered the " spiritual head " of al-qaeda in europe .
he is currently detained under british anti-terrorism laws . another paper , the sun , said police were also hunting syrian-born spanish national mustafa setmariam nasar , thought to have links to a spanish al-qaeda cell dismantled after the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states . investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this image provided by commuter alexander chadwick , taken on his mobile phone camera , passengers are evacuated from an underground train in a tunnel near kings cross station in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
at least 33 people were killed thursday in three explosions in london 's subway system , a senior police official said .
deputy assistant commissioner brian paddick said others died in an explosion on a bus in central london but gave no figures .
the second blast , at 8:56 a.m.
-lrb- 0756gmt -rrb- , in the king 's cross area of north london , killed 21 , paddick said .
-lrb- ap photo / alexander chadwick -rrb- about 100 feet -lrb- 30 meters -rrb- below the streets of london , a grisly investigation was continuing .
in the single worst blast , at least 21 people died when a bomb exploded on a piccadilly line subway train travelling between king 's cross and russell square stations in the city center . some reports warned this toll could rise by as much as 20 .
such was the devastation that emergency services have not been able to reach all of the train , given that the tunnel is only marginally wider than the carriages . engineers were considering detaching some of the carriages and towing them back to king 's cross , giving better access to the worst-hit parts of the train where more bodies likely remained , reports said . according to some experts , the scale of the damage and the fact that police say each device weighed less than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- indicates that the bombers probably used powerful military-grade plastic explosives .
as well as examining forensic evidence , a key part of the police investigation is likely to be the painstaking examination of hours of security camera footage . blair warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair british prime minister tony blair warned no amount of security could prevent the sort of attacks which brought carnage to thursday morning 's london rush hour .
the world must learn the reason behind terrorism and " try to pull it up by its roots , " blair said in a bbc radio interview on saturday . " probably with this type of terrorism the solution can not only be the security measures .

the country 's equivalent of the oscars was for the first time awarded by a 600-member academy . the film " alles auf zucker " -lrb- go for zucker -rrb- won six " lola " awards including best film , best director and best actor .
the movie breaks new ground in german cinema by taking a light-hearted look at jewish life in germany . it chronicles the travails of a german-jewish gambler played by actor henry hübchen . " i just beat hitler ! " said hübchen after winning the best actor award ahead of bruno ganz , who was nominated for an acclaimed performance as the nazi dictator in the oscar-nominated movie " der untergang " -lrb- downfall -rrb- . " alles auf zucker " only cost just 1.5 million euros but has made three times that at the box office .
the german film prize , sponsored by the german government , are worth a total 2.85 million euros -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- , making them among the most lucrative film awards worldwide . new academy it was the first year that the awards were allocated by a new 600-member german film academy , modelled on the academy that is responsible for hollywood 's oscars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia jentzsch best actress went to julia jentsch for " sophie scholl " .

it won the best documentary and best editing prizes . but " alles auf zucker " was the night 's big winner .
the movie eschews political correctness to make fun of the differences between both jews and gentiles , as well as east and west germans .
" i think this film was a sort of liberation for a lot of people , " director dani levy told reuters .
" people tell me how relieved they are after seeing the movie about jews that they are free to laugh about .
i 'm happy audiences enjoy it . " though he now lives in berlin , the 47-year-old jewish levy was born in switzerland after his mother fled the german capital in 1939 .

international development secretary hilary benn said : " this is politics demonstrating its capacity to make a difference . "
and campaigner bob geldof was satisfied the measures agreed on africa would save 10 million lives .
mr blair acknowledged the shortcomings in what the summit had achieved saying : " we do not , simply by this communique , make poverty history . "

" never before have so many people forced a change of policy onto a global agenda .
if anyone had said eight weeks ago will we get a doubling of aid , will we get a deal on debt , people would have said ' no ' , " mr geldof said .
he added that he gave the g8 summit " 10 out of 10 on aid , eight out of 10 on debt " .
irish rock star and fellow anti-poverty campaigner bono , praised the agreement to give universal access to aids drugs .
" 600,000 africans , mostly children , will remember this g8 summit at gleneagles because they will be around to remember this summit , and they would n't have otherwise , " said bono .
key points : mr blair said trade discussions in hong kong later this year should yield an end date to agricultural subsidies .
britain is to host a 1 november meeting on climate change , to assess progress .
mr blair said " only people who can change africa ultimately are the africans " . $ 3bn agreed for palestinian authority for investment in infrastructure .
nigeria 's president olusegun obasanjo described the deal as a " success " .
g8 commits to training 20,000 peacekeepers for africa .
african leaders to commit to democracy and good governance as part of the deal .
debts of the 18 poorest countries to be forgiven .
universal access to anti-hiv drugs in africa by 2010 .
summing up the g8 meeting , mr blair acknowledged : " it is n't all everyone wanted , but it is progress . "

they pledged to increase aid to the developing world by $ 50bn -lrb- £ 28.8bn -rrb- and to write off the debts of africa 's 18 poorest countries , although african nations had called for the debts of all africa to be cancelled .
bbc correspondents in key african nations assess what the g8 agreement means where they are .
barnaby phillips : south africa african leaders had waited a long time for the g8 summit , and were worried that the london bombs would take the focus away from their continent at the last moment .
in the event , their fears were not realised , with tony blair apparently determined that africa should remain top of the agenda .
mr blair said that agreements reached at gleneagles gave " real hope " that african poverty could be ended .
the increases in aid will be welcomed across africa , although it will take time for african governments , and their people , to assess to what extent they will benefit .
africa will also be looking for more detail on promises to write off the debts of the poorest countries .
fourteen african countries already knew they were going to benefit from debt cancellation , while others will now be waiting anxiously to see whether they are included .
the biggest disappointment will be with the vague commitments the g8 has reached on trade - even mr blair admitted that he would have liked to have gone further here , to reach agreements on specific dates for the phasing out of subsidies .
cotton farmers in west african countries like burkina faso and mali , and sugar cane farmers in southern african countries like swaziland and malawi , will derive little comfort from the g8 meeting .
anna borzello : nigeria one in five africans is nigerian , and 70 % of the population live on less than a dollar a day , which means any attempt to deal with poverty in africa has to deal with the west african giant .
the nigerian president , olusegun obasanjo , who is also the chairman of the african union , has been manoeuvring since the start of the year to take advantage of the mood surrounding the g8 .
his goal has been to convince creditor nations that nigeria deserves debt relief , even though it is oil-rich and one of the most corrupt countries on the planet .
he was granted his wish last month , with a 60 % debt write-off .
it is a move that has been welcomed by nigerians , who feel it is unfair to pay back loans which were largely given to military dictators .
but there is also scepticism about whether the money saved will ever be used to benefit the needy .
many feel the root cause of poverty in nigeria is not a lack of aid , not the draining effects of debt and not even , in an oil-reliant economy , unfair trade terms .
instead , it is the way that the estimated $ 360bn -lrb- £ 207bn -rrb- nigeria has earned from crude oil since the 1960s has been squandered or stolen by successive regimes .
prime minister tony blair 's efforts to put africa high on the g8 agenda have largely been met here with pleasant surprise .
but most nigerians , when asked the best way to tackle poverty , invariably answer : " good leadership " .
adam mynott : kenya there have been just two cheers from africa for the g8 outcome .
the doubling of annual aid for africa to $ 50bn has been widely welcomed , but there are concerns about whether this commitment , due to come into operation by 2010 , will be followed through .
kenyan finance minister david mwiraria said : " intentions and actualisation are not the same thing .
we would like to see a situation where there is money now . "
other critics have called the promises too vague , but the president of the african union , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who attended the meeting in scotland , said he was satisfied with the gleneagles deal .
he said the problems facing africa were being " realistically and acceptably " addressed by the international community .
he went on to pay tribute to the british prime minister .
" the meeting of the g8 leaders and african leaders in gleneagles is a great success and we thank and congratulate prime minister tony blair for the success achieved . "
many africans were looking to gleneagles to tackle what they see as the main obstacle standing in the way of the continent 's development - an end to agricultural subsidies in the developed world , which cripple african producers ' attempts to earn money on the international market .
the zambian deputy finance minister felix mutati said : " what we need most is fair trade because our farmers can not compete with farmers in the west .
" the whole issue of trade hinges on farm subsidies and the quicker this is resolved the better . "
as for climate change , this is a problem that poses africa serious problems .
but to many on this continent , the difficulties of simply carving out a day-to-day existence make the future threat of changes to the climate issues that people are too busy to worry about .

they pledged to increase aid to the developing world by $ 50bn -lrb- £ 28.8bn -rrb- and to write off the debts of africa 's 18 poorest countries , although african nations had called for the debts of all africa to be cancelled .
bbc correspondents in key african nations assess what the g8 agreement means where they are .
barnaby phillips : south africa the g8 agreed to make anti-aids drugs widely available across africa african leaders had waited a long time for the g8 summit , and were worried that the london bombs would take the focus away from their continent at the last moment .
in the event , their fears were not realised , with tony blair apparently determined that africa should remain top of the agenda .
mr blair said that agreements reached at gleneagles gave " real hope " that african poverty could be ended .
the increases in aid will be welcomed across africa , although it will take time for african governments , and their people , to assess to what extent they will benefit .
africa will also be looking for more detail on promises to write off the debts of the poorest countries .
fourteen african countries already knew they were going to benefit from debt cancellation , while others will now be waiting anxiously to see whether they are included .
the biggest disappointment will be with the vague commitments the g8 has reached on trade - even mr blair admitted that he would have liked to have gone further here , to reach agreements on specific dates for the phasing out of subsidies .
cotton farmers in west african countries like burkina faso and mali , and sugar cane farmers in southern african countries like swaziland and malawi , will derive little comfort from the g8 meeting .
anna borzello : nigeria one in five africans is nigerian , and 70 % of the population live on less than a dollar a day , which means any attempt to deal with poverty in africa has to deal with the west african giant .
in nigeria , the reality of most people 's lives is extreme poverty the nigerian president , olusegun obasanjo , who is also the chairman of the african union , has been manoeuvring since the start of the year to take advantage of the mood surrounding the g8 .
his goal has been to convince creditor nations that nigeria deserves debt relief , even though it is oil-rich and one of the most corrupt countries on the planet .
he was granted his wish last month , with a 60 % debt write-off .
it is a move that has been welcomed by nigerians , who feel it is unfair to pay back loans which were largely given to military dictators .
but there is also scepticism about whether the money saved will ever be used to benefit the needy .
many feel the root cause of poverty in nigeria is not a lack of aid , not the draining effects of debt and not even , in an oil-reliant economy , unfair trade terms .
instead , it is the way that the estimated $ 360bn -lrb- £ 207bn -rrb- nigeria has earned from crude oil since the 1960s has been squandered or stolen by successive regimes .
prime minister tony blair 's efforts to put africa high on the g8 agenda have largely been met here with pleasant surprise .
but most nigerians , when asked the best way to tackle poverty , invariably answer : " good leadership " .
adam mynott : kenya there have been just two cheers from africa for the g8 outcome .
the doubling of annual aid for africa to $ 50bn has been widely welcomed , but there are concerns about whether this commitment , due to come into operation by 2010 , will be followed through .
in kenya 's slums , people struggle from day to day kenyan finance minister david mwiraria said : " intentions and actualisation are not the same thing .
we would like to see a situation where there is money now . "
other critics have called the promises too vague , but the president of the african union , nigerian president olusegun obasanjo , who attended the meeting in scotland , said he was satisfied with the gleneagles deal .
he said the problems facing africa were being " realistically and acceptably " addressed by the international community .
he went on to pay tribute to the british prime minister .
" the meeting of the g8 leaders and african leaders in gleneagles is a great success and we thank and congratulate prime minister tony blair for the success achieved . "
many africans were looking to gleneagles to tackle what they see as the main obstacle standing in the way of the continent 's development - an end to agricultural subsidies in the developed world , which cripple african producers ' attempts to earn money on the international market .
the zambian deputy finance minister felix mutati said : " what we need most is fair trade because our farmers can not compete with farmers in the west .
" the whole issue of trade hinges on farm subsidies and the quicker this is resolved the better . "

the queen attended the ceremony in whitehall on saturday .
as part of the bbc wales news website 's series on wwii veterans , we talk to a ceredigion grandmother who risked her life in the fire brigade in the blitz .
gillian " bobbie " walton clarke , from lampeter , is one of only six surviving women given the george medal .
mrs clarke - who was born in london - signed up to the fire service in 1939 at the age of only 20 , initially just as a driver .
" i was with the fire brigade in london - i was stationed at dockhead in bermondsey , " said the 86-year-old .
mrs clarke met the queen mother when she won the george medal " i went there as a driver - there were two of us and we drove the station officer wherever he wanted to go .
but as soon as i was 21 , i put in for a heavy goods licence and passed . "
from then on , she had to drive a petrol lorry around the fire-hit streets , sometimes during attacks .
" we used to carry two galloon tins and filled up the trailer pumps with petrol - we had to keep the pumps going . "
but she said she did not feel particularly scared .
" you do n't think about it - the things happening when the fires were going .
you could hear the bombers , but you just got on with it .
" if you are going to be killed , you are going to be killed and that 's all there is about it . "
she was awarded the george medal for her bravery in a ceremony with king george vi in 1941 .
" it was awe-inspiring and i was very pleased that my mother was able to come with me to buckingham palace to collect it . "
mrs clarke worked with the fire brigade throughout the war mrs clarke , whose maiden name is tanner , has also been remembered by the fire service , which named a building at their training base in gloucestershire after her .
" they wrote to me and asked if we can name it after you , so i suggested tanner house - it is a great honour . "
she said the memorial in whitehall was a good way to remember the efforts of women left behind to keep farms running and the country going .
she had planned to travel to the ceremony with her two granddaughters - one of them , amanda jones , said she had not always known how brave her grandmother really was .
" as i was growing up , i just thought everybody 's grandparents must have done stuff like that , but more recently i realised perhaps really she is one in a million , " she said .
" it makes you appreciate her more and more . "
